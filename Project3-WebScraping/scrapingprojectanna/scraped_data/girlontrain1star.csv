"1",0,"Karen Russo","I was soooo disappointed! I'd looked forward to reading this book for weeks -- then finally got it, and ... It was so bad I actually returned it, something I've done so rarely I can't even remember the last time. I guess it was all the build-up -- it sounded so great, then the disappointment was so profound. I didn't finish it -- maybe read half, but when I realized that I simply didn't care what happened to any of them, I just quit. (Bad enough I paid $$$ for it. I didn't need to pay twice, by wasting time on it too.) In sum: very very very slow start. Confusing. Pointless. Just too esoteric for my taste. And as compared to 'Gone Girl'? Honestly, I don't see much of a comparison. I loved 'Gone Girl' -- read it twice, in fact, and liked it so much I don't want to see the film. The book was too good to ruin. "
"2",1,"Thays Ch","There was no thriller, I disliked all of the characters. I did not enjoy reading it. "
"4",3,"Lucy Ramirez","This book was extremely dark. I understand suspense but the time frame changed from chapter to chapter. I wondered about halfway why I was reading it. I wondered the same when it was over. "
"6",5,"Ronald Fitch","What an awful, awful book."
"11",10,"Amy Trostle","Depressing..... The whole book makes you feel as if a dementor is lurking nearby just waiting to suck out your soul."
"12",11,"Harriet Lobascio","Why do I feel compelled to finish a book? Should have stopped and put it back on a shelf. Wimpy women with no direction."
"13",12,"Liz Harmath","I tried, I really did. The first 60 pages practically killed me, but after that it became somewhat interesting and I was able to get to the end. But I had to really work at it. About 75% of the way through, I started wondering how I WANTED it to end and couldn't come up with any satisfying options. Lots of twists and turns to keep you guessing until the end, but I just don't think it was worth my time. Ugly, unhappy people doing ugly things. There's really no bright spot here."
"14",13,"Miechele Summers","All of the characters, with the exception of the main characters roommate, were pathetic, self-centered people that I would never want to know. I was hoping for twists and turns in the plot, including a surprise ending; however the villain could be spotted 100 pages away. "
"15",14,"Jon Lyon","didn't live up to the hype...not even close"
"17",16,"Erin Kasper","Hated it. Read for a book club meeting, started and stopped so many times I gave up and returned to the library. Ugh. The main character wasn't likeable, the story itself was repetitive in her actions and loss of memory, and honestly I was hoping to just get through it."
"18",17,"Leigh Gaston","Such a complete downer. Couldn't even finish it. "
"20",19,"Sue Hatchett","I would give this less than one star if possible. Not one character in this story was worth rooting for. "
"22",21,"Laiel"," There is so much fuss about this book from amazon & goodreads-= with soaring reviews and recommendations. I had my hopes up thinking that I finally found a good book to read. To my dismay, every chapter was a torture. Such a waste of time. The characters are all one dimensional and the plot itself was not interesting nor intriguing.God, I never hated a book as much as this one. At least, ""Gone Girl"" was a page turner and had better writing. I can at least say that the quality of popular literature nowadays is going down the drain."
"23",22,"Sandi","I wish there was a minus rating. This book.is dire - don't bother with it."
"24",23,"Chrissy","Oh ugh. Don't waste your time. This book is depressing and all characters are completely unsympathetic without any redeeming qualities. It's a quick read but totally unsatisfying in the end. "
"25",24,"Ken Smith","I mostly used this book to help me fall asleep. The female characters were excessively emotional and incapable. I honestly didn't know what was going on and was okay with that. But I did finish it for whatever it's worth. "
"27",26,"Paul","I absolutely hated this book. It was so slow moving, and the main character is completely unlikeable. The ""twist ending"" did not do enough to satisfy slogging through the first 8 hours of reading this."
"28",27,"Lucaslu1626","Actually it's a pretty mediocre thriller, I have no idea why this book's been so popular."
"29",28,"Sandy","I guess I'll just stick with good ol' Agatha Christie."
"30",29,"Obed Marquez","Personally I couldn't see the crazy hype on The Girl On The Train. I tried. I really tried, I really REALLY tried. I even finished the book even though I was at 50% and I was still wondering... is this story going anywhere at all?Not to mention the extremely cheap plots. Oh sure, the woman is easy and likes going around with men. Big surprise. The only possible ""big"" plot was who the killer was. And even that was ... very... very sad. So... Yeah. You needed someone to blame so why not do it on a character which you portrayed as a perfectly lovely and kind human being through the whole book? This character just turns out to be absolutely crazy. Without given much of a hint to the reader, just, Plop! GIve it or take it.It was OK. Not bad, but simply OK. Wouldn't recommend the book."
"31",30,"My Pink Fairytales","DFRi stopped at 5% because i was bored out of mind and i thought it will be like until the end...not my type at all. but why in the God's name i bought it?"
"32",31,"Claude","Monotonous, boring and pointless. "
"33",32,"Pamela Richards","After all the hype about this book I was really looking forward to reading it. What a disappointment! Yes, the ending was good but what a boring journey to get there! I couldn't empathise with any of the characters and all the jumping about was very confusing. I didn't really care what had happened to Rachel because she was not a likeable character at all. All in all, time wasted that I'll never get back. Only finished it because I hardly ever give up on a book!"
"34",33,"Ellen Taylor","Betrayal, lies, forgotten memories, drunken semiconscious events in a flashback then present timeline... Head hurt yet? This book reminds me of the same feeling I had after I finished Gone Girl.... Not a redeeming character in the whole sorry story.... "
"35",34,"Jiny","Two thirds through the book and I could not keep going. All the characters are messed up, especially the protagonist Rachel. All the female characters remind me of bored housewives of the 50s- boring and melodramatic. It's one of those stories the characters so different from myself that I can't relate and/or sympathize. (view spoiler)[Every time Rachel does something, I think to myself, ""WHYY WOULD YOU DO THAT? It makes NO SENSE AT ALL!"" The dichotomy between her logic and actions is agitating, and her emotions are just everywhere. She's constantly stuck in a rut because she either does nothing or the wrong thing.No job? Most people would try to find a job. But she has a drinking problem and an ex that she can't get over. The break up happened long ago, why is she so obsessive? Her drinking problem contributes to most, if not all, of her problems. She should get help and try to quit it, instead she's trying to find distraction in a murder case that doesn't even involve her.For the whole time I suspected the plot twist is that Rachel was the murder: She killed Megan because she hated cheaters. That would've explained her obsession with the case. But it wasn't her.The ending was interesting and worthy of a mystery novel. But it took too long to get there, and the main character(s) are not interesting enough to keep me until the end. (hide spoiler)]"
"36",35,"Karen Brown","First Gone Girl and now this! I am seriously questioning the New York Times Bestseller Lists. Obviously my opinions must differ greatly from the masses, but what is the world coming to when this is the kind of book that people like to read?!This is a poorly written book with almost no plot (highly predictable). The characters are insipid, unlikable and undeveloped. I kept reading hoping it would either get better or I wouldn't be able to guess the outcome. Neither happened. "
"37",36,"Chanae","I really hated this book right from the beginning. Every few pages was a different day, and I was constantly flipping back and forth to see how much time had passed since the last date. So that was annoying. I loathed the main character Rachel. There was seriously nothing I liked about her so consequently I didn't care about her at all. She was just sooo stupid! I didn't like Anna or Megan either. Seriously, none of the characters had anything to like about them. It wasn't until page 228 (two-thirds) through the book that I felt even a glimmer of interest in the story. The rest of the book had some intense moments, but the women characters continued to make such stupid decisions, and were just not that great of people anyways. (Not that the men were either, but the women were the ones telling the story, so that's why I'm so critical of them.) And then the ending just didn't have the greatest closure. After all of Rachel's obsessing and details over the news and the disappearance earlier, we get one quick 'well this is what happened, now I'll just hope back on the train...'"
"38",37,"Nishta Mital","PREDICTIBLE"
"39",38,"Tracie","Many people like this book and even stated it was better than Gone Girl. I'm not one of those people. Oh, so boring, and the plot twist happens around page 300. Ain't nobody got time for that. Don't read this."
"40",39,"Yousif Alwatani","Okay. So, here's a summary of the characters in this book:-- Rachel, the protagonist, likes trains. Also, (view spoiler)[everything -literally, every-freaking-thing- reminds her of her ex-husband. That got so annoying and repetitive. Also, she forgets way too much. If not for her incredibly atrocious memory, this novel would literally not exist. 99% of the events occur because she's an alcoholic, and thus she can't bloody form memories like normal human beings. Seriously, does alcohol make you forget that often?- Anna falls in love with a married man and enjoys ruining a marriage. Althoug that marriage had it coming because of Rachel's drinking. Still - Anna hates Rachel way too much for no good reason. You ruined her life - at least have the courage to try to talk to her like an adult.- Megan is basically Anna times a hundred. ""She likes being wanted"". Also, she gets pregnant unintentionally way too often. Ever heard of contraception? And what was that about when she fell asleep in the tub with her newborn, and thus killing it? Who the hell does that? WHY, MEGAN, WHY? You deserve what happened to you.- Tom is a womanizer. He's the male version of Megan. You just can't find the right woman, can you, poor Tom? By the way, Megan slept with him.- Kamal Abdic the Bosnian psychiatrist was just a misdirection; to make the reader think that he was the sick criminal and to make them think he was Indian. He was just another man who slept with Megan.- Have I not mentioned Megan's husband, Scott? He slept with Megan, too. Obviously. But he also slept with Rachel less than a month after his wife died. Bad boy.- The red-headed dude is .. hell, I still don't know why he was there. A red herring.- Cathy and her partner were decent. Cathy was awesome. I wish there was more of her. It would've been a real twist if somehow she was linked to the murder. I kept thinking that she seemed almost too uninvolved not to be involved (if that makes sense). She turned out to be just an awesome friend. Respect.  (hide spoiler)]"
"42",41,"Mark Adkins","I was not a fan of this book, the only reason I finished it was because I hate to leave a book unfinished.I did not like the way this book was written, changing the point of view of the book from character to character depending on the chapter. This style of writing can be effective (read George R.R. Martin's series A Song of Ice and Fire). Unfortunately when I read this book I can not really see any difference between the characters and unless I saw the name at the chapter title I could not tell that it was a different character. "
"43",42,"Sally","Found internal monologue of main characters depressing introverted, stopped reading it"
"44",43,"Jonathan Silva","Uneventful story, unlikable main character. Can't understand the hype. Couldn't get behind any of the main characters, found the story to drag, and the ultimate twist was not really a twist at all."
"46",45,"Andrew Zajicek","took the bait, regretting it now. The book is written to emulate the Gone girl experience but I just could not finish it. As opposed to the Gone girl, this book is not interesting; it isn't compelling and is slow as molasses. I couldn't find anything interesting in the life of an alcoholic and her days, and delusions and thoughts. after the initial spark of interest, I started skipping pages and in the end I just skipped to the end just to see if I should go back and read it fully. (I didn't).if you want to read a good book, with similar structure, and have already read the Gone girl, read ""The Life we bury""."
"48",47,"Denise Power","This was the most appalling book I've ever read. Utterly crap."
"49",48,"Merrily","Noot my type of book. Disliked it as much as Gone Girl."
"53",52,"Jennifer Corey-Cutlip","I never finished this book. I just couldn't. I wanted to give up much sooner, but I kept at it, thinking it would get better. It just didn't. I never finished Gone Girl. I was bored with that one too. I thought Gone Girl the movie was awful too. People were posting that this book was like Gone Girl, but much better. I borrowed the sample on Kindle to see if I would like it. The sample was great. It hooked me in and I HAD to read it, so I got the book. Not much after what I read in the sample was any good. I love thrillers, so this was disappointing. Unless you get this book for free, and have nothing else on hand to read, I wouldn't waste the time or money!"
"54",53,"Lauren Haarlow","Do not read this book. So painful. Depressing, gut wrenching. Just don't."
"55",54,"sylie","Sometimes I wonder if there is some dark, disturbed side of me that I am unaware of, or if I just read too many books and watch too many TV shows/movies. I guessed the big twists in Gone Girl about 30 pages in, and I guessed the big twist in The Girl on the Train about 10 pages in. Needless to say, that made reading the rest of the book a complete bore. Every single character in this book is a caricature, the writing is mediocre at best, and the manufactured suspense just drags on and on. The book's treatment of women, and especially its presentation of a modified Madonna/whore dichotomy, is abysmal; I can tell it's reaching to be some sort of social commentary like Gone Girl sometimes was, but the result just isn't there.Also, despite all the comparisons I make to Gone Girl, and despite what its publishers desperately want you to believe, this book isn't really anything like it. And, full disclosure, I didn't like Gone Girl either, but at least I liked it more than The Girl on the Train."
"56",55,"Harvey","is this Britain's response to Gone Girl? seriously? what a bore."
"57",56,"Tara S.","Osborne Cox said it best: ""You are part of a league of morons. Oh, yes. You see, you're one of the morons I've been fighting my whole life. My whole fucking life. But guess what... Today, I win. [gun shot]""This book would make a great Lifetime movie. It reminded me of why I despise and hence avoid Lifetime movies. I suppose my main complaint (if I have to pick just one) was that the three central female characters were weak, self-involved, and thoroughly unintelligent human beings, especially Rachel and Anna. Fluff and nonsense of the most unpleasant variety."
"58",57,"Linda Mccormick","What a waste of time. The ""girl"" is a 30-something raging alcoholic aimlessly riding trains to run away from her own life. She fantasizes about the lives of a young couple she sees from her seat. Are they so ideal? No. Not one person in this book is who they appear to be or even particularly likable. I'd like to think that perhaps Paula Hawkins was trying to assemble a cast of characters so despicable that at the end of the book, the joke is on the reader for taking the time to care about them at all. If so, bravo. Have fun cashing those lovely checks, Ms. Hawkins.The book has been compared to Gone Girl, but it is a far less compelling read. "
"61",60,"Gina Fava","I wanted to see what all the hoopla was about...I still don't comprehend the hype. It took me forever to get into the book. Without the hype, I would've put it down by the end of the first chapter. Then I waited...by the end of the book, I was sorely disappointed. Though the premise was intriguing, and the writing was quality. The pace was slooooooooow. Wow, the characters just seemed to walk around from place to place with no purpose, a lot. Forget suspense, there was none. And skipping from POV to POV was exhausting and thoroughly distracting. I liken the characters to those in The Great Gatsby - drunken, back-stabbing slobs with no moral fiber. At least Gatsby had Nick to imbue some moral compass, but this book dragged on and on with an entirely expected and dissatisfying ending. Next time, I won't succumb to the pressure of the top of The List; instead, I'll just trust my instincts and put the book down."
"62",61,"Joeri","This book should be in the ""Bored with my life, housewife genre.""If you liked 50 shades, you'll love this. It's equally horrible. They throw in a few characters just to fill the pages. And the main character is a disgrace to alcoholics everywhere. "
"63",62,"Halona","Each character is so utterly shallow and unlikable I stopped caring about the mystery. "
"65",64,"June","I finally finished this Book! With all the hype and so many wishes for it, I had high hopes of a can't put down thriller. Boy, was I wrong! I hated the characters, they were miserable and pathetic and I didn't feel for any of them. The story was confusing at times, going back and forth with three women speaking and forgetting who was saying what! I had to go back to see which woman was doing the talking. There was nothing outstanding about this book."
"66",65,"Mary Beth","Depressing. Kept waiting for something exciting to happen. Very slow and just so depressing!"
"68",67,"Sassy","Well, I could have done without reading this one. I didn't like a single character. Each one was wrapped up in herself or himself; such shallow, self-centered individuals, all looking at others with envy or hatred. Maybe it came off so terrible as I had just finished reading The Light Between the Oceans and the contrast was more than I could bear. "
"75",74,"Misteeyed","Another tale about depressed crazy people; there is no redeeming value in another fictional read about the inner life of the mentally ill. A public library selection I mistakenly made."
"76",75,"Rebecca H","One of the worse books I've read. I have no idea why it was on so many best seller lists."
"79",78,"Bárbara ","I can't believe once again I wasted hours of my life reading this book, I never thought I would ever read again a book as bad as Gone Girl, but I did. So slow, depressing, the characters are just pathetic and stupid.. I will never again read a best seller, they mostly sucks, like this one."
"83",82,"Brian","Poorly done, extremely boring for the middle nine-tents, I have no idea why this book is a best seller. "
"84",83,"Lu","I'm surprised this book has gotten so much attention. The characters are all the same- drinking, lying, cheating. There is no scope or depth to any of them and I didn't give a hoot for any of them! "
"86",85,"Palak","I found every single character in this book exceptionally annoying, screwed up and without a single redeeming quality. Everyone's had a dark past and seemed to be heading towards a darker future. Hardly any 'mystery' there. This was a very frustrating read! "
"87",86,"Liz","I just closed the cover of this book with the greatest shrug in the universe. There was literally nothing about The Girl on the Train that I liked--I did not find it well written, I did not connect with a single character, and I found the plot frankly ridiculous. Additionally, I think it is quite frankly offensive to both alcoholics and domestic abuse victims.The worst thing about this book were the flat and boring characters.. The book follows three different women that live outside of London. They are the most boring women in the world. Rachel is what I would consider the main character in the book (she is the The Girl on the Train). Rachel, as we learn 5,000 times, is a severe alcoholic. We learn this because she's drinking in scenes a lot, she talks about wanting a drink, and she says her drinking ruined her marriage. There is no nuance to her addiction. The biggest nuance we get is that her inability to conceive is why she started drinking...which, ok. That is certainly a trigger that could lead to alcoholism but the her character is ""I couldn't have a baby so now I am an alcoholic."" All we see is her stumbling around being very drunk which, quite frankly, is so insulting to many alcoholics. It is just way over the top.But what is most frustrating about this (and I credit my friend Abby for this insight) is that her alcoholism IS basically what the plot revolves around. Rachel can't remember what she saw the night Megan died because she was blackout drunk. The ENTIRE book is trying to figure out what she saw when she was blacked out. In addition, Rachel would also know Tom, her ex husband, was a suspect if she wasn't super drunk every time he abused her. So not only has Paula Hawkins thrown alcoholism in the mix, now domestic abuse is a plot point and a fucking CLUE that Tom is the murderer. In addition, Rachel is hugely unsympathetic (which wouldn't be a problem if every character in this book wasn't garbage). She is stalking her ex husband (oh those alcoholics!!), stalking people she happened to watch from the train (oh alcoholism!!), and sleeps with Megan's husband (do I have to say it again)? Then we have Anna. Anna was Tom's mistress when he was married to Rachel and she is so damn proud of it. You never stop hearing about how proud she is of being a mistress (which, fine, but does it need to CONSTANTLY be a thing). And you know what else she is proud of? Her kid. Because every woman in this book is defined by children and by men. She hates Rachel because Rachel is stalking her, no surprise there. She is the least dimensional character in the book because she's just has these emotions: I love Tom/Kid, I hate Rachel, I loved being a Mistress, I miss looking pretty. Paula Hawkins, you wrote this character and thought ""Yes, that's a complete person."" No.Megan, who gets murdered by Tom, is also defined by pregnancy and children. Because guess what? She's pregnant and when Tom finds out he kills her! She also accidentally drowned her baby when she was 18, which is sad, but so...random. The only reason I can think Hawkins put it in there was, besides that she loves babies, is that she wanted Megan to have motive to keep the baby. But even that doesn't make sense because Megan doesn't want kids throughout the whole book because of this accident with her baby. She tells her therapist/lover about drowning the baby and she feels better, but now she just wants to have babies suddenly? Anyway outside of the babies, Megan is portrayed as restless-she's just so fucking restless. That is literally all she is. She is restless so she keeps having affairs. Which..ook, but still not a person nor a character.I am going to start wrapping this up because I got to the crux of this book's issue. But finally, the ""surprise"" in this book is that Tom is the murderer. There is a reason that it is not a surprise. The book quickly rules out that Kamal, Megan's other lover, and Scott, her husband, didn't kill her. So either it's one of the women or it is Tom. The women are far, far too basic to ever be considered suspects. I will admit I didn't suspect Tom at the start but the minute it is lightly suggested it is just obvious it is him. But am I supposed to be shocked? You never meet Tom at all in any substantial way. So...who cares? It doesn't even matter if I didn't see it coming immediately, because I just don't even care. Final thought: Rachel kills Tom with a corkscrew, because you know, she's an alcoholic and it is SYMBOLIC? And she doesn't drink anymore after that? Are you kidding me? WHAT. She's just better now even though she still wants to drink. I guess that's just the magic cure.I don't understand the hype of this book. It would have maybe made a good tv show or, if we are being honest, a Lifetime movie. I would actually probably watch that Lifetime movie. "
"90",89,"Tammy Matthews","You can do so much better than waste your time with this novel. If you're looking for the next Gone Girl, maybe just go back and re-read Gone Girl. You'll find far more interesting and well-drawn characters and insanely brilliant plotting.Not so with this. For those who like to keep up on the Kardashians and read their supermarket tabloids like they're essential news, I guess this novel is intriguing. You'll take sordid fascination in Rachel nosing into other people's lives. If melodrama is not your thing though, you'll find this book painfully dull.It's pretty bad in a mystery when you get so tired of the author leading you around by the nose from suspect to suspect in such a heavy-handed way. Halfway through I just stopped caring."
"95",94,"Kay","This book was so popular that I was curious. It turns out that it's like Gone Girl (which I also didn't like that much) but is much worse. It's both badly written and a bad book. The premise is something someone in a college creative writing class might come up with: What if there's a secret life behind that woman you see on the train??? I may have even written some version of this for a short story in my college elective creative writing class (I am not a good fiction writer). The thriller has some tension, but it relies heavily on the main-characters-are-unlikable trope that's so popular in modern fiction. It actually also took me a while to figure out that there were actually three different characters (this is partially a problem with the Kindle version, where the lettering at the top of the chapters is in light gray and hardly visible) since they don't have voices very distinctive from one another. A very smart lady I know said she liked that it was a book featuring a character who was an alcoholic. I agree that it's good to portray more characters like this, but I can't say I know enough about alcoholism to know how accurate the portrayal was. It also bordered on tedious, with her constant references to the canned gin and tonics and the glasses of wine. This is, perhaps, intentional, since alcohol is such a central part of an alcoholic's life, but as a reader it's boring. There's probably a good way to do this, but maybe this is not it. In any case, this book seems totally skippable. Unlike Gone Girl it's hard to imagine it making a good movie. Maybe there's something Lifetime could do with it. "
"97",96,"Renee","Didn't live up to the hype for me."
"98",97,"Dylan","I did not finish this book, which rarely happens. I got to page 147 and was done.I was not impressed or captivated by all of the drinking and all of the cheating. I did not look forward to reading this book and I did not care what happened next, which was an early indicator that I was not enjoying it. It wasn't necessarily a bad book, it just wasn't for me."
"99",98,"Mariam","This is what I think of this book "
"100",99,"Marian","We-ell, I can't rightly call it ""read"" but if it's a service to others, let the record show I could not read as much as five pages. The writing is such a bore, and to the extent I could pick up on anything more substantial, my instinct was that the characterization was going to PISS ME THE HELL OFF. I later listened to a podcast discussion of the book, in which one critic (full disclosure: a friend) indicated that a person stuck on a long train ride with only this book to read would be better off passing the time looking out the window. "
"101",100,"Will","Struggled my way through this book.The main character is unlikeable, she's an alcoholic who is drunk most of the time, and she takes the metro train past these houses (one of which she used to live in happily married - until she discovered she was barren and her husband cheated on her, thus dissolving their marriage).She always sees this couple in a house (near her old one) and creates fake happy back-stories for them, until she sees in the news that the wife goes missing. The premise seems more exciting than the novel was, at times dragging on and really going no where. There were so many unnecessary situations and interactions that occurred which ultimately did not lead to anything, and did not add to the plot. So frustrating.It also reminded me, in a way, of Gone Girl. A poor man's version. But don't read into my comparison regarding the ending of GG - the plot twists and ending are much different. "
"102",101,"Esther","Lento, aburrido y muy previsible"
"104",103,"Janette","I hated this book! If you want to torture yourself and if you want to read about extremely dysfunctional, drunk, and crazy people, then this is the book for you! I was totally mislead about this book. I can't believe I actually read it. UGH"
"105",104,"Jeanette","ok not truly read - i had to skip 30% of the book and go to the end. This may have been a good story but really is was so full of pathetic, un-enjoyably characters, the suspense did not outweigh the horrible slow story development. "
"106",105,"Farrell","Abandoned. I just could not get into it. I could see that everyone's paths were interwoven (sorry not sure if that is a spoiler, you figure it out after less than 50 pages in), but Rachel's alcoholism and Megan's thoughts just didn't keep me interested. Maybe I can try again sometime..."
"108",107,"Ruxandra","Too depressing for me to finish the book, the suspense was not enough for me to care about who murdered Megan. Every time I tried to read this book I ended up spoiling my mood, I just really didn't like it."

"112",111,"Breann","Really don't understand the hype around this one, I couldn't finish it."
"113",112,"Irene","I found this book rather boring. I couldn't relate to the main character. I keep reading slowly because I thought it would get better, but it didn't."
"114",113,"Catherine Davison","My one star rating actually has an invisible minus sign in front. This book was rubbish. I'm not even going to waste my time typing all the reasons this book failed to engage me. It's not my type of writing, I know others enjoy it, the hype and five star reviews attest to that but I found it ludicrous."
"115",114,"Kulpreet","boring... and an end that just had no connect didn't make sense at all"
"116",115,"Ian Carpenter","I liked this book less and less as I went on (despite so many of my friends loving it) and by the end... I think I hated it. I thought the writing was mediocre. So much of went on with the characters was very repetitious with the repetition grouped around gender. The men all do this, the women all do that. And the mechanism of the story telling - someone piecing together their selectively lost memories from a night when someone dies - was frustrating and the revelations felt arbitrary and convenient. And the final revelation, which is what kept me around till the end, was hardly earth shattering.I wish I hadn't read it and the fact that this is a buzz book leaves me baffled. "

"118",117,"Nicole Cavaricci","depressing From beginning to end a sad story of a depressed person. No real point or substance. I felt compelled to finish but even that was sad."
"119",118,"Jules","Wow this book was soo bad I can't believe I managed to make it till the end, and that I got sucked into reading it in the first place.As over-hyped and overrated as it is, it's just a tedious glimpse into messed up lives of people so dull it hurts: a nosy oblivious alcoholic; a wifey with no life or concerns other than her child and her husband (who btw left the nosy alcoholic for her); and another wifey with vague past and perfect present which she still manages to be utterly dissatisfied with (that makes her whore around with several guys, one of them being the already mentioned dude who left the alcoholic for another chick). These women are pathetic idiots who are totally dependent on their husbands/lovers/exs etc, and the biggest life struggle they seem to be dealing with throughout the entire novel is their boredom and filling up their days. Sadly, only one of these idiots dies. In addition to being pathetic, the characters are predictable and underdeveloped. The writing is clumsy and simple, and the author's style, as well as vocabulary, is just primitive. The book is full of eye-rolling moments which I'd rather not mention to save myself from all the superfluous rant. The story itself is 'shrouded in mystery' and the nicest, sweetest and most caring character turns out to be the villain (shocking!!!!)Makes me wonder how shallow books like this one can be that popular. "
"120",119,"Alan Medcalf","This carefully plotted psychological thriller relates the stories of an alcoholic, a liar and a cheat, all in a self-indulgent voyeuristic manner. I found it intellectually simple which usually means quick entertainment, yet it was a tough slog -- it just never caught my imagination. "
"121",120,"T.A. Uner","This was painful to read: an unlikeable, shallow character engaging in adultery like wildfire. Another unlikeable character who's a whining drunk. But this book has already found its audience and will probably be made into a movie. I gave up after a few chapters. Despite this I wish the author well but it just wasn't for me."
"122",121,"Pam Klimper","Much like Gone Girl which I enjoyed. Just couldn't get into this one so I quit reading about a third of the way through. "
"125",124,"Azy Kia","I don't get it....what's the buzz over this book about? Although it is certainly an easy read, I didn't find it to be the 'page-turner' others seem to describe it as. I found the character voices to be undifferentiated and the climax/resolution of the story to be unsatisfying. The interplay of dates and narrators created a vagueness that kept some curiosity alive throughout the book, but ultimately not enough to consider this a 'thriller'. "
"126",125,"Nuno Xarepe","Just ew. Couldn't read it. Stopped in page 50."
"128",127,"Donna Taormina","An unlikeable book about a host of unlikeable characters. I cared so little for the people and the plot that not even a sense of curiosity could get me to even finish the last 50 pages. When you sigh every time you pick up a book with the attitude that you're soldering on with it, that's a signal to just quit and move on to something more entertaining. "
"130",129,"Pati","A premissa é interessante e promete suspensa com um ""que"" de Hitchcock, e me fez pensar em Janela Indiscreta. Rachel pega o mesmo trem todas as manhãs, que pára numa estação de onde ela pode assistir o cotidiano de um casal, a quem ela apelida de “Jess e Jason”. Até que um dia ela vê algo chocante. E a partir dai as coisas começam a acontecer.Apesar desta boa premissa, com o virar das páginas a impressão que eu fui ficando foi: 1) não gosto nem um pouco destes personagens, o que parece esta virando trend, desde o tremendo sucesso de Gone Girl; 2) não tenho problema com personagens desagradáveis, até os prefiro aos heróis, desde que sejam bem construídos e envolventes, o que sinceramente, não senti aqui; 3) existe a idéia de suspense e do famoso “quem foi?”, mas a resposta é bem óbvia se você parar para pensar e se a autora não recorrer ao deus ex machina para resolver o mistério; 4) os personagens femininos parecem ser basicamente uma só mulher dividida em 3 e 5) o livro tem tantos momentos nada a ver que eu me peguei mais de uma vez balançando a cabeça de um lado para o outro, pensando em qual livro eu deveria estar lendo ao invés deste.O livro é chato, deprimente e não oferece nenhum prazer, a não ser o alívio de ter acabado. Definitivamente, não recomendo."
"131",130,"Melissa H.","Blah blah blah. A poor attempt at the Gone Girl crowd, but where Gone Girl was subtle & pitch-perfect this one is a hatchet job. The neuroses of the characters are so over-wrought & I have no patience for any of them-- & I'm a psychologist. At 134 pages in, I'm calling uncle."
"135",134,"Jama","did not care for this book"
"137",136,"Carol Hammal","I don't know what people are raving about and why they call it a page turner. I'm by page 46, bored to death, it's depressing and still not seeing a point from this slow slooooowwww redundant story telling style with a diary-like format. I can get the point of why it's formatted that way but I'd expect the writer to make it more interesting and making me want to read more. This book is supposedly a thrilled and I haven't had the chance to get thrilled till now. I'm sorry but if a book doesn't catch my attention by the 20th age, it is not a page turner. If I still have to wait till page 100 for things to start happening then this book is unfortunately too slow and can't consider it a ""thriller""."
"138",137,"Jennifer Smith","I bought this while traveling - wish I would have played solitaire instead. The characters were so flawed I couldn't care what happened to them. I guessed who the murderer was early on. I wasn't interested enough to actually read all the way to the end so I skipped to the end just to confirm my guess. "
"139",138,"Madey","Disliked this book... forced myself to finish it, though I frankly regret that!! Annoying.... confusing... absurd dysfunctional characters. Saw no point in this story. "
"142",141,"Shama","Very ..very dark. I learned more about how alcoholic, sad, unfaithful and annoying the characters were than the actual story. I don't recommend this at all. Watch the movie instead. "
"144",143,"Jessica Murphey","Pass."
"145",144,"Steve Baribeau","I was disappointed. Initially, I was confused as to who the point of view was and discovered it was by chapter and name, which starts a year apart and throughout the book the point of view of the narrators ends up simultaneous. I don't need all books to be happy, but I don't recall any part of the story that was even lighthearted. Mostly, it was cringe worthy, all characters were not only flawed, but there wasn't a likeable person in the bunch."
"147",146,"Linda Reck","The Girl on the Train is a taut psychological debut novel. It's narrated by three deluded and flawed women. Rachel plots revenge on Anna, who ran off with Rachel's husband. Anna will do anything to protect her marriage. Married, Megan lies to her therapist, the chief suspect when Megan disappears. Hawkins's novel ends with a twist that no one, least of all, the victims could have seen coming. The surprise-packed narratives hurtle toward a stunning climax, horrifying as a train wreck and just as riveting. The Girl on the Train is the kind of slippery, thrilling novel that comes around only every few years."
"148",147,"Charlene Mitchell","Shockingly bad "
"149",148,"Sharron","Oh why didn't I listen to my friends and skip this one. I can find nothing positive to say about it. "
"151",150,"Michelle Schneider","Did not like this book. Very difficult to empathize with characters."
"152",151,"Lauren Tancock","This was marketed to me as a thriller similar to Gillian Flynn novels. It's not that. It's a giant mess of alcoholism, sex addiction, and all around unlikeable characters. There is not a single character with redeemable qualities, save the poor yet outrageously kind roommate of the protagonist. Save yourself the hassle and just watch old episodes of Ricki Lake."
"153",152,"julianne","What a disappointment. I really really tried to like this but it was far too melodramatic for me. I loathed the characters and wished they'd all just die. Poorly written and badly worked out plot."
"154",153,"Anne Maesaka","This is one of the worst book I have read in a long time. There are no likable characters in this book. The author seems obsessed with women losing their children. Almost makes me wonder if she wrote this book as therapy for a loss. It is most definitely not a thriller, it is actually very slow in some parts. Would not recommend it to anyone. "
"156",155,"William","I despise this book, it is like watching a teenage horror movie where everyone constantly makes the wrong decision for the wrong reasons. "
"157",156,"Jeanne","Wow. I am not having good luck lately. This book was billed as another engrossing Gone Girl unreliable narrator mystery. One problem is that the plot is pretty thin. The other problem is that it is told in the first person from three different narrators, but they all have exactly the same voice, as if the same person is speaking. It seems basic and I can't understand how a decent editor would let this go because in order for the story to be somewhat believable, it has to sound like the characters are actually unique individuals. I'm annoyed."
"160",159,"Theresa Janssen","Started, but did not finish reading it. Knew what was going to happen and did not care."
"163",162,"Vik","Pathetic from start to finish. Depressing, unexciting and avoidable."
"164",163,"Chrystle","For being the ""it"" book of the year I was extremely disappointed. I had to force myself to at least get half way and maybe it will start to get interesting but nope. Total waste of time and huge let down."
"165",164,"H3dakota","I seem to be the odd person out on this story. I made it about halfway through, but I just cannot take the characters anymore. None of them are likeable. This one is going in the Cannot Finish pile for me."
"167",166,"Elinasambora","Did not live up to its hype. Unputdownable? More like putmetobed"
"168",167,"Cooper","If you liked Gone Girl, you'll like this book. Granted, I loathed Gone Girl to a greater degree, but this book had the same insipid, uninspiring plot line, and was filled with pathetic and uninteresting characters. I wish someone had told me of the similarity so I could have saved myself time and money. Rachel, the alcoholic main character, was such a irritating, shrew of a character, that I needed to drink just to get through the book. "
"169",168,"Tracey","I forced myself to finish this book because I wanted to know why so many people were making such a big deal about it. And I'm clueless! I spent most of the time reading this book thinking 'does the author seriously expect me to believe this shit?'. For example, Rachel is so drunk she doesn't even remember writing an email, yet the email has no spelling or grammatical errors. Rachel is physically attacked by Scott and he locks her in a room and she is so panic stricken because she believes he's the killer yet she looks thru his boxes of stuff BEFORE she tries to escape thru the window. Then all she does is scream her ex-husband's name who lives about four houses away instead of screaming for help. When she's kicked in the back by Tom in his backyard after she realizes he's the killer she doesn't even ""put up a fight because there's no point""and "" lets him lead her back into the house "". Why? She's not on a deserted island with him... He has neighbors....she could yell for help. I find Rachel's character so moronic I'm wishing Tom really does kill HER! And the ending leaves me wondering how stupid the detectives must be. Rachel goes for an obsessive, drunk, stalking,threatening , lying ex-wife to a self-defense victim just because the current wife says so. Moronic. Just like the book! "
"170",169,"Bridget","To be honest, I read the first 80 pages, and decided that I didn't like or care about any of the characters. So I skimmed the rest, to see if it got any more interesting to me. It didn't, and I liked the characters even less. The mystery was interesting I guess, but feeling how I did about the people, I just didn't care in the end what happened to any of them.Oh well. On to the next book ..."
"171",170,"Wendy King","I read this book on the beach. I finished this book hoping that I was wrong about the ending. I wasn't. Good, mindless vacation reading - nothing else. "
"173",172,"karen ","This is a really bad book. I don't know why I bothered finishing it. The structure was disorganized, the plot was cliche, there was no style or complexity to the writing and the characters didn't share a single redeemable quality between them. The story was so depressingly sordid, it made me long for a cleansing shower, followed by a walk in a field of wildflowers. How this book could be called a ""Best Seller"" is totally beyond me and it makes me sad to think that this is what so many folks want to read. Yuck, yuck and more yuck."
"174",173,"Sue Sundermeyer","Can't remember the last time I hated a protagonist as much as I hated Rachel Watson, the primary narrator of ""The Girl on the Train."" Yes, it's a sort of compelling mystery, but for me, sticking with it to find out what happened/happens was not worth all the time I had to spend in Rachel's silly head."
"175",174,"Iblena","Una intriga que va perdiendo interés en la medida que el desarrollo del argumento se torna mas predecible. Con mas de un cabo suelto y situaciones carentes de tensión.A lo que hay que agregar personajes que no son mas que estereotipos sin verdadera personalidad: Rachel alcohólica, desempleada y divorciada, es un mar de autocompasión, Anna la insegura y egoísta segunda esposa y por ultimo Megan la caprichosa y enigmática desparecida de turno.Inspirado en la venta indiscreta de Hitchcock...seguro que Cornell Woolrich esta sacudiéndose en su tumba. Malo Malo malo.."
"177",176,"Ciaran","Packed it in. Didn't like it. Nothing else to say really"
"178",177,"Alexander","I cannot imagine why people like this book. The characters are unpleasant and unsympathetic. The plot is thin and like a soap opera -- amnesia, infidelity, handsome psychiatrist, suspicious police officers... it is tedious and predictable and not very enjoyable."
"179",178,"Joan Henderson","Absolutely dire. Didn't waste time on finishing it!"
"180",179,"B","This may have been the worst book I have ever read.Ever.Like... including ""Twilight.""How? How could I dislike (hate? I might even hate) this book so much? It's about a woman disappearing, and another woman getting to the bottom of it. That sounds like a pretty sweet deal, and something totally up my alley.Allow me to elaborate. 1. This is neither a thriller nor a mystery. When you only have a cast of ~6 characters, it is stupidly easy to figure out who the bad guy is. The second the disappearance of Megan became a plot element, I knew who the murderer was. I had hope as I skimmed (yes, skimmed, I could not handle her terrible writing style to fully devote my time to it) toward the end that perhaps I was wrong; perhaps there would be a twist. But no. Like the train Hawkins leans on for imagery again and again, this book is a straight-shoot to the obvious. It never wavers and never changes course.2. Does Hawkins hate women? This is a serious question. The novel is written in first-person-narrative, varying from the points of view of three woman: a) A non-functioning alcoholic named Rachel. Her husband left her, she lost her job, and the author pens her as a pathetic slob who can't even be bothered to clean up her own vomit (literally). She ONLY fell apart because she couldn't have a baby and then her husband cheated on her. So, let me get this straight, dear author: Rachel's only value is being a wife and a mother? Take those away and there is nothing but a pathetic shell? Nice, real nice. Anyway, Rachel inserts herself into a missing person's case which, as far as she can see, has literally nothing to do with her. She lies, snoops around, and is generally a total creeper throughout the novel. She has zero redeeming qualities. She does not grow or change throughout the course of the book. b) A mother and wife named Anne. You want more to her character? Too bad. There is nothing else. Hawkins wrote her as mother and wife, full stop. Her sections revolve solely around her interactions with her husband and child. That's it. That's all. Like Rachel, she does not grow or change as the novel progresses. c) The missing person herself: Megan. She is in an emotionally abusive relationship and copes with this by cheating on her husband. She has baby issues and commitment issues. Like Anne and Rachel she has no job and no other personality elements other than her role as wife, lover, and potential mother. The only other women we have multiple interactions with are Rachel's roommate Cathy and a female detective who we know by her last name: Riley. Cathy is periphery: she hangs out with her boyfriend (and will readily ditch Rachel if her boyfriend is free and wants to see her) and she disapproves of Rachel's drinking. That's all we ever see of Cathy. As for Riley: she is a weird stereotype of a detective. She is a stony-faced woman-of-few-words who is weirdly suspicious of everyone she comes into contact with. None of her suspicions amount to anything, and she fades from view as the missing persons case goes from the capable hands of the authorities to the incompetent, clumsy, and infuriating hands of a non-functioning alcoholic (I bring the alcoholic thing up again because that is pretty much what defines Rachel. Hawkins is too lazy or too terrible a writer to give Rachel any real personality traits, so she just keeps hearkening back to the booze. Every single page in Rachel's narration makes reference to her wanting a drink, or drinking. Don't believe me? Go to the bookstore and flip through this trash for a second). I would classify the novel as follows:A book about how women need babies/husbands in order to define themselves. If they do not have these things, they spiral the drain of alcoholism and are generally unable to take care of themselves. Women without babies/husbands will insert themselves into married lives, and systematically try to tear apart what they so desperately want. I find Hawkins a deplorable person - to write her female characters in such a cardboard and vapid way when she is a woman herself? Are you serious? Who allowed this to be published? Hawkins trying to dress up her book with a half-assed, completely obvious ""mystery"" adds more insult to injury, because people (like me) expect intrigue. If you have read at least one other mystery/thriller novel in your life, you know who the bad guy is immediately, and spend the rest of the book reading about how much Hawkins hates women.The moral:Hawkins should not be writing, especially about women. If she hates herself so much she should go to therapy, and not cry on a soapbox to a confused, bewildered, disappointed, and even (in my case) outraged audience. "
"181",180,"Karl Jakobsson","Wow. This was truly the worst book I have ever read. Picked it up due to the many popular reviews. Characters are all a big mess and very annoying and extremely difficult to relate to. Don't want to sound sexist, but perhaps this book is more from and for a stereotypical female perspective? Anyway, would give it less then 1 star if possible! Horrible."
"182",181,"Jay Caselberg","Could not connect at all. Felt contrived. Had no identification with the protag at all. Just boring."
"184",183,"Kaylie","Too much hype for this book. I liked the idea of this book - a woman watches life pass her by, taking the same train every day and forming identities for the couple she sees out the window. Of course, one day her image of the couple is shaken when she sees another man with the woman. Later, when the woman goes missing, narrator Rachel gets further entangled.Not a bad idea for a novel, as it's sometimes thrilling and sometimes a solemn look at loneliness. But I hated its execution. Told from multiple perspectives, each woman in the book lives for one purpose: Wife or ex-wife. With minimal character development, there is no one to root for, and as the novel progresses, the story quickly becomes redundant, and the women start to sound the same.One final gripe: Why are books still minimizing women? There is no reason to call Rachel the GIRL on the train. She is a grown woman, capable of her own choices and the consequences that come from them. In literature and life, men and women deserve equal treatment and opportunities, and The Girl on the Train suggests women have no choice between housewife and independence for life fulfillment, leaving this feminist frustrated."
"185",184,"Natasha","Why on earth do books like these end up becoming a bestseller? I don't get it. It's bad. The characters are unlikeable and underdeveloped and no plot. A waste of my time. "
"186",185,"Keeley Giangrosso","If you love whiny, underdeveloped, weak female characters or sociopathic played out weak male characters that follow a weak plot line, then boy do i have the book for you!"
"188",187,"Candi Highsmith","Didn't finish it on audible. Just couldn't get into it."
"189",188,"Emma Sonck","Unlike a real train this book did not get to a destination for me. This book was really choppy and hard to get to the point. This book wasn't for me. "
"190",189,"Mina","I couldn't finish it. The narrator annoyed me with all her clueless decisions. I know that sounds awful because she is an alcoholic, but that seemed like a convenient literary trick to turn this into a mystery without it feeling real. Also read gone girl and while that was not my favorite book, I found it much better than girl on the train."
"191",190,"Janesbuchanan","Although the train theme was a potentially interesting one, I didn't like the characters or the writing and was happy I managed to finish it."
"192",191,"Char Crosby","a mystery to me.This book was a big disappointment to me. I had trouble keeping track of which character was speaking. The main plot seemed to tell about a girl who drank so much that she lost a bit more of herself with each day. She may have witnessed a murder, and seemed compelled to solve it, which was futile because her memory was so impaired. Sadly, I gave up after wading through about 60% of the book. (I know, the plot finally gets to the point, and I quit too soon!). Sorry to have wasted my time on this mess."
"193",192,"Rhonda","I really tried to like this book but I just couldn't ! I found the writing disjointed and the characters & plot depressing. The use of the train was creative, at first but I soon found its use to be annoying. Every setting in this book was just filled with drama and not in a good way. I just found the whole concept disappointing."
"194",193,"Angela","After reading this, I just don't think psychological thrillers are my thing :'( Very gripping though."

"199",198,"Syd","Says the f-word a lot. Story is very slow in beginning, and it is not what I thought it was going to be about."
"200",199,"Caterina","Reading what ""everyone else is reading"" always leads to a few hours of life I'll never get back. And so this happened again... my own fault for giving popular one more try. Delusional women, abusive men. If even just one of the characters had any backbone perhaps the story line wouldn't have been so never-endingly weak. If you're looking for intrigue, smart writing, interesting characters - you won't find those here."
"201",200,"Jasmine","I found this book tedious to read. All the characters are so messed up, self indulgent, and underdeveloped. I'm not sure why it is #1 on many lists. "
"203",202,"Cheryl Young","Hated it."
"204",203,"Holly Robinson","I know I'm probably in the minority, but I am really not sure why this is so highly recommended by some people. I had a hard time making it through to the end of the book it was so annoying and boring at times. It was difficult to have any connection with the protagonist and the story line dragged. Honestly, even the climax was pretty predicable. I wouldn't recommend to people who enjoy thrillers or crime dramas but maybe it is an interesting book to people who like slow story lines. "
"206",205,"Linnaea","I didn't finish this, i though everyone was a mess and I didn't care what happened to anyone. I got to Anna's 2nd narration and all I could think was ""honey, he cheated on his wife with you. I wouldn't be so smug."" Even though Rachel was a mess, I could feel some sympathy for her, but not enough to keep going. I looked up spoilers and may go back and try to re-read it. "
"207",206,"BooBee","Utter trash!! Almost a month & at 30% I just had to stop & just read past review spoilers. The book is so bad I thought I was going to gouge my eyes out!! "

"219",218,"Nora M.","I did not like this book. I found it disturbing."
"220",219,"Ally Mac","Was totally disappointed. I'm in awe of anyone that has the dedication to sit down and write a book....and finish it! Doesn't mean it's going to be good and this book was really quite dull. The idea sounded amazing and the book started off okay, if a little slow but then it just went off the deep end. I hated every single character and I found myself skipping pages and not in a 'what happens next' way but in a 'does anything exciting happen next?'.I wouldn't say DON'T read it but personally....meh."
"221",220,"G.R. Reader","Platform 2 for the 9.15 to Bestseller, stopping at Voyeurism, Obsession, Infidelity, Unreliable Narration, Amnesia, Insanity and Death. But if you miss it there's always the next one."
"222",221,"Maggie Gust","I could not finish this book. I do not understand the hype about it. Like ""The Goldfinch,"" I found this book poorly written and the characters detestable.

"236",235,"Keely Hallowell","How the hell is this book a best seller? A woman wrote a review of why people like this book so much and I agree. ""This is a book for people who don't read. This book is only so highly rated because people who read one book a year are picking it up for a flight or a vacation, etc. and become obsessed with it. You do stupid things like rave about 50 Shades of Grey and get terrible novels turned into movies. Go away."""

"242",241,"Papp Andrea","I can't imagine how this book won the 2015 choice awards. The protagonist being an alcoholic, without any feeling of responsibily, who hates herself. The kind of person we would never want to become, and try to avoid contact with. I can enjoy a book if I can somehow identify myself with the protagonist, but not with such a person... I felt irritated all the time while I was reading. I read the book as it was announced as one of the best book of the year... Actually, it was one of the worst reading for me. "
"243",242,"Laura Sgro","I read this in one sitting while I was in an airport, but only because I have a rule that I must finish every book I start. I was thoroughly unimpressed with this ""thriller."" I will say that some of the plot twists weren't predictable, which is always good, but some of them were so obviously forced to make the story ""work"" that they weren't even exciting. None of the characters were likable, so I didn't care what happened to any of them. I don't really get the hype of this book."
"244",243,"Nick Mancuso","Full of sloppy loping narration from three nearly identically voiced narrators, so indistinguishable in text that I had to rely on the name at the top of the page to remind me who was narrating, Hawkins neglects to render the world of her characters in any level of detail. She glosses over moments of emotional resonance and charges past any reverberations of consequence in an effort to create a false positive reading of an unreliable narrator. Wouldn't suggest to my worst enemy, but maybe to Sarah Palin, I'm not convinced she reads that often, and honestly anything at this point would be marked improvement."
"245",244,"Ria","did not even finish..."

"254",253,"Sharon Huether","There was nothing I liked about this book. The characters were so flawed they were sickening. I've never read a book where the phrase "" I'm so sorry"" was repeated so many times. Why all the hype? Someone said the book was similar to Alfred Hitchcock, totaly untrue."
"255",254,"Rayna","This was an easy read, so I guess it fit in with my recent need for easy quick reads, especially for a road trip. I had higher hopes for this book since it was receiving such great reviews.Like many, I have to say the characters are not likeable. With a cast that includes a drunk, a liar and a cheat, a jealous husband with rage (admittedly rightful rage) issues, the detached cheating wife, and the wife that stole her husband from another woman and was giddy about it, What's to like? Shocker that the husband cheated on his second wife. Although, probably an accurate portrayal of a self-loathing alcoholic that once thought she had it all and then lost it. Based on the entanglement and the set up of all the characters, there was only one person that could have been responsible, so the big reveal wasn't surprising. It just didn't make sense the way it unfolded. Based on the timeline...Megan started sitting for Anna after she had lost the gallery. According to the story, Tom and Megan first started seeing each other and he would stop by the gallery. Why in the world would he suggest she babysit. That is just dumb!!! I had to go back and look because it seemed that a Megan part I thought she was talking about the therapist was supposed to actually be a time she was with Tom. The whole thing about running off to Italy or somewhere, but even then the blend is stupid because she's talking about therapy and it doesn't make sense that it is Tom and not the therapist. I guess that's supposed to be the complexity of the situation and part of the big plot twist, but it made no sense. If she had been seeing him at the time she was sitting for them, some of it would have come across in the interaction when she was sitting for them. That would have made sense. She didn't even seem to think he was attractive. I might have been more likely to buy the story if there was nothing from Megan's point of view. "
"256",255,"Lianne","I did not like this book in any way. All of the characters were mean, immoral, disloyal, unfaithful selfish... Uugh. I wish I hadn't continued to read it; it got worse the farther it went on. Personally, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone"
"260",259,"Jean Lemm","I found this book very boring and a waste of time."
"262",261,"Bernardo Apraiz","Me he leído esta novela en Audiobook con ayuda de Amazon. Os puedo decir que es de las peores novelas que he leído jamás. Me gustaría hasta pedir mi dinero. "
"263",262,"Lisa Diane","I really expected to like this book, but didn't. I expected a rather Hitchcockian psychological thriller, with a troubled and alcoholic character I might not love, but whose journey, however dark, I would enjoy. Hating a character can be fun too! However, I just plodded through the novel, and didn't connect (like or dislike) with any of the characters. I also didn't like how it jumped from one point in time, then back to another. Good basic premise, but in the end, it didn't deliver. "
"264",263,"Paola Arcia","This is just as crappy as Gone Girl. Seriously, flat characters all around, predictable plot and ending. I read the beginning and was about to give up on it when I decided to read the end, with the thought that if the end was good, I'll go back and re-read the whole thing. Sadly, I didn't need to, the end was just as I thought. I'm seriously thinking on giving up on this genre."
"265",264,"Francesca Barontini","Deve troppo alla pubblicità che ne hanno fatto. Sembra di essere in uno dei tanti telefilm delle serie americane. Mi è parso davvero banale"
"266",265,"Cormac Healy","Just a very poor book. Predictable, slow-to-get-starting plot, not a single character who I liked, let along cared about. Really not sure what all the fuss is about with this one. It was with a great sigh of relief that I put it down safe in the knowledge I would never have to touch it again"
"267",266,"Magdalena Wajda","For me, the most overrated book of the year. Annoying characters, no-one there I could have liked in real life. For most of the time I wanted to give a solid kick to the central character. The novel was advertised as a thriller, in my opinion it was just plain boring. "
"270",269,"Lupe Dominguez","After seeing reviews and finally finding one with a spoiler that had the ending, I realized WHY I gave this book up so quickly....because I figured it out already and just didn't feel like ACTUALLY finishing it. Ugh. Sucks, I had high hopes for it, but at about page 50? I had to put it down and take it back to the library. I just didn't care. "
"271",270,"Deb Heinsey","I started to read this... I can typically read a book in two or three days. Had this one on loan from the library for 14 days and didn't finish it. Couldn't get past the first 100 pages and it wasn't a priority after that. "
"272",271,"James Sarah Madison","I didn't like to book.I hated, without abatement, every single one of the characters. I finished the book only because this is part of a 2016 reading project (in which we read a book a week, woo!). As a result of my general dislike of every character in the book, I also didn't particularly care what befell them. Really, until the end, they all seemed to deserve the horribleness of each other. Rachel alone is redeemed, and even that is just a tiny sliver of redemption (to me, at least).I particularly disliked the trope of a 'diary-esque' POV, in which we switch between the narrative of three different women. There is a time offset, which is done exclusively to create suspense. All it created in my was annoyance. Had I been reading a physical copy (I listened to it on Audiobook), I likely would have organized it and read it in chronological order. It was all just so MANUFACTURED. Ugh!YMMV, of course. I find very trite the manufacturing of drama due to a chronological offset. If you don't find this triggering, you may very well like the book. If you're a survivor of physical or emotional domestic abuse, you may very well find Rachel a compelling and compassionate character. And, if you're an alcoholic, there may be words of truth within the book for you. It's not poorly written, but for me, it was a book I'll be glad never to read again."
"277",276,"Ariane Lieberherr","Stopped reading it after a couple chapters. I found the story depressing and the characters a mess."
"279",278,"Dawn","Endless. Absolutely endless. It felt like it would go on forfreakingever! I have NO idea why this book received so many 5⭐️ ratings. The characters we unlikable, pathetic and flat. This is basically a book about a sad, uninteresting drunk who *shocking* gets drunk all the time. I'm just glad it's over. "
"280",279,"Cassie","I think my main problem with this book was that I couldn't relate with the main character and I didn't have pity for her at all. It's hard to enjoy a book when you don't enjoy the main character. I did stop reading at one point and did not continue for about a month. It is a slow read and I honestly just picked it up because I wanted to finish it. I like to try to predict the endings of my books and if I am right about the ending I tend to dislike the book more because it's predictable. This was definitely one of these books! "
"281",280,"Lynn K. Towne","TerribleThis book kept plodding towards the inevitable. I knew who the killer was early in the book. Yet I kept reading in fascination, thinking that surely it couldn't be THAT obvious. Well, it was obvious. I found the main character, Rachel, to be really pathetic and, quite frankly, kind of weird. I did not have any sympathy for her at all. Please, don't waste your time reading this book. I don't know why it got so many great reviews."
"282",281,"Beth Hartnett","As you can tell from the one star, I did not enjoy this book at all. I didn't like a single character in the novel and was looking forward to the end."
"283",282,"Adam Floridia","Three terrible narrators each with the same exact voice and penchant for none-to-smoothly dropping in backstory. Blah!"

"285",284,"Maxi","Boring had trouble sticking with it. Improbable characters. "
"286",285,"Elizabeth McPike","Not one of my favorite reads. "
"287",286,"Aiden W","Daily Mail bumper book of baddies. With this book you get hooked up to an drip of stereotypical middle class characters and anxieties. for most of the book we hear from 3 women who between them are unemployed (or just idle), alcoholic, overweight, deceitful, deluded, neurotic due to children, neurotic due to childlessness, manipulative, the celeb magazine list of failings goes on... then in the final third 3 male characters are developed, who unsurprisingly turn out to be by turns paranoid, controlling, mendacious, dangerous, violent. but then this is a murder mystery so why not? All those who read novels while commuting into the city by train will relate to the motif of railway journeys which runs through the book; I think I just expected a bit more."
"288",287,"Jim Steele","I don't understand the commotion over this book. To compare it with Gone Girl is sacrilege! The only thing it has it common is that the reader hates all the characters in each book. Writing about unsavory characters creates a very fine line. Where Gillian Flynn walks this line and creates a fascinating book, Paula Hawkins creates characters I quit caring about within 100 pages. The protagonist is an alcoholic who stalks the husband of a murder victim. She has a small piece of evidence related to the crime and tries to turn this small observation into the very heart of the investigation. Don't waste your time or money."
"289",288,"Maria Ines Alvarez","yeah....no.not the book for me"
"290",289,"Gaurav","A weak attempt at thriller writing. The story wasn't gripping enough. Wonder how it managed to stay in the New York Times bestseller list for such a long period. (Last time I checked, it was running at the tenth place in the list after being there for 39 weeks). Seems totally absurd to me."
"291",290,"Kerry","Let me start by saying that, in general, I'm really tired of the 'crazy' girl genre that's so popular right now. It seems every 'must read' book is a mystery that's driven by a woman's mental instability. So you can probably guess that I hated this book. And it's probably the worst of the worst. Spoilers!!! The narrative simply exploits the awfulness of each of these three women to drive a mystery that I worked out not long after Megan went missing. Had the mystery been a surprise or something earth-shattering, I could be more forgiving of this story. Finding out that Racheal was a victim of gas-lighting by Tom, attempting to redeem her, simply didn't have any weight into it for me. He clearly was cruel from the beginning and Racheal had done some awful stuff that wasn't a lie perpetuated by Tom; her insulting clients, her taking the baby, and her awful emails. Anna... well, I don't even know where to begin with the portrayal of her. It felt like a very stilted attempt to dig deep into a certain type of woman, but the execution simply came across as a revenge character.Even the female cop was loathsome. And this is where I felt the narrative failed. It built this universe of women that were codependents at best and hateful, spiteful, with a severe lack of empathy at worse and then suddenly at the end tried to throw Tom at me and say ""HERE'S THE REAL AWFUL PERSON!'"" It did not work for me. At all."
"292",291,"Manjunath","waste of time. spent a lifetime expecting something better. ended as it started - pale"
"293",292,"jeab1981","A weak story about a few one-dimensional (bordering on pathetic) women whose self-worth comes entirely from men. "
"294",293,"Jodi","I gave it a chance, but this book is definitely not for me. Terrible writing. If I'm not interested within the first 20 pages it's a waste of time. There are too many other good books.Thanks to some of the readers that gave an honest review and summed it all up so that I know what the whole thing was about and how it ended without the drudgery of having to read it."
"296",295,"Greg Courtney","Pretty lame. I felt as if I had to read this book after all the hype I had been hearing from the media and reviews. How could five people living in such close proximity be such a bunch of losers. None of the characters has any redeeming value. What a waste of my time. Actually figured this one about a quarter of the way through. Glad I didn't buy it."
"297",296,"CJ","This novel just did not live up to the hype. I feel like Hawkins was trying to hard to make it the next Gone Girl, and she just did not succeed. The style and mystery is similar to a Gillian Flynn novel, but Flynn's novels are far superior to this one. I figured out the murderer/twist before I was even halfway through the book. There isn't a single likable character in the book - all the women are weak and sad, and the men are manipulative and abusive. Everyone seems like some sort of stereotype. The women are also indistinguishable from eachother - there are three female narrators and their voices are almost identical, to the point that I had to keep reminding myself which chapter I was reading. It's a quick read, so those curious won't waste a lot of time on it, fortunately. But it you're looking for a good mystery, stick to Flynn or Tana French."
"298",297,"Cait","STOP COMPARING THIS BOOK TO GONE GIRL. STOP.I can see the obvious reasons to compare. Girl goes missing, no one knows why, people suspect the husband, etc etc etc.The biggest problem I have with this book is how two dimensional the characters are. I honestly didn't sympathize with any of them. Obviously everyone has faults, but I like to believe that most of the world goes on trying to better themselves and move on. Or, if you're a particularly evil person, you embellish your faults and work towards being more evil.Everyone in this book started out as a jerk, and everyone finished this book as a jerk. There was zero character development. It's not that they were jerks, it's that they maintained their jerkiness throughout. When I read Gone Girl, I was impressed with the layers and layers of personality that Amy had. I loved that writing. But in The Girl on the Train, there was none of that. The characters were all flat, and it lead to very boring reading. Rachel would go on about ""Oh, I rode the train here, and I talked to this person"", etc for chapters and chapters, and while that was supposed to be thrilling, it really wasn't because of the lack of character development.So stop comparing it to Gone Girl, an actual suspenseful read with plenty of dynamic characters."
"299",298,"Lectito","I wasn’t going to review The Girl on the Train. Pointing out the myriad problems with poorly written pulp fiction is akin to shooting fish in a barrel and makes me sound like a pompous git with a giant bookmark up my arse to boot. Books like this are written to provide a few minutes’ escape on the train to work, to make a long flight pass more quickly, to distract troubled minds, to offer fantasies when our own imaginations fail. The whole point is to switch your brain off. Don’t take it too seriously. Just relax. I get it. And I thought, fuck it. Big international bestsellers like The Girl on the Train are exactly the type of books we should—must—make the subject of scrutiny because, whether we like it or not, these books have influence. And I gotta tell you, the problems I have with this book go way beyond lazy plotting and clunky dialogue. Read my full review."
"300",299,"Kristjana","Takes long to start and get ""interesting"". Highly overrated. Simple, boring, predictable."
"301",300,"Linda Bechtold","UGH!! I will give it one star because it was a quick read. There wasn't a likable character in the whole book, I saw where it was going from the start, and a huge mistake in the writing. Need to find a good book to read now to make up for this."
"302",301,"Eryn Paull","90% of this book was 5stars, at least.Who finishes a book so clunkily, so poorly, so grossly-underwritten that it deserves less than 1star overall?!!!?

"303",302,"Ulli","Utterly annoying."
"304",303,"Alexandra","I was looking forward to loving this book, but it just wasn't my cup of tea. It's very difficult reading a book where you aren't fond with any of the characters. Also the plot was appealing, I like mysterious but this book was predictable from beginning to end. "
"305",304,"Fabian Neidhardt","Girl on the Train soll ein Thriller sein. Rachel pendelt jeden Morgen mit dem Zug aus den Vororten nach London und fantasiert sich die Leben der Leute in den an den Gleisstrecken liegenden Häusern zusammen. Gerne betrachtet sie besonders ein Pärchen – sie nennt sie Jess und Jason – , dessen Haus sie jeden Morgen sieht. Eines Tages erfährt sie, dass Jess verschwunden ist und sie beschließt, bei der Suche zu helfen.Etwas ähnliches steht auch in der Inhaltsangabe. Hätte etwas werden können, wurde es für mich aber nicht. Weil zu viele Sachen unsauber sind. Die Geschichte wird aus der abwechselnden Ich-Perspektive von drei Frauen erzählt, um die sich die Geschichte spannt, unter anderem Rachel und „Jess“. Damit das aber funktioniert, musste Rachel Hawkins Zeitsprünge einbauen, wie sollte Jess sonst erzählen können, wenn sie verschwunden ist? Was bedeutet, dass man im Lesefluss ständig unterbrochen wird, weil man zum Anfang des vorherigen Kapitels blättern muss, um zu sehen, ob wir uns am gleichen Tag, ein Jahr früher oder sonst wo befindet.Dazu kommt, dass die Protagonistin eine mir unglaublich unsympathische Person ist, und noch dazu Alkoholikerin und die Geschichte nur deshalb funktioniert, weil sie einen Blackout hat, sich nicht mehr an gewisse Dinge erinnern kann. Und das hält sich den gesamten Roman über, bis sie – oh Wunder – am Ende die Klarheit erlangt und sich erinnert und die Lösung der Geschichte hat. Klassischer Fall von Deus Ex Machina. Leider wird das beim lesen recht schnell klar, also liest man auf den Augenblick hin, in dem sie sich erinnert.Dann kommt dazu, dass die drei Ich-Perspektiven unsauber sind. Klar, sie führen dem Leser ganz eindeutig vor Augen, dass die Leben der Anderen nie so glamourös sind, wie wir es uns vorstellen. Aber wenn da nicht jedesmal der Name der Person drüber stehen würde, müsste man relativ lange lesen, bis man weiß, wer da gerade erzählt. Alle drei Frauen haben die gleiche Art der Sprache und sind, soweit wir sie kennenlernen, auch in ihrem Verhalten und ihren Gedanken sehr ähnlich. Da mir schon die erste nicht sympathisch war, wurden mir die anderen beiden das auch nicht. Also schleppt sich die Geschichte von einem Selbstmitleidsmonolog zum nächsten, bis dann endlich die Erinnerung und das Ende kommt.Eine letzte Sache, die aber nicht an der Story, sondern an der Vermarktung liegt. Der Untertitel im Deutschen, der aus englischen Übernommen wurde, lautet:Du kennst sie nicht, aber sie kennt dich.Das ist die Ironie schlechthin, denn das ist das Einzige, das wir aus dem Buch lernen: Dass die Personen, die wir sehen, nie das Leben haben, dass wir uns vorstellen. Dass wir sie alles andere als kennen. Wer kam auf die Idee, diesen Roman damit zu bewerben? Das grenzt an bewusster Irreführung und hat nichts auf dem Cover zu suchen.Ich habe Girl on the Train gelesen, um das hier schreiben zu können, aber ich kann es keinem empfehlen. Lest, aber lest was anderes.Girl on the Train von Paula Hawkins wurde übersetzt von Christoph Göhler und erschien bei Blanvalet. Das Rezensionsexemplar wurde mir vom Verlag zur Verfügung gestellt."
"306",305,"Michelle Boutte","Boring and a total letdown. I was expecting so much more from all of the hype. I couldn't wait to read it and now I'm kinda bummed that I did. The book had potential but it feels as though the ending was thrown together. It was kind of a sh**show. "
"308",307,"Olivia Judd","Thoroughly underwhelmed. If you liked Gone Girl (I didn't) then you might enjoy this, but it wasn't particularly well written, the characters were annoying, and there were no twists. All quite predictable."
"309",308,"Elin","The whole book and the first few chapters are super depressing Once I ignored the depressingness and got involved in the mystery it was better, the pace was good. But my overriding memory of this book is how unceasingly depressing it was to read - there is simply no way I'd recommend anyone else to read it. "
"311",310,"Angie Romano","This may be the worst book I have actually ever finished reading. I feel like I am now dumber for reading it. How is this compared to Gone Girl? At least in Gone Girl someone was diabolical. This book was predictable, boring, and just sad. The story was drawn out way too long and really didn't seem to completely connect. Are we really supposed to believe that people would actually let some idiot guy lie to them for about everything and bring 2 women to such lows that they wouldn't believe themselves or their own memories? Don't waste your time reading this book. "
"313",312,"Joanne Seitz"," Too many people to too many things that are not believable, at least that's what I got out of it. I don't understand the hype, although maybe it's another 'Girl' title so that might sell?"
"314",313,"Chelsea Holt","I was excited to read this book because of all the hype and press around it being the ""next Gone Girl."" However, I was very disappointed. I saw the twist coming a mile away and ALL of the characters were unsympathetic. I get having an evil character - look at Gone Girl - but at least you empathize with them at some point during the story. In Girl on the Train you really dislike every character. I couldn't wait for it to end and probably would've put it down (which I never do), had I not been reading it for Book Club. Some of my book club members thought it still passes for an ""easy, quick beach read."" I disagree as I think there are great writers that write books that qualify as ""beach reads"" such as LIanne Moriarty or Gillian Flynn or Kate Atkinson."

"323",322,"Jacqueline","Hated everything about this book. The characters, the storyline, everything. I don't know why it's touted as being so ""intense and gripping""- I frankly found it pretty dull and boring. I should have guessed when it was suggested for people who liked Gone Girl, since I think I liked that even less than this."
"324",323,"Nageen","Literary merit: 2 starsLet me begin by saying that after years of book reading/nerding/book plot predicting/keeping up with the book lovers company experience, I have now understood what book appeals to whom and this one is for the people who read stories about men and women and relationships and Judi Piccoult and Jude Devereaux and Judith McNaughht and Mills and Boons romances and my son bullies kids at school stories and that boy had an abusive childhood stories and Danielle Steel and perhaps a bit of Sidney Sheldon, well you get the idea.No offense to those readers, I have done my fair share of reading Sheldon too, but this book is a plot driven, a rather badly written, confusing hot mess where three people and three more people are involved in each other's lives through the sheer motivation of sex, cheating and one murder to rule them all!!I think I was gonna be the one getting sick of reading each Morning or Evening entry with ""I did not sleep"", ""I woke up shaking"", ""I drank too much and now I am gonna be sick"", ""My knees are trembling"" sentences, God, can we just tell Hawkins that we get the idea that Rachel is bloody drunk and unstable on her feet all the time?Right after reading this I developed the feeling that this book had the same potential in its plot as Gone Girl, however Gillian Flynn did a hell of a job with that book so did the writers and the directors with the movie, but this was merely a waste. Turns out publishers have been portraying this as the next Gone Girl, well that is a huge lie (read misinterpretation) they are selling out. Also, the blurb tells you that she saw something shocking and enough to change the lives of the people around her, let me tell you that after the recent misguiding blurb of ""The Night Circus"" and now this one, I have developed a rather keen eye about how blurbs misguide readers. There is nothing shocking or plot twisting in there she saw. (I am gonna save talking about it as I do not want spoilers in here).Many passages were so over written, it was so boring to read what she saw from the train. Hayee, I skimmed those passages.All in all, the plot Hawkins managed had so much potential, to put so much in there, rather I believe it was just wasted!"
"325",324,"Taryn","What is the hype with this book all about?With mentally unstable supporting characters; and a very self-absorbed, self-harming, alcoholic protagonist, coupled with a couple of very deceptive husbands, this book could have been a LOT better than it actually was. The end was anti-climactic and predictable, and left much to be desired as far as thrillers go. I struggled to get through this and was overcome with relief when I got to the last few pages just to be done with the thing.Much better thriller/mystery novels exist - go read those. "
"326",325,"Karl Debbaut","Cheap thrill, repetitive, confusing, the characters are interchangeable. I just dont get the hype. The last good hype was Stoner. Twenty euros wasted on this rubbish."

The ending was totally predictible and I found the writing style to be annoying the way it jumped back and forth between the characters and time frames."
"333",332,"VV","I like books with unreliable narrators and even with unlikeable characters, but I thought this book was poorly executed and there was not much to enjoy. It seemed like the chapters were written as diary entry-style confessionals, so there was no reason for Megan to be so vague in hers, it just seemed like deliberate stalling tactics. The main twist was so painfully obvious from early on that Rachel's inability to see it was just baffling and frustrating. The female characters were so badly written, it was cringeworthy and frankly astonishing that they were written by a female author. The mystery was weak and the characters were worse. "

I am glad I got it from the library so that I don't need to demand a refund!! This book had so much potential, the storyline should have lead to a wonderful story, but instead it was like watching a bad movie and finally saying enough is enough, I didn't even peek, I don't know what happened and I don't care, that is how bad this book was. In my opinion, poorly written, poorly executed and professionally marketed to be the next big thing..it is not!"

"344",343,"Anna Hakopian","Pre-reading: Let's see what the hype is all about. The holds list for this book is still at 135. I am seeing it everywhere. Ok, finally I have my copy let's start!Now: I hate my life.This book was so predictable and unoriginal, per se. Like while I was reading it, I thought ""Hey this reminds of Gone Girl"" (even though I've never read the book but have seen the movie a thousand times). Also, some of the stuff I was able to predict with no sweat. Halfway into the book I read some GR reviews, and hey they also compared this to Gone Girl and called it predictable. I went into this book blind; I knew nothing about the plot. So what is it about?Literally a girl on the train who spends a good portion of the book stalking people. They make you feel sorry for her. I feel sorry for myself for remembering the characters' names for once. You get to the point in your life where you can't remember at least the main characters name because you've read so many. #readingproblemsMain character is Rachel and her enemy, per se, is Anna. I thought this was a mystery book. Apparently I was horribly wrong. It's a thriller, like Gone Girl. Everyone is pretty despicable in the book. No one has redeeming qualities. I would say it's a lot more similar to Big Little Lies but I actually liked that book despite its flaws. This book doesn't have anything for me to enjoy it. Overall I was annoyed by it, but I didn't hate it. Of course mysteries always draw me in because I want to know at least what happened since I already read that far into it. But I said it was predictable. Well yea but I still like it when everything is summed up into a monologue. Or when Morgan Freeman comes in to explain everything that's going on. "

I hate Rachel's drunken stalkerish fanatical obsession to her ex and this couple she doesn't even know.I hate Megan's vagueness and her whiny restless behavior.I hate Scott and his lack of substance and backbone.I hate Tom and his cheating pettiness.I hate Anna and her wife-stealing ""I'm such a wonderful person"" contradiction.The investigators all appear to be crappy people as well.Not only were none of the characters worth getting to know, the story starts out with no information or background, and continues on and on with vague hints on the characters behavior and personalities that just makes you dislike them more and care even less for them. Megan, my dear, just stay missing. Scott, crumble, you seem to be good at it. Tom, Anna- good luck, though neither of you will ever be able to trust one another- you're both cheaters that don't care about ruining a marriage to get what you want. Drink your heart out Rachel, try not to drunk call the investigators next. "

"353",352,"Francesca Tuccella","La narrazione scorre senza problemi, tanto che si riesce a leggere metà libro senza nemmeno accorgersene.Per tutto il resto: noia e banalità,soprattutto il finale.E i personaggi? Uno peggio dell'altro."
"354",353,"Eunice","At first, I thought this book was such a brilliant idea. One dissapearance, three POV, all of them females. The first one Raxhel a troubled person that has not overcomed her divorce from Tom, whom now lives in the old house they used to live with Anna (2nd POV) and her new daughter. Rachel developed a serious alcoholic problem and on top of that has becomed obsessed with Anna and Tom's neighbors. One day it turns out, Megan, the object of Rachel's obsession dissapears, and Rachel wakes up to the news of her dissapearance unable to recollect the night before due to one of her alcoholic blackouts, but sure that she got off the train in the station near to her house. The idea seems nice, but the execution is poor. All the characters are annoying, unidimensional and frankly quite stupid. There are no real development of these stories and although the resolution of the story is VERY OBVIOUS, it is also so weak and doesn't have a real effect because the lack of empathy with the characters. cliffhangers at the end of the chapters are painful to read... They are supposed to be there to plant a seed of doubt but they are so obvious! Some people have said this is equal to .gone girl and I feel offended by it. There is no craft in this book as gone girl, no moral dilemma, no nothing... "
"355",354,"Beccy Noall","I couldn't wait to finish this book, not because it was gripping, but because I didn't like it at all. The concept was good, but I don't think the author capitalised on that. I didn't like or connect with any of the characters; the mystery didn't feel like a mystery; it was very slow moving and I was bored the whole way through. In conclusion, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, and it won't be sitting on my bookshelf next to my Agatha Christies. Unfortunately, I think even a rating of one star is too much. Just my opinion though :) "

"361",360,"Desiree Koh","There are a ton of great books written about murders being committed on trains or at least, plotted on a train. This is not one of them. I'm hard-pressed to spend any more time on this, because it doesn't deserve any more attention. It's banal, bogus, pedestrian, and has no platform, other than the fact that it's a one-dimensional Gone Girl wannabe that needs to be gone, girl. The writing is lazy, I guessed the ""twist"" 60 pages out - it's as predictable as a Japanese bullet train schedule - and not a single character is endearing or someone to donate sympathy to. Reading it felt like being on the train to Lhasa - you are nauseous by the utter lack of craft and skill by the author, and there is nothing else enjoyable about the ride or to alleviate the boredom, yet you stay on because you're curious about what awaits at the end. The only salvation is that thankfully, this is a one-way ticket."
"363",362,"Lauren Henderson","Here we have proof of why I stay away from super-hyped books...Original Review: This is the story of a bunch of batshit crazy, selfish, whiny, weak women with interchangeable voices that you just really don't like at all by the end. I will admit that I read this very quickly because I wanted to find out who the killer was, but I was able to guess that pretty early on. So then it just turned into me wanting to know if I was right. I WAS!!!! I can't say I hated this book, but I can say that there's really not much I liked about it. The timeline is insanely confusing, the characters are all blah - I mean I don't have a problem with liking characters whose actions/motives I don't agree with, but everyone in this book is just extremely annoying. A couple days later after further contemplation: Last night, I explained this book in detail to my husband, and saying everything out loud made me realize how bad this book really is and how much I truly hated this book... so I take it back. I do hate this book. I honestly don't give one star ratings often. I have to really passionately dislike a book.. it's like that.This book is so convoluted, and in general none of the characters are likeable or well developed, not even the men. Also, there are some plot holes.. or maybe just holes in Rachel's crazy thinking. Like how she always saw a sinister smile on everyone's face, and the story never followed through with why that was. Because obviously all of the suspects aren't the killer, so what was it that she saw in them?"

As for the ending it left me as a reader feeling lied too. Paula Hawkins tried to create a ""twist"", however the character chapters are predominately personal from the prospected of that partiuclar character, so once the ""twist"" was revealed it just felt wrong. The narrative in relation to other events didn't seem plausible. A writer can manipulate their reader of course, but I just felt lied to for the sake of trying to create a twist. Am I the only person to think this?!?"

"369",368,"Claudia","I am definitely in the minority in not enjoying this book. I think about 90% of the people in my book club gave it 4 or 5 stars. But for me, it's hard to like a book when I can't stand any of the characters. Rachel is an alcoholic and I tried to be sympathetic to her but she made one stupid decision after another, even when she wasn't drinking. Pretty much everyone else in the book is a terrible person. I love mysteries and read a lot of them, and this one did not keep me guessing. It was pretty clear to me early on who done it and that takes the fun out of reading. I also thought the ending was pretty standard thriller material. "
"370",369,"Michele","Did not like it - couldn't get past the first 50 pages - quit because I didn't like the style of writing and just couldn't connected to the story.

(regardless of the fact that she's a drunk) i feel like her story at least arcs a bit. the anna character is even worse. sadly, she's believable as an actual person - just not the kind of person you'd want to know. the author portrays both rachel & anna as these delusional women who are nothing without their man. (who happens to be the same person, and don't even get me started on him) i can't believe anna's reactions to some of the things she finds out...honestly. i can safely say that i won't be recommending this book to anyone. at the end, it just left me feeling frustrated, a little angry and very disappointed. "
"372",371,"Alissa","Honestly, this book was so disappointing, I have no idea how it got this hyped up. As someone who quite enjoyed ""Gone Girl"" (and other psychological thriller/mystery/unreliable narration type books), I figured this would be right up my alley. I was so, so wrong.The author's writing style was plain at best; sloppy and repetitive at worst. The five main characters were barely developed and barely distinguishable from one another. They all lied and cheated over and over again and I quickly stopped caring. None of them were remotely likeable, relatable, or even close to realistic. The plot itself just ran in circles until I was bored and frustrated as hell. I forced myself to finish it just to see if it would surprise me and redeem itself. The ""big twist"" was hardly a twist at all, and I closed it feeling like I wasted my time. Save yourself the trouble - skip this read! "
"373",372,"Michela","Sul serio? E questo sarebbe il best-seller che sta vendendo milioni di copie in tutto il mondo? Davvero non capisco. L'ho acquistato per curiosità, a volte ci casco ancora in questi trappoloni editoriali. Ma ce l'avete una coscienza letteraria? Io la mia non so come smacchiarla dopo aver letto questo libro. Proverò a fare una seduta spiritica, e chissà qualche grande autore del passato proverà compassione per me e mi darà qualche scappellotto, guarendomi definitivamente dalla malattia ""oh ecco un best seller, devo averlo!"". Libro angosciante ma, soprattutto, prevedibile. Ho capito chi fosse il colpevole a metà racconto. Scrivere un giallo/thriller non è semplice.

"375",374,"Steven","I'm not sure I've ever written anything on Goodreads.com, but I hated this book so much, I felt compelled to speak out. I listened to this novel in my car on a trip and it made me want to kill myself. The story revolves around three damaged women and how their lives intersect around the murder of one of the women. The main character, Rachel, is probably the most irritating. She's an alcoholic and relatively self-loathing. I get that, and that's certainly a valid set of characteristics for someone in a novel. But it didn't feel like the author had much to say about her situation. You can tell because we were forced to listen to her say the same damn things and go through the same self-loathing rant over and over again. Basically, if I were a woman, I'd be offended by this novel. Not because all the women were so damaged. People are damaged every day by all sorts of circumstances. But because all the female characters were so damn stupid! I'm hard pressed to think of a group of women who would do as many unrealistically ridiculous things. To say I groaned through this novel is putting it mildly."

"377",376,"Tim Jin","Ever since ""Gone Girl"" there has been a surge of books with the word ""Girl"" in their titles. They all tries to mimic the best seller from Gillian Flynn. I don't like when I'm reading the synopsis of a book that they keep referring to another book from a different author. They are trying to ride on the coat tails from other authors' success. ""The Girl on the Train"" was very disappointing to me and I found it to be sluggish from the first word to its last. Base on my friends' recommendations, it wasn't a page turner for me. I found that the main character to not be intriguing at all and if I really wanted to listen to a drunk, divorce, middle age women (or men), I can entertain myself by going to weekly meetings at my local chapter. Maybe I miss Amy in ""Gone Girl"", but Rachel in ""The Girl on the Train"" wasn't so much of a mystery in my ears. It lacks in that psycho thriller that keeps you guessing at every page. I found the pace of the storytelling to be so slow. It barely held up to my attention. I did not care what happens next and how it ended. I just wanted to get to the end and move onto my next read.I really don't understand what is all the hoopla about over this book. I bought this book because of my friends and Audible kept showing the cover on their front page. Many of my friends has told me that they finish this book in a matter of days, so I was excited to start on it, but after the first few hours, I needed to force myself to listen.I really hope that the publishers will stop referring to Gillian Flynn's work, just because other authors' has a female character. It's getting really annoying and unnecessary. "

I was thinking that something hailed as original and thought-provoking by reviewers was  so boring  and filled with typical character profiles (a blonde, a messy and depressed alcoholic, a cheating man, a handsome therapist, a younger woman that was the other half of the cheating tango, etc.). I realized I kept longingly looking over at my stack of other books. I was trying to get through this one because it is due back to the library, but I just can't. Sorry, but I think this book is a trainwreck *shrugs* and it kinda plays on mental illnesses in the worst ways... Onward to some fantasy. *smiles and rubs palms together*"

I found no enjoyment in reading about her crazed conclusions or her obsessions with everything. Although highly incompetent, she kept trying to help...

"383",382,"Krishna Shah","Seriously, compared to Gone girl. You have to have characters that are at least somewhat likeable. I could not stand any of the characters who were so messed up I couldn't root for any of them. I got halfway through the book and then went to the end to confirm who I thought was the killer. Sorry not Gone girl. I've noticed a lot of authors make the characters deeply flawed. That doesn't make for an interesting story unless there is something in them that allows us to like them a little. "

"400",399,"Alix","New ""it book"" or not, I absolutely, utterly abhorred this novel.To be fair, a large part of that may be because, right from the beginning, I was having hideous flashbacks to the oh-so-fun time I had trying to slog through the drivel that was Gone Girl. But the more I read on, the more legitimate my reasons for drawing those parallels became...Case in point? This book has an entire cast of asshole characters. Maybe it's just me, but I personally find it very hard to muster up interest for a novel when there isn't a single character - even in passing - who isn't a complete and utter dick. I can't cheer for jerks. I can't care for jerks. I can't identify with jerks. I can't feel sorry for jerks (especially when every move they make is in validation of their oh, woe is me circumstances). I hate jerks.Then there's the whole unreliable narrator thing, which I'm not even going to get into (because I will end up literally sitting here typing all the livelong day). But suffice it to say, every viewpoint in this book - every. single. one - was the extreme definition of unreliable narrator. But it didn't work for me. My mind wasn't reeling with the ""what's the truth and what's a lie?"" mystery. I just didn't care. And I didn't care because all of the unreliable narrators in this book were... jerks. Self-serving, egotistical, downtrodden, and actually batshit crazy. But still just jerks.And then there's the story itself. To be frank, it just wasn't strong enough to keep my attention. Not one bit. The foreshadow - when employed - required not an ounce of brainpower to see straight through to the very end. And the ultimate baddie? Well, I had him/her/it (I won't spoil it for you by narrowing it down) pegged within one chapter of his/her/its introduction. So... yay.So while the premise going in sounded awesome, the execution was just bad. Overall? A waste of time. My time, anyway. Hated it."
"401",400,"Maanasa","EDITED REVIEW - I felt worse about having read this book after I slept on it.Pretty standard whodunit. It's a bleak novel, and the five main characters are all deeply flawed and unlikeable. I have never disliked a book merely because I wasn't a fan of the lead characters (See, e.g. Gone Girl) as long as I find other fascinating elements to appreciate, but this book doesn't really give me much to love even besides the characters. The prose is extremely functional (and not in a good Isaac Asimov way), the plot and the big reveal are not exactly charting new territory (adultery, alcoholism, domestic abuse, suburban housewife ennui), and the characters never really rise above the level of caricatures. I found myself wondering why this book has been garnering such positive reviews.This is the book equivalent of a Lifetime movie, and the comparisons being made to Hitchcock's Rear Window are completely uncalled for except in the most basic of ways (someone saw something related to a crime through a window). Similarly, this book is absolutely not on the same level as Gone Girl, which is stylistically far superior to and far more cleverly plotted than The Girl on the Train. Overall, I regret having wasted my time on such an insipid mystery novel."
"403",402,"Lauren Ravida","Most overrated book in existence. Reads as if it was a creative writing assignment for a year 9."
"405",404,"Eileen Higgins","Hoping for more, I felt disappointed. I was intrigued at first with the interesting addition of the train as the setting for the author's point of view. As Rachel physically revisits her past life each day on her daily round trip to London, she evaluates and reimagines how she could have changed her past. She creates new characters that would surround her in that fresh life and is shocked out of her stupor when she finds that the lives of her imaginary friends are just as difficult as hers. The book's characters, both real and imagined, fell flat in their caricatures of barrenness, depression, alcoholism, infidelity, jealousy, and murderer. Without believable backstories, it was impossible for their actions and this story to feel true. The author coupled these shadow characters with a story line that was predictable from the get-go. The ""good"" guy always turns out to be the bad guy, and sure enough he was. He just wasn’t bad enough to make me believe anything about this story. "
"407",406,"Jason Sam","One of the worst book I've read . The characters were uninteresting and the plot was too predictable. "

Next time I will read the valuable reviews by other ""Goodreader"""
"411",410,"The Book Slayer","Delivering a huge dose of uninspired writing and a muddled plot, this book manages to be the most frustrating reading experience of the year. It's not an intriguing story, and almost immediately gives you the impression it could've been done heaps better. The book didn't live up to my expectations. All of it was unconvincing without any humour, with stuff that was either underdeveloped or just came out of nowhere without establishing the ideas properly.Rachel Watson catches a peak-hour train to London every day, always stopping in front of some houses while the signal changes. During this slight wait, she observes a particular couple named Scott and Megan Hipswell. At one point, on one train ride, Rachel observes Megan kissing another man. Then Megan goes missing, and maybe, just maybe, Rachel knows what happened.All of this is pretty farfetched, because Rachel is an alcoholic with memory problems, she's dumb and overweight, and she gets embroiled in this murder-mystery? Yeah right. It seems this author is just making this crap up as she goes along. Rachel's motivation to get involved is weak. Add to that the fact that her ex-husband conveniently lives down the road from Scott and Megan Hipswell. Yeah right.It's not good storytelling. It's cheap and it obviously lacked planning. If this was more blatantly a farce, I'd accept the unbelievable stuff, but you can tell this author lifted ideas from 'Gone Girl', 'Before I Go To Sleep' and 'The Silent Wife'. Just this poor imitation, this hodgepodge without any of its own ideas. Not once does Rachel have something memorable to say about life. She's the epitome of an unreliable narrator - so obviously drawn, with her memory problems. She's not likeable, she's not fascinating.The biggest problem is that there are three female narrators, all in first person POV, and they switch as a new chapter starts. Their names are Anna, Megan, and of course, Rachel. The flaw is, their voices are interchangeable, you can't tell them apart. You don't get to know them enough to differentiate between them, and a lot of their thoughts and actions are passive. It's just a stupid idea to have these three identical characters.Another problem that continually bugged me was the completely pointless habit the author has changing tense. ""She rides the train, she rode the train."" I'll never understand why authors can't stick to the one tense. It's jarring. It doesn't change things up, it serves no purpose. But of course this is a poorly written book, so I'm not surprised that the author is seemingly clueless when making these decisions.In summary, this is an inept thriller by an inexperienced writer. The reason I called the book frustrating was because the twist is crappy. I got suspicious halfway through, thinking Rachel has a multiple personality disorder (with Megan and Anna being her other personalities). Then there were these references to hypnosis, so maybe a doctor created some extra personalities within Rachel. But no.Towards the end, waiting for the big explosive mindfuck, I began to believe that the three narrators were voices inside a man's head (I believed this because a reviewer connected this book to Hitchcock). But nope. Instead, you get a generic, uninspired twist no sane person would care about. Trust me, it will drive you nuts.So you wait and wait for something amazing, wading through boring prose, unsatisfyingly shallow characterisation and disappointing mystery, with a low level of ideas throughout, and you end up wondering, ""Why is everyone giving this book 4 or 5 stars on goodreads.com?"" The book doesn't drag you along, there are zero effective red herrings to make the story compelling. I just kept asking the author, ""Where the hell are you taking this story?"" Then: ""How did this crap get published?""Enjoyment Factor: 0 starsMovie Potential: 1 star"
"412",411,"Denise MacDonald","I didn't get this book when it came out because of the Gone Girl comparisons. I liked Gone Girl but I haven't liked any book that was released after it that was said to be like it. This one was no different. I read it for two reasons: it was the pick for my book club this month and I found a free copy of it. I didn't like it for many reasons: 1. it was dragged out and boring 2. all of the characters were nasty- there wasn't even one I could root for just a little bit 3. I figured it out before the halfway mark 4. the end was anticlimactic 5. being compared to Gone Girl creates such a high expectation that it would have to be a pretty fantastic book to hit that bar. "
"413",412,"Jaymie","I thought this book was depressing and sad. Not one character was likable. As for the mystery part I kind of felt I knew the bad person and it wasn't like mystery clues..it was a drunk persons hazy memories. Kinda just made me feel blah and ick. I really didn't like ""Gone girl"" either and this made me feel the same way. Lots of F words and just sad pitiful characters. Not my thing! The part I did find interesting was the way she viewed peoples lives and how wrong she was. I think at times we have all done that. "

"418",417,"JBLG","I hated this book! It reminded me very much of Gone Girl, but that book was fast paced and really interesting. This mystery was only ok and it was very slow moving. The characters were ALL dishonest liars with broken lives. Is this what the author truly thinks of humanity? Everyone in London and the surrounding areas is a misfit? The book was very dark and depressing and there was no redemption. I would not recommend this book to anyone and told my reading friends to take it off their list."
"419",418,"Krista","I was pretty disappointed in this book. Considering it's been so popular I had high expectations. It moves at a snails pace and the main character was so pathetic and annoying I wanted her to disappear. Plus, it's not much of a thriller if you can guess right away who did it. I say skip it."
"420",419,"Sonya","Tediously predictable plot; tediously unappealing characters. I finished it though, because, like the ""girl"" in the title, I was on a train. She wasn't a girl by the way, she was a woman in her thirties. "
"421",420,"Zöe Yu","Obviously I cannot like this book. The pace is not right for me. From the beginning to until the mid of the book, I was confused with all kinds of names, and 98% of the book is in a drunk and not clear way of looking at things. First, it's fine to ""listen"" to an alcoholic wrecked woman talking about her doubts, but gradually it felt like boring. And the boring pace goes on and on. People say the first draft would be like talking to yourself, and I would venture to say this is the case. It felt also like diary, but the style and structure of the book is a disaster. Last 2%of the book when everything comes to a clear mind, we'd know who is the murderer and we'd catch up with the author's suddenly running pace to know who did what to whom. I felt like a waste of time reading the beginning then. "
"422",421,"Maryann","Very disappointed in this book- especially since it was being compared to Gone Girl- which I really enjoyed! This book reads like teeth being pulled and it's painful- I was patient and kept waiting for it to get better but it never did- waste of money and time!"
"423",422,"Linda Holway","did not like, story was not enjoyable..."
"425",424,"Shawn","No. I did not like it. I don't understand why so many told me to read it. "
"426",425,"Emma Duncan","I usually can't be bothered trying to figure out who dunnit - I just have to keep reading and l'll get the answer. So you know it's a really bad who dunnit when even my lazy brain can see who it is before the end. Plus the women are all so pathetic. Do not bother with this book."
"427",426,"Hanz","snore"
"428",427,"Alexandria Fabbro","Book club choice, otherwise I'd avoid this book like the plague. It's an easy read, at least, largely due to the lack of any challenging vocabulary (although I was reminded about ""kerb"" midway through the book). Underdeveloped characters, no one you'd want to associate with (the detectives are OK, I guess), weak women defined by men/their love of a man/their desire to conceive. Shallow, vapid, and sadly stereotypical chicas (the men are all so computer savvy, while the women can't figure out how to clear their browsers, or if they have managed to figure it out, they forget to actually do so).There is no mystery or thrill, just annoyance.Just why is this book so popular?"
"429",428,"Sergiy Svitlooky","I picked this one only because it was hot listed by goodreads... From now on I should be more careful with that. What a waste of time and effort it turned out to be. Lazily constructed narration in the form of diary looks like a mean to make a reader feel pity for Rachel. Otherwise, no one would get why she is so miserable and useless. Apparently, this doesn't help. Rachel is a top of all useless and messed up characters in this book whom I don't want to know nothing about if met in real life. If you just cut off all the emotional paroxysms, all the useless words that don't give nothing to plot development, the novel would probably turn into a small story. As the plot progressed I really hoped there would be finally a good suspense, but all I got was just a wining by Rachel and the chain of irritating actions made by her. On the top of that all, we just have bunch of stupid girls whose problems, in the author's opinion are coming from horrible men that surround them. Feminism, seriously all this mess is just to prompt these ideas??? "

"435",434,"Ellen Cannon","The book is soft trash. The characters are crazy. The plot is fast and tedious at the same time; but good enough for me to finish the book to find out what happens. If I want to try and be philosophical about the book, I'd say it's about wounded hearts left to themselves. "
"436",435,"Tony","Wow, this is a terrible book... It reads like someone deliberately set out to try and do a Rear Window/Gone Girl mashup with an overlay of convenient amnesia. In a nutshell, the story is about an alcoholic who commutes into London every day and imagines the lives of a couple she sees from the window of the train -- who also happens to live on the street the alcoholic woman lived on with her ex-husband. When the woman disappears, the alcoholic thinks she might have remembered seeing something. From that point on, it's one of those stories that is built around an unreliable narrator who might or might not have the key to the mystery thanks to her blackouts. Which might barely be forgivable if any of the characters were actually interesting or had depth -- but they don't. To be sure, there are plenty of books where key information is withheld from the reader in the interest of a gripping story, but this one is just clunky and bad."
"437",436,"Candelaria","Hated it, couldn't finish, she was so annoying, drunk blacking out all the time, made for a boring read."
"439",438,"Jessie","This book was mildly interesting at best. It chronicles the story of a drunk. The author's description of how it physically feels to need alcohol, yet be so ill from it made me nauseas. Not a great way to spend the first half of a book. There were a few unexpected plot twists, but every single character in the book (except for the main character's poor roommate) was emotionally unstable. You know what happens when you repeatedly put yourself in a bad situation? Bad things happen. Hence: this book."
"440",439,"Rona","I could not read this book because I hated the main character so much. Only got through 2 chapters and quit."

"445",444,"Andrew","Disappointed and frustrated that this ""best seller"" was so desperately bad. Yes, I finished it just to find out who the culprit was, but feel like I slogged through 3/4 of this book in a fog of boredom. I tend not to like books set out like a diary, with different characters relating events that happened to them on specific days, and this added to the tedium. I made no connection with any of the characters, found the plot to be predictable and the ""bad guy"" so obvious about half way through. Could not wait for it to end."
"447",446,"Jenn Cunha","UGH...what a pile of garbage. I don't understand how everyone loved this book. For starters, let's talk about the fact that Megan's story begins a year before Rachel's. After reading so much of Rachel's, it felt natural for the book to continue on the same time line. It was only after ""the incident"" that I realized I hadn't been paying attention to what came first. Secondly...these characters were awful human beings. There is not a single one that I actually cared about and I couldn't care less about how their stories ended. Third. I understand that the one guy wasn't a main character...but he got no closure whatsoever. How do you just tie up the ending in a little bow and pretend it's perfect? Terrible. "
"448",447,"Tammy Kesteloot","Ugh! DNF @ 62% I forced myself to read this one as long as I could but it was VERY boring! The reading is so dry. I guess I just wasn't impressed with chapter after chapter of the alcoholism, or cheating. Both of these women are so depressing and self-sabotaging. It was difficult to read and not get irritated. I am a pretty positive person and I just wanted to grab these woman and talk to them. I wanted to remind them that they are in control of their lives and they could be happy if they wanted to be and chose to be. And then I realized that I didn't connect or really care about any of the characters. The plot had potential but really fell flat and fizzled out. "
"449",448,"Nan Williams","This story starts with a good premise and then quickly goes down hill. There is not one sympathetic character in the entire story - no one to like, no one to cheer on, no one to hope they ""win.""The biggest mystery is why this is a best seller. The second biggest mystery has to do with all the 4 and 5* ratings.Obviously having different chapters being written in the first person by different characters is popular right now and I guess it worked OK in this novel. But what about this trend of having all bad guys? The last several books I've read, all of them highly regarded, don't have any good people in them. In this book I really got tired of reading about drinking binges, hangovers, lovers' trysts, verbal (and later, physical) fights, etc. I could not believe how incredibly stupidly all the characters acted.I did finish this one as it promised a ""Hitchcockian twist"" at the end. Really? No, the ending was pretty lame and predictable.Comparing this to ""Gone Girl""? That's like comparing a lighted match to fireworks! Both involve fire. Period.Don't waste your time on this book. Not worth it."

"452",451,"Tracy","I thought this book was awful. I was excited to read this at first. Then it became a chore to finish it. I kept waiting for a plot twist that never happened. Each of the characters was a complete mess, not one of them was likable."

"457",456,"Lisa Reed","I do not get the hype and glowing reviews for this book.I had a hard time getting into it; 50 or so pages in, I thought I should just close it up and forget it. But the reviews, the praise for it had me thinking, stay with it, it has got to get better. Halfway through, I had invested too much time to quit, so I kept trudging along, bored and not caring about this book at all, just wanting to be done and finished with it. The last 30 pages I skimmed and then mercifully, I was done. And very sorry to have wasted 3 nights of my life on this book. I have no problems turning off a tv show or movie that I can't get into it, I need to learn it is okay to do the same with a book, so only myself to blame for this one!"
"458",457,"Lizzy Taylor","I'll be honest, I picked up this book simply because of the sheer popularity of it. I had read the general premise along with a few reviews and it sounded interesting, so I put a hold on the book at my local library. After waiting a few months for it to become available (like I said, SUPER popular), I finally received my copy and my initial reaction was disappointment. I should have researched this book a little more because the book itself is only 323 pages. Now, I know I shouldn't judge a book based purely on the page count, but let's be honest, the size of the book is often a direct correlation to how trite the story is. I wanted to give it a fair chance though and really wanted to like this book. The truth is, however, that this book is for people who don't read. Or at least people who don't enjoy reading enough to understand what good writing is. Every single person in the book is a caricature... over the top, too expressive, too whiny, too broken, too crazy. Every last one of them. Now, in some books, that works, but these people are supposed to be ""normal"" (with the exception of the killer, of course). Instead, however, every last person that you meet in this book (down to the characters that are only in the story for a few paragraphs) seems to be certifiable, but not in a way that lends itself as beneficial to the story. These people are not realistic and it's simply not believable. I honestly think the author thought she was creating intrigue by making the characters so dramatic, but truly it was just bewildering and annoying. You hate everyone and don't really feel bad for any of them except maybe the dead girl (and even that one is a big maybe). The author tries to dredge up sympathy from the reader, but she has already painted the characters so negatively, it's impossible to feel sorry for them. None of these people seem to contain any true empathy or remorse. I feel like this whole book is just a sociopathic daytime drama. It just doesn't make sense.In addition to that, the story was borderline boring, the main character unlikable (I was almost rooting for her demise in the end), and the storyline was far too convenient. The editing was terrible, there were misspellings and grammatical errors. The foreshadowing was awful (I knew how the story would end by the halfway point in the book) and the writing was just so-so. I finished this book in a matter of hours (literally about 5-6 hours split between 2 days), and for once, I was grateful for a book to be so short. I was just thankful for it to be over."

De hoofdpersoon irriteerde me mateloos; met name haar zelfmedelijden, ik vond de structuur verwarrend en moest telkens terugkijken op welk punt in de chronologie ik zat, de vertaling was op sommige punten beroerd (onderstreept weer mijn geloof dat als je een taal beheerst je het boek in de originele taal moet willen lezen) en het verhaal was matig. Het plot was even spannend, maar niet écht verrassend. Geen aanrader."
"466",465,"Lisa Born","Couldn't even finish. I started this book in October and it's now December. Long story short...I read a summary online and moved on.

"468",467,"Ann Gemmel","Wow this came so highly recommended! What a huge disappointment. The style of writing from various characters perspectives was creative but overall all the characters are so pathetic and overall such a dark story on so many levels! I got sucked in because of people comparing it to Hitchcock and rear window. Not even close! In fact it's an insult to both! We live in such a dark world with so much real life human tragedy - no redemption on any level in this story, just dark and depressing! A big downer waste of time! "
"469",468,"Amy Hamilton","I did not enjoy this book at all, I felt as though it were a slow and painful read for me. Nothing like 'gone girl' at all, the writing did not have me on the edge of my seat and I was not particularly thrilled by the end either. If you are debating on whether or not to read this, I would just give it a miss "
"471",470,"Epicreader","I will confess right up front that I did not finish the book. That is extremely rare for me, so I think it says something that I gave up about half-way through. The idea had so much promise. But, I just could not relate in any way with any of the characters (and admit I found it distracting to shift back and forth between the perspectives of the various main characters). The non-stop stupid decisions and lies, with no reason to lie, of the alcoholic main character (can't even remember her name), exasperated me and I ended up just stopping. Reminded me of Bonfire of the Vanities, one of the only other books that I also did not finish."
"472",471,"Kayleigh","Cliche after cliche! Anyone with an iota of sense will guess the culprit half way through. Over hyped, irritating characters, predictable storyline. "
"473",472,"Tianyu Yu","I couldn't bear the constant dark and gloomy theme with its depressing characters, after I read a couple of chapters. Honestly,everyone has very different personal flavors when it comes to reading, so I guess this is just not the pleasant kind of flavor for me to enjoy. I only decided to read it, because I saw it topped on the best sellers list. Now I just really regret wasting my time on this book. "

"480",479,"Brigitta","This book is depressing. The main characters are brooding, manipulative, and dishonest. The author's writing style is good, otherwise I would've closed the book after the first few chapters.

Don't waste your time, unless you'd like a glimpse of the sorry state of requirements for best selling ""good reads"". "
"481",480,"Tiana Morris","I couldn't get into this book. I understand that it's popular, but I found it predictable and the female characters overwhelmingly disappointing and simple. They were all overly emotional, suffering from what 19th century authors would have referred to as ""nerves"". Someone get these ladies some smelling salts and back bones. "

"485",484,"Lady Knight","I finished this because I needed to understand the hype, but I truly feel like I wasted far too many hours on this book. This book is nothing like Gone Girl despite the many comparisons in the media. The characters here are all terrible people, but without a shred of anything that would make them interesting. I felt no pity nor sorrow for any of them at any point. While the characters of Gone Girl were also reprehensible, they were evilly intelligent and their machinations were captivating despite their terribleness. I finished because I had to, but this is not a book I would ever recommend."
"486",485,"Daaniyah","This book was so disappointing. The plot was so unique and had so much potential so of course I was disappointed when I finished it.It's called the ""girl on the train"" and yet the ending and whole story didn't have much to do with this lady on the train OR what she saw either which was why everyone read it... Wasted idea.The man on the train could and should have played a bigger role! He was brought up so many times, I was really hoping it was the baby's father, or Mac, or maybe both! That would have made an amazing story line. The ending was just plain lazy. "

I had to force myself to read to the end to figure out what actually happened even though I was getting perturbed at all 3 of the female characters for being psycho-hose-beasts. The ending was alright though, if a little contrived. Meh. I don't get how this book got so damn popular. It. Was. BORING. I guess everyone really does love dirty laundry!!

Instead I forced myself to finish it because I did want to know how it ended and I expected it to get better as it went on. Instead it seemed to just drone on and on and on. I could not care about the characters. I felt like there was really a slim plot and it dragged on for too long. I also think it just tied up too tight in the end. This is not a book I can recommend."

"501",500,"Rev","I'm very disappointed. I thought I was in for a thrilling suspense story but I was wrong. A ton of moral postulating. A ton. The author implicitly (or explicitly, depends how you look at it) builds up the characters in such a way that they stand as commentary for the acts that they commit. You'd think that this is what smart writing is all about, but it was done so poorly and only adds fuel to the fire regarding what type of people we're socialized to be. This whole novel panders to already popular ideas about certain human behaviours and the plot is a bit of a mess. I had hopes for this novel seeing as it's a bestseller and was voted one of the best Goodreads novels of 2015. Whomp."

"506",505,"Federica","This book was such a disappointment. Slow, boring and banal... After all the fuss when it first came out, I was expecting something more intriguing. I did like the way Hawkins developed the plot, changing point of view in every chapter but this is, unfortunately, the only positive aspect of this book. The end was so predictable , she got rid of it in just one small chapter but she could have devolped it more, giving the reader a bit of suspance. I haven't read Gone girl yet, but at this point I am not sure it will ever happen. "
"509",508,"Dinakar","Very Boring! Not Worth the hype!I correct myself, it is not boring, it is highsly stereotypical and misogynist in it's outlook of Women. The book wants to show all three of its three female protagonists as spineless and kowtowing. Not worth the read and DEFINITELY not worth being titled a 'Bestseller'!Wish I had not picked it up "
"510",509,"Bruce","Barely finished the first chapter. Like watching grass grow."
"513",512,"Kim Thomason","This is well-written for what it is: a story about dysfunction, loneliness and addiction. It felt pity for the main character, but did not like her. I didn't care for a single character in this entire story. I was relieved when it finally ended. Normally, I wouldn't finish a story that was so distateful to me. Since it got such good reviews I stuck it out. The ending did not reward my persistence. Because of it's devoted following, I can only guess that this is a love-it-or-hate-it work of fiction."
"515",514,"Psiquis","It sucked."
"516",515,"Larry Lindsey","My wife loved this book, but told me it probably ""wasn't my cup of tea."" I should have listened to her. Sixty pages in I had to get off the train. I know it's been on the best seller lists forever-and that given its popularity I'm probably swimming upstream-but I felt it was tedious, depressing, and overly introspective, like a psych 101 textbook. I found the main character self-centered, whiny and repetitive. Those who gave this effort five stars no doubt will call me a loutish male but I just didn't like her. I guess you can't please everybody."
"517",516,"Freesiab","Apparently I'm the only person that thought this book was crap. The only spoiler here is that you will want to murder the characters yourself. It was boring, redundant, predicable and can be read in an hour because it's that basic. There's zero suspense and in the first few pages I had a hunch to the big ""not so big"" twist ending, halfway through I had it pretty wrapped up. This book isn't for readers of authentic thrillers. I would safely categorize this as chick lit. "
"518",517,"James Keim","I had hopes for this book because I enjoy reading unreliable narrators. But, these narrators weren't just unreliable, they were unbelievable and unforgiveable. I was less than halfway through the book, had identified the likely killer and thought ""Well, this should wrap up quickly."" But I had more than half the book still to read! The bigger problems for me as a reader:(view spoiler)[• A narrator who is dead -- I'm not sure to whom her story is being conveyed. It seems especially contrived when she narrates her own murder. Why am I hearing her voice tell me her perspective from beyond the grave.• The broken women and battering husbands theme was handled in way that made it far too cliche. • The unbelievable coincidences that drive the plot.• A red-haired red herring. Come on! (hide spoiler)]"

"522",521,"Dan C.","Plain and simple: I didn't like the book. I really don't understand what the fuss is about. Rachel is not a complex character, she's boring, underdevelopted and least of all a heroine. When I saw that this book was listed as a thriller, I expected suspense and mind blowing ideas; what did I get instead: 399 pages of wanna be detective ideas and 1 page of a very predictable ending. Gone Girl is far more superior and the comparison between these 2 books is disturbing. All in all, it's a waste of literature."
"523",522,"Seanna","I jumped on the hype bandwagon with this one sadly I was disappointed. Despite the high ratings and reviews, I just didn't like this book. The main character was a mess, and at times it just seemed sad and pathetic. The ending was predictable and I just found the characters hard to like. It read quickly but I didn't find myself rushing to read through it to the find out what happens in the end. It was less than ""thrilling"" for me. "

Rachel, la protagonista se mueve en unas coordenadas vitales que no me atraen: vive autoengañándose respecto a su vida y se auto castiga a través del excesivo consumo de alcohol. Sus fantasías son una extensión de la mentira en la que ha convertido su vida. Busco algo muy diferente a la toxicidad de alguien como Rachel, especialmente en el personaje de un libro, con quien establezco cierta intimidad a base de compartir vivencias y de pasar multitud de horas ""juntos"".Al dejar de beber durante los primeros compases de la desaparición de Jess/Megan me he esforzado en continuar unas páginas más. Pero su retorno a los gintonics me ha hecho abandonar definitivamente el libro. "

"530",529,"Travis","This book is AWFUL. I purchased it due to a combination of it winning a Goodreads Best Of 2015 award and me wanting to branch out from fantasy a bit. Good God, was that a mistake. I read about 40% of this book and NOTHING really happened. This book was basically a character study of two pathetic women; the text consisting of them whining about their situations endlessly. So this book won Goodreads Best Of 2015 in Mystery/Thriller. The only mystery in this book is why anyone likes it. The only thrill I got was finally deciding to abandon it and read something worth a damn. "
"531",530,"Aimee","Honestly, this book was so boring that I have absolutely nothing to say about it. "
"533",532,"Violetteanne","I really, really, really did not like this book. I didn't identify with any of the characters, and the ending was rushed and left so many questions unanswered. Not worth reading."
"534",533,"Ailsa"," I did not like this book. At all. I will go so far as to say I hated it. It's not the writing. It is a well written book. My complaint is with the characters. The book is narrated primarily by Rachel, who it quickly becomes clear is an unreliable narrator. Within the first few pages readers realise she's an alcoholic and as the story goes on there are other reveals here and there that show other things that have been omitted, which paint her in a more and more unflattering light. The other two women who narrate are Anna, who is married to Rachel's ex-husband and 'Jess' (actually Megan), the woman Rachel watches from the train.Primarily the narrators annoyed me for their idiocy. The three of them make silly choice after silly choice. In particular I had no sympathy for Rachel, who doesn't seem to be doing anything to help herself. I couldn't care about the characters or what happened to them because they were too idiotic. Rachel drinks and does silly things; Megan makes stupid choices and can't seem to grow up, and Anna sees everything as revolving around her.I forced myself to keep going and I'll admit that I didn't guess how the book was going to end but the characters drove me up the wall. They made it irredeemable in my opinion. I will give this 2/10, based on the fact the writing was actually fine.[This review was first posted on my book blog, link is in my profile.]"
"535",534,"Deborah O","This book is about following an unstable, alcoholic woman around. She is obsessed with her ex-husband (from two years ago) and becomes obsessed with people on her train line home from work. And the whole plot twist, which I won't give away, was very obvious from the beginning of the book, so there wasn't even any surprise factor. This was a book about stupid people behaving stupidly."
"536",535,"Ariel","Clumsy writing, one-dimensional and boring characters, and not really all that thrilling. There was no ""thrill"" in this thriller."
"537",536,"Thiery","Bad, so bad ! The author wanted surfing on the Gillian Flynn book ""Gone Girl"" but it miss his goal !"
"539",538,"Laura Naysmith","Stopped listening to it, I just found it super whiny and annoying. It probably got better, given the rave reviews but if I hadn't stopped when I did I would have been left with a dented wall and a broken phone. "
"540",539,"Anita Willand","I found this to be disappointing, very slow, typical and dull. The storyline was predictable, the characters and their traits/personalities obvious. The only thing I liked was Anna's voice. I found it comical. I found the whole thing to be somewhat 'already been done before'. "
"541",540,"Giselle","Solo hay una palabra que se me ocurre que le queda perfecta al libro: Aburrido.Es lento y no tiene ni un solo personaje interesante. De hecho, todos son insípidos.No miento cuando digo que antes de la página 70 ya sospechaba quién era el asesino, y su motivación para hacerlo. Asi que solo seguí leyendo para saber si tenía razón. Está más allá de mi entendimiento como este libro puede ser calificado con 5 estrellas por algunas personas. "
"542",541,"Edith Bailey","I don't know why this book has gained the popularity it has, but, I'm sorry I wasted my time reading the entire book (which of course i do once I have begun a book, even though it seems awful, just trying to get something out of it!). No redeeming value whatsoever!"
"543",542,"Tammy","I really disliked every character in this story. Couldn't identify with nor care about any of them. "
"546",545,"Amber","This book took to long to get to the point. I was unimpressed by the main characters drama issues and I was bored out of my mind. "
"547",546,"Cathy Smith","One of the most depressing books I've ever read. It made me feel so melancholy reading it. Women who drink too much, shattered by loneliness and caught up in cycles of really unhealthy thinking. Men who are two dimensional and shallow. Let's hope this is one book where the movie version fills out the characters with a bit more intrigue. "
"548",547,"Ben","Really did not like the writer's style. Put me off any further reading."
"549",548,"Catherine Jouet","This book is on the list ""books that are being made into movies in 2016"" which is why I picked it - I love to read books and then see the films. This was also highly recommended by a few friends.I enjoyed it for approximately 1/2 of the book - not great writing and a little too ""thriller"" for me, but I kept turning the pages to see what would happen. Then it became very predictable and was just overdone with the plastic bag evidence (trying not to spoil). At 60%, I stopped reading it. On to the next book."

"552",551,"Claudia Putnam","And the twist was...? If I could give this zero stars, as opposed to the unrated I often give, I would.What a twit fest. -Why is it written in diary format when no one is keeping a diary? Megan even explicitly says she isn't and no one writes a diary in present tense. -Why do people praise it for being well-written when it's riddled with cliche after cliche and they are repeated throughout--flipping stomachs, mouths going dry, hearts battering ribs, on and on and on. Not to mention the broader cliches, like the woman who repeatedly does the thing she knows and says she should not do, and the villain who confesses all at the end, the woman who refers to herself as a girl, etc, and the tropes, such as what Megan's secret turns out to be, women who blame themselves for their infertility, women who see their only roles as being mothers and when that fails have a complete collapse of the imagination as to any other way of defining themselves even in the 20-teens, the sociopath/psychopath whose life is a lie... blah blah.-Why is everything overdescribed, such that Rachel is noticing the swifts as she is trying to dial the police during an absolute emergency when her life is in danger? That's about the most severe case of ADD I've ever heard of.-Why are we subjected to repeated summaries and descriptions of everything we already know whenever a POV shifts or Rachel realizes something anew or tells something she has previously learned to someone else? She immediately repeats, in dialogue, everything she has just said to someone else, or has just told us, the reader, in her pseudo diary, or head-vomit, or whatever it was. She could have just head-vomited to us, ""Scott opened the door, and I told him what I had remembered about Anna."" That's called SPARING THE READER FROM UNENDURABLE BOREDOM. These repetitions are beginning writer mistakes, but even debut writers have critique groups and editors who ought to set them straight. -Why is this book described as a character study when no one here HAS a character? People with characters have ethical frameworks from which they try to operate even when it damages them or causes damage to others. That often leads to tragedy as the creators of literature have well understood. That is not the case here. Everyone in this book is only concerned with themselves, including Rachel, despite her protestations to the contrary. -Why has no one commented on this therapist's boundary issues? -Why does everyone immediately assume, when Megan's dark secret somewhat surfaces, that she was the one to blame, and not her boyfriend? (And how DID it surface?) We and her therapist are the only ones who know what really happened, and although perhaps blaming her is what society realistically might do, perhaps ONE person in this story might doubt the prevailing narrative? Is there no feminist voice in all of this tale that ever speaks up? Anywhere? Is everyone a subservient housewife, everyone a woman-blaming, mother-blaming twit? -Why was it unclear to most readers who committed this crime? We knew pretty early who Megan was having the affair with. And if you didn't pick it up right away, the color of the car gave it away and was confirmed pretty soon in one of Rachel's earliest retrieved memories. -Why, when Megan loses her gallery, is it all she can think to do to have an affair? Can she not commute to London, say on the fucking TRAIN, to work in another one? It's possible that depression and her history may make her less resilient and perhaps unable to imagine her alternatives, but shouldn't her therapist bring this possibility of a new career up right away? -Can Anna really not get another job? Can she really not put her foot down about moving house? Shouldn't her friends make a stink about this all the time? I know they've mentioned it, but she doesn't seem to have a good answer, and she seems stronger than someone who wouldn't have an answer. -Why was no intervention done on Rachel? I mean, really, state she was in. She ought to have been sent to some rehab center long ago, shouldn't she? Universal healthcare and all, right? -Why was there NO SUBTEXT WHATSOEVER? Everything was right there, on the surface. This was the flattest, most superficial read I think I've ever endured, or sat through. If I hadn't been stuck with it on the drive through Nebraska, I would not have finished. I used to be on a list-serv for YA writers and one time a subset of middle-grade writers got into a discussion about writing for autistic-spectrum kids so that all of the emotional cues were made obvious enough for them to track. Well, if you were okay with the violence, drunkenness, murder, sexual affairs, and such, this book would be probably all right, in terms of its emotionally obviousness, for an 8-year old with aspergers. But I was bored. In contrast, I am also listening to Colm Toibin's Nora Webster, and THAT book would be bewildering, I would suspect, to anyone who struggles with emotional cues. Reading these two books back to back did not help Hawkins's literary skills stand up in my eyes one bit, by the way.-Why did Rachel spend all that time explaining how no memories can form during a drunken blackout and then proceed to remember things? I supposed it was because she didn't really black out after all, but I wasn't clear on that.Also Rachel's stupidity at the end approached such a phenomenal level that I sort of wanted her to die or at least rot in prison. Why would she reveal to the villain what she knew?...so many decisions made in service of plot rather than of logic... The point of all my questions is that I was unconvinced that these these things would happen. That these characters would do these things. So I felt they were little chess figures being moved around for the convenience of the author. I supposed there was a little bit of a twist in that I expected that one of the characters at the end would let the other take the fall with the police. That really would have made the most sense. So again, not really a twist, just another chess move. Well there you go. I hope I justified my zero stars over all these inexplicably high stars ratings. Demand more, people, I know you can do it. :)"
"553",552,"Nina Hosseini","Disappointing! I'm not sure how this has been a best seller. I didn't like any of the characters and found them very one dimensional. It lacks any depth and is predictable. "
"554",553,"Sanju Martin Job","I have no idea how this book has got good ratings and being considered for a film adaptation. The book is very very depressing from start until end. Many times I thought of stopping in between. Its just a story about some really f****dup lives and glorifying it as if readers will enjoy reading it. The plot and climax was also very predictable. "
"556",555,"Bev","I cannot understand why this novel has had so much buzz! It took forever to get a copy from my library the waiting list was that long. I was expecting a page turner instead this was just plain boring."
"557",556,"Shanon","I couldn't do it. Couldn't bring myself to finish it which is saying a lot considering my OCD! Got to about page 75...I was just tired of reading about two completely dysfunctional women."
"558",557,"Glenn","This book should be called "" Psycho Chicks On Parade "". Not a single likeable character. Sloppily written action sequences, figured out the ending 100 pages before the end. The biggest mystery is why this became a best seller."
"563",562,"Mia","Not my cup of tea."
"564",563,"Stephani","1.5 OUT OF 5 STARSFor the whole review, please check out my blog!I’ll start this out by saying that I really wanted to like this book. I tried. But first, let me get into why I even decided to read The Girl on the Train at all.A close friend of mine (Hi, Nik!) loves the Mystery/Thriller genre. As a Young Adult aficionado, I wanted to expand my book palette. So we formed a book club. Every month, we’d choose a book that suited her literature likes and then we’d discuss it over GChat during work hours. For the month of February, we chose The Girl on the Train not only because it was highly talked about (and it was mentioned on an issue of theSkimm!), but also because I wanted to have an opinion about this book in the midst of the hype. Not a year after its publication. Not when the movie is released and it becomes a blockbuster. Right in the thick of things.So those are my disclaimers. 1) Mystery/Thriller is not my go-to genre. 2) A major motivator in reading this book was because I wanted to be in “the cool club”.With those reasons in mind, I tried to appreciate the book for what it was. But I just couldn’t. And this is why:Genre aside, I’m a very subjective reader. I like books in which I can relate to a character. I like having a protagonist to root for. Not to say that I only like books with perfect characters. I guess a better way to say this is, I like books in which I can understand what motivates a character, what makes the protagonist (or antagonist) do the things he/she does.So when I read a book in which every character is simply deplorable, I can’t make a connection to the novel on a personal level. It just becomes words on a page; it might as well be a book on brain surgery because that’s how detached I am from the characters and the plot. 95% of The Girl on the Train is that for me. I didn’t care that a person was missing. Or that someone may be wrongfully convicted. I simply didn’t care. Because they were terrible people anyway.And when the big reveal actually happens, it was just so…anti-climactic and lacked the depth this type of story deserves. This is the best way to describe The Girl on the Train: LACKING. It’s lacking compassion, lacking appeal, lacking explanation, lacking feeling.Despite all the things I said up there, there is one chapter that I thought was brilliant. I can’t mention specifics without giving any of the plot away but if you do read the book–Rachel’s chapter that starts on page 216. What a great chapter. The juxtaposition between the two events. Wow. That chapter alone made me decide to give the book a 1.5 as opposed to a 1.I’m going to be honest, if a movie adaptation does happen, I would still watch it. Because The Girl on the Train is the type of book that you can imagine to be better on screen. And I know it’s a travesty for a book lover to say that (because the book is ALWAYS better than the movie), but some books have more of a visual appeal–you don’t have to invest as much time when watching a film.I may be alone in my feelings towards this book and that’s totally fine. I read it to form a personal opinion about the novel amidst all the current talk. So if you’re the type of reader that wants to have a say on the current bestseller, then definitely read The Girl on the Train and refute my claims. For those of you who could care less about what everyone else is talking about, you can read it after Jennifer Lawrence or Keira Knightley is casted as one of the leads and still be ahead of the game.Bottomline? There are some books that come highly recommended by everyone (and their mom, it seems) and you read it and you’re like, where has this book been all my life? And then there are books that fall flat, that don’t live up to the hype. For me, The Girl on the Train is the latter.For the whole review, please check out my blog!"
"565",564,"Peachel","It's repetitive, lacking suspense, and poorly structured, but most importantly, it makes women look crazy and weak. This is probably the worst book I've ever read. If I hadn't borrowed it from the library, I would be burning it right now. "
"566",565,"Zinjah","This is the last time I'm reading a book based on hype. I've yet to read a hyped story that was actually worth the fuss. Add ""Gone Girl 2"" to the list..."
"567",566,"Leann Covey","I thought this book was terrible. We read it for book club and if you liked ""Gone Girl"", you were supposed to enjoy this book. This is nothing like Gillian Flynn. There is no smart and intricate plot, its just disgusting and pathetic people with no redeeming qualities stumbling through life. Not to spoil it for anyone, but basically something happens and it is pages upon pages of the main characters inability to remember something because she is a black out drunk. All of a something, she remembers and then there is supposed to be a dramatic ending. I would not recommend unless you have absolutely nothing else to read."
"569",568,"Idalis","DNF!!"
"570",569,"Gail","hated it!"
"572",571,"Natalie","I just hate this book. Everybody is just miserable and it's written like a diary - I hate that. So therefore 1 star from me... I really, really wanted to like this book because I've heard so much good about it but I'm just disappointed "
"573",572,"Julia Murphy","Creepy, no characters were worth liking, and the twists just weren't compelling."
"575",574,"Cassie Brooks","What a disappointment. Putting this book in the same sentence as Gone Girl is the work of some masterful publicist; there is no comparison!"
"576",575,"Jackie","This was awful. The writing was just bad. I get how everyone wants it to be this summer's ""Gone Girl,"" but at least Flynn knows how to use suspense and her premise was original. ""The Girl on the Train"" was both predictable and boring. I literally eye rolled my way through it. Not a single character was believable. The twist was only halfway decent, the ending absolutely horrible and unbelievable."
"578",577,"Olivia K.","too much, too many. not for me."
"580",579,"Anne Germain","Made me so uncomfortable I couldn't finish it."
"582",581,"Newty_boy","Oh my god. This book is just flat out terrible. Messy writing, horrible, horrible characters and the plot was just ridiculous. Save yourself and don't read this. "
"583",582,"Leslie","I don't understand the popularity. I really don't."
"584",583,"Redjoy","annoying characters. okay conclusion but painful trip getting there."
"585",584,"Jill Title","That. Was. Tedious. I've been really spoiled with some amazing books lately, so I guess it had to happen sometime. I did not like that at all. It was like drunk Nancy Drew, but more predictable. I'm sure there's something I could say about the gender portrayals as well, but I don't have the energy. "
"587",586,"Holly Hollis","First, I would like to point out that I've never taken the time to write a negative book review. However, I feel compelled to speak up. My advice: please don't waste your time. I think ""The Girl on the Train"" tried to copy ""Gone Girl"" but it just didn't work. First of all, the book went ON and ON about the main character Rachel Watson and her drinking problem. TONS of pointless details. WHO CARES? Rachel's character was not even remotely likable. She was lazy and rolled in self pity. To be fair, ALL of the characters were miserable people- it wasn't just Rachel. How can you write a book without ONE likable character? What's the point? (I've asked several friends how they felt about the characters and got the same response that ""they were all miserable people). In what universe is this book a best seller?I could in theory live with the miserable characters and copycat theme (things did get a little more interesting after I had listened to about 75% of the book). HOWEVER, just as I was getting slightly interested in the characters and plot- there was a line in the book that was SO OFFENSIVE to me. I can't remember the exact wording, but when Tom Watson was speaking to Rachael at the end of the book, he said something to the effect of ""you're like one of those abused and neglected dogs that comes back after a beating with its tail wagging..."". WTF?????? SERIOUSLY? That is a terrible thing to say and a horrible comparison. What sane person would even think to say something like that? People can defend themselves, people have free will and can make choices (example: Rachel Watson is a lazy drunk, Anna Watson is selfish, Meghan Hippwell is irresponsible, and Tom Watson is a sociopath). Animals on the other hand, are defenseless. It was such a flippant remark. I read and listen to a LOT of books. I honestly can't remember EVER being ""offended"" by a book until now. So, congratulations Paula Hawkins (if an overwhelming feeling of repulsion is what you were going for....you succeeded). Not that she will ever read this- but what would make me feel better is if she would donate part of her book sales to an animal charity. In sum- I would recommend reading this book if you enjoy hearing the sound of nails on a chalkboard. "
"588",587,"Jan","Very Depressing. Told in the first person by 3 young women; the main character is an alcoholic suffering from memory loss, creating confusion and frustration. Each chapter is dated, but not in chronological order leaving me feeling like I should go back and check previous dates. This just added to my dislike of the book. I felt like the author wrote 3 short stories, and then jumbled them together. The ""who done it"" became very evident before being revealed."
"589",588,"Tonya Conway","Ugh."
"592",591,"Dawna","Sorry to say to my friends who read this book & liked it, I can't read it. :( The story begins with such sadness & the characters are disturbed & suffering. Didn't find it to be that well written either. "
"593",592,"LaZia","Good the initial idea but really really really boring the execution!!!!!"
"594",593,"Fiona Menzies-Henderson","You know I gave this one star but even at that it's too much!!! so many reviews everyone buzzing about this book and to be honest I thought it was a lot of rubbish from start to middle when o could not take anymore and shelved it! "
"596",595,"Abigail Bandek","Sumamente predecible,aún no entiendo El porqué de la comparación con "" gone girl""."
"597",596,"Whitney","People. Please don't read this book. Seriously. The only thing I am happy about is that I patiently waited for the book to be available from the library instead of wasting $8.99 to buy it on Kindle. My subconscious knew that I would be pissed if I yet again succumbed to the hype of another bad book that is clearly backed by a publishing house that pays enough people to push it as ""the next big thing."" My alternate theory is that there is some sort of social experiment going on where some corporation (Facebook perhaps?) is trying to see how many people give a terrible book a 5-star Amazon review simply because it already has 1,000 5-star Amazon reviews.Because really, someone please tell me what there is to like about this book. First, The characters are terrible and poorly developed. I get that the point of some books is that you dislike all of the characters. But if that was the intent here, it was not done well. Second, it was terribly predicable. I have a history of not being able to predict anything. Which is a great quality for books with a twist. I am often surprised when others saw the twist coming 100 pages earlier. So if I knew what was going to happen, it was glaringly obvious. Not even a twist. Third, it can hardly be described as a page-turner. 30% of the way through I kept waiting for that itch to keep reading it. It finally came at 80% when I realized that it was going to be terrible and I just wanted to get it over with as soon as humanly possible. Finally, the storyline was stupid. Not creative, just twisted and bad. At least Gone Girl was creative in the total insanity of the characters. This was just weird and bad. Please, please don't read this book. Or at the very least, stop giving it 5 stars so that others are not tricked. And if you do give it 5 stars, please tell me why. "
"599",598,"Lea Maus","Es más la publicidad que le hacen que lo bueno de la historia. Una escritura vaga, que escupe una palabra tras otra, con un final trillado y personajes totalmente predecibles. El comienzo es totalmente aburrido, incluso con los «pasajes intrigantes», uno ya sabe lo que pasará. Abuso doméstico, lagunas mentales... pero los personajes lo ignoran. Parece una historia escrita para el «Novedades». En resumen, es como leer a Bella Swan adulta y alcohólica."
"601",600,"Domenica Apriceno","non so dire se mi è piaciuto o no, le emozioni sono contrastanti, si è carino, ma mi ha deluso un po.certo ha la sua supense, ma non mi convince.forse è una mia sensazione, ma è un tantino lento, a tratti noioso, perchè ti perdi nelle varie spiegazioni.carino il punto di vista delle tre donne, ma è sempre di basso profilo, forse verso l'ultima parte si comincia a rialzare.forse hanno sopravvalutato questo libro, perchè sinceramente sono dubbiosa che sia un capolavoro.troppa pubblicità, troppo osannato.. infatti incuriosita da tanta pubblicità ci sono cascata.. e l'ho compartoil mio regalo di natale è stato un flop."
"602",601,"Lynne","I expected it to be more intriguing...alcoholism and domestic abuse aren't enjoyable reading for me."
"603",602,"Niki","I reluctantly give this book 1 star. Maybe 1.5 stars. I suppose the author did a good job of developing the characters since I know them well enough to deduce that I hate every last person in this book. I hate Rachel, I hate Megan, I hate Anna, I hate Tom, I hate the therapist, I hate the roomate and I hate Scott just a bit less than the others. I struggled to finish this book. Rachel is the ex-wife of Scott. Scott cheated on her with Anna who is now his wife. They have a child which Rachel was never able to produce. Scott and Anna are neighbors with Tom and Megan. Rachel is a sad sack of an alchoholic who sees Scott and Anna each day on their back deck from her seat on the train. Rachel also routinely intrudes on the life of her ex Tom and his new wife Anna. She covets the lives of both couples. The story is narrated from the viewpoint of each of the women, except you can't believe anything they say because it is skewed to their own selfish viewpoint. I will stop here and not provide any spoilers. Ok maybe just one:The red herring in this mystery actually has red hair.....GOOD GRIEF!!!!!!"
"607",606,"Kyle","I was so ready for this book to knock the socks right off my feet...it didn't even manage to tickle them.I hated this book. I really did. It was a complete struggle to get through. The biggest problem I had was with the MC. She was a weak, obscenely dumb, pitying fool. Although, I found none of the characters remotely interesting (except maybe Cathy. I sort of enjoyed her). None of them were likeable in the least. I guess we have the author to blame for that...as well as the horrid, Lifetime movie-worthy writing! It seriously felt like a daytime TV event. No normal person acts the way some of these characters acted (which was with an utter lack of intelligence). No police officers are that catty, rude, and incompetent.I figured out the ending fairly early on in this underwhelming whodunnit. There were a few red herrings thrown about, but they were not wholly developed enough to convince (I'm sure a seven-year-old could've seen through such transparent writing/characters).I was hoping for an experience on par with the writing of Gillian Flynn, but I guess I aimed a bit too high. The readers reviewing this book and giving it more than 3 stars are most-likely the kind of people that enjoy/are entertained by cheap, PG-13 type thrillers like the Beyoncé-led 'Obsessed', or the harebrained 'No Good Deed'.This book is unoriginal, sloppy, and just...dumb! It's like Gone Girl's third cousin twice removed (the one with the cleft lip and poor social skills that lives in Great Aunt Millie's attic and likes to reenact scenes from Casablanca with dead mice).I'm amazed at the praise it has been receiving, because nothing about it was suspenseful, intriguing, or hard to comprehend. It doesn't leave you guessing, it leaves you kind of bored and feeling sad for it.I urge you. Challenge yourself- READ SOMETHING ELSE!Avoid. Avoid. Avoid."
"608",607,"Sharon Sorken","The one star is because I finished it! A suspense thriller? So much whining and ""I'm sorry"" that reading was a chore. The best part was the ending even though it was easy to guess who the killer was."
"609",608,"Lana Sims","The plot was quite similar to Gone Girl, but with even less appealing characters. An alcoholic on the train suffers a blackout and tries to put the pieces together in the backdrop of a missing/possibly dead woman. I completed the book, hoping for a brilliant plot twist at the end. My hopes were in vain. "
"614",613,"Patricia Lovell","I really don't understand why this book was such a big hit. The plot wasn't that clever, it was fairly clear where we were going just over halfway through (and I'm usually quite bad at predicting endings). The characters were so unsympathetic it was difficult to work up any interest in or enthusiasm for any of them - particularly the main character. It's strange the way some books grab the limelight and everyone wants to read them. I work in a library and practically everyone who brought it back in (having waited for months to get a copy usually) said they hated it. "
"615",614,"Rò","Most boring book of 2015. I don't understand why people thought it was ok to make a movie about it? I mean, I fell asleep seven times while reading it. "
"616",615,"Michelle Doherty","I don't get the hype for this book. I thought it was awful, and could not stand the always drunk main character. I finished it but wished I hadnt bothered. At least it was a library book and I didn't pay money for it."
"617",616,"Denise Diehl","There was so much buzz about this book being so great I couldn't wait . I couldn't have been more disappointed. It was so drawn out and boring . It was hard for me to even finish it . I definitely would not recommend it ."
"619",618,"SueGoCo","How can some of these books get such high ratings? I thought it was contrived, that it glorified alcohol abuse, that the characters were bland, each of the three narrators almost indistinguishable from each other. "
"620",619,"Ariste Egan","This was one of the most boring books I have read. The plot was slow moving and there wasn't a single likable character. The ""shocking"" ending fell flat."
"622",621,"Deborah","For the life of me I cannot figure out why this book is so highly touted. Psychological Thriller? Not for me. Gripping page turner? Nope. I had to force myself to keep reading as I was reading it for a book club. Flat writing. Flat characters. No real shocking plot twists...I knew what was coming long before the end. This would not even make a good one hour t.v. crime drama. If you haven't yet purchased it or committed your time, walk away. "
"623",622,"Once Was Editor","So much hype surrounded this book, and I can't fathom why. Absurd story whose only impetus are convenient flashbacks to drive the narrative from Point A to Point B. Some of the writing is very amateur, e.g. the protagonist once remarking how she was 'slumbering' in bed. Honestly, who talks like that? Found it impossible to stay invested in the story."
"625",624,"Carmensutra","I don't know a single person who doesn't look out the train window and idealize the world that they see before them--snapshots of panoramic scenery perfect in the second you get to see it and of people captured a moment of perfect living. That postcard, forever ingrained in your memory, stays as the epitome of a beautiful moment or place or person. It's impossible to know the trials and tribulations of others lives without the time and the microscope to examine them. But, come to think of it, how many people do you every really get to ""know""? This is an excellent premise for a book, 2014's version of ""Gone Girl."" I will start by saying that I was NOT a fan of ""Gone Girl."" The ending was a complete cop-out and it ruined everything Flynn had worked so hard to build throughout the first part of the novel. This story is told from the perspective of 3 female characters. Each character had a distinct voice, literally in the audiobook, but I could sense distinct shifts in her writing style for each. Hawkins is a master of finding and developing her character's voices. However, I actually found some of the plot plain misogynistic and the more I delved into the lives of these characters, the more I just wanted to put the audiobook away and never bother to know the ending. Without a doubt, ALL the characters were terrible people doing horrible things, but not in any endearing way. I cringed so many times, it's going to take me a few weeks to shake this feeling of discomfort. It's a ""thriller"" and your head might spin as the ending unfolds, but I would rather spend my time with something that doesn't make me so...bereft."
"627",626,"Joe","Yeesh. I really wanted to like this book but I was only able to read about half of it before I became incredibly bored. I gave up on it. "
"628",627,"Bethany Wilson Buckner","I really, really wanted to like this book. I'm sorry, I hate it. Creepy story. Creepy characters that I also hate."
"630",629,"Diyala Erekat","And here's to another book I couldn't finish! I don't know either that these days the 5-star/MUST-READ books are just terrible, or I am being too picky and way too judgmental! Anyway, I tried to finish it, couldn't! I ended up reading a summary and I wasn't surprised at all, simply because all the characters are assholes! There is no single character in the whole book that you would like! The narratives of the story are pathetic; alcoholic creepy stalker, paranoid home wrecker, and a depressed cheater, and their life revolves around the men in their life, as if their lives are only defined by the men! Argh! Reading through Rachel's POV drove me mad! Well, I never been around anyone suffering from drinking problems, so I couldn't understand how desperate and pathetic she sounded. It made me sad to see how her life changed completely, and I wonder about all the people around who dont have anyone to help them through their darkest times, and how terrible it would be not to have anyone to be there and help them get the help they needed! It just made me realize how important is having your support group around you!!Unlike Rachel, she had no one, her roommate could have helped more, but this one was either with her boyfriend all the time or sitting waiting for him to call/come by! And I am sorry, but how old is Rachel? In her 30s! , have she ever heard of ""things aren't usually what it seems""? This is aside from the story, what pissed me off, that she kept saying that Scout is great, they are the prefect couple, and yadi yada yada! YOU DONT EVEN KNOW WHAT HAPPENS BEHIND THE CLOSED DOORS! You dont even know what they are talking about! She was just like a kid, imagining things the way she wanted, even if they turned up to be as so, which is not, but she put Scout and Megan in a vessel and expected them to act accordingly. she interpreted what she saw according to that, which messed everything up! And this bullshit of not remembering what happened, and then remembering parts at the perfect moment, how convenient! About Anna, well, I can't sympathize with her, she got into a relationship with a married man, there is no excuse for that, whatsoever! She made sense to be freaked out of Rachel; the woman can't move on! But I just couldn't sympathize with her! She knew his wife was unstable, she brought it to herself! And well, when a guy cheat with you, he will cheat on you. Because HE IS A CHEATERAnd Megan, our cheater missing person, she cheated on her husband, not once or twice , hundreds of times, and she would feel guilty but not guilty enough, to not cheat and respect her marriage! I seriously can't understand the cheaters, you dont want to be around, leave! The rest of the characters in the book are so irritable! Waste of time! You already started? Bored already? Read the summary, you won't be shocked you probably guessed it anyway."
"631",630,"Jon","I was looking forward to this--a debut thriller that has topped the NY Times bestseller list for months. I was disappointed. The characters are cliches; the thriller elements, such as they are, are anything but fresh; even the plot is hackneyed. A main character who is a black-out drunk half-heartedly wants to quit drinking, nevertheless repeatedly gets drunk, gets embarrassing, makes foolish decisions, and has to apologize (and I do mean repeatedly). However much this may reflect real life, it is tedious to read. Of course she can't quite remember what she suspects was a key incident that occurred on one of her drunken rambles. We tread water for most of the book, with the author doling out little pieces of what may or may not be accurate information, and finally (finally!) she remembers what happened. The book is alternately narrated in present tense by three women, each highly strung, each to some extent neurotic, each unpleasant. One even narrates her own murder--in present tense; I'm not sure how we're to think that narration got conveyed. I'm puzzled by all the enthusiastic reviews. Oh, for Sarah Waters, who knows how to do this kind of thing."
"634",633,"Anna Samulak","Definitely not the next Gone Girl. The writing is weak and the characters are cliched. So much for the marketing hype. There was one point near the end where I wanted to find out what would happen, so that made it okay. "
"635",634,"Paula S. Yost","Awful!!!Stayed with it. Wish I hadn't. Woe is me. Longest poor me pity party on record and yet no happy ending for anyone, especially the reader."
"636",635,"Judy","This is a waste of precious time. The writing style is very straight-forward and elementary, lacking any subtlety and sophistication. I can see that this could possibly make an okay movie, but the prose is very amateurish. "
"637",636,"Andy Whitt","I rated it 2 stars then a week later changed it to a 1. Did Not like it at all. I did not like any of the characters. Maybe it should be a 0 star for me. "
"640",639,"Cassie Stoddart","I really had high expectations when I picked this book up cause I'd read the reviews but in all honesty it was just a hot mess. Rachel is just a drunk who is always riding the train back and forth and doesn't really want to tackle her addiction and deal with it head on. She lives in her head most of the time drifting away from reality creating fantasies....*yawn*"
"641",640,"Nehal Nabil","Saying I'd hated the book is a blasphemous understatement. This's the kind of books you tell yourself  I don't have to be stone-cold sober while I do this, just let me be bitter. I'm not here to objectively criticize the book, because, god knows, I don't need to waste more time on it than I already did.I just need to vent. Having finished it is something akin to an emotional break-up, which luckily, I experienced it firsthand from a book & not a 'he'. I was traumatized, I turned the last page with eagerness I never thought existed, thanking everything & everyone & appraising all the good in the world all the bliss in my life it's over. And your answer to why I've not aborted is because I paid a fuckton of money on that book & I've commitment issues such as I can never abandon a book no matter how shitty it is.I hated the characters, I hated how bad the writing was; the narrative, the tackiness, the anti-heroine (Rachel is a shame to anyone who's referred to as she), the motif -if ever was present-, every fuckinng thing from the cover to the nonexistent prologue.I mean, come on, everything has a capacity that can't be exceeded. Picture this: domestic abuse, trauma, a so-called tragic past, alcoholism, mental & emotional abuse & betrayal all in 323 pages! Having bits & pieces everywhere, nothing coherent, no basis, amateurish! If one wants to do 'realistic', I'm not that much of an expert, but I can tell when mission fails.I was irrevocably disappointed, I was bracing for some hype albeit I'm a harsh critic, but damn, can this get a negative star?"

"647",646,"Blanca","Slow and boring. By page 251 nothing had happened yet. What a let down. The reviews were so good.The main character is a 30 year old divorced drunkard who must think she's a detective of some kind. She's also a stalker and won't let her ex husband and his new family alone. The book has no plot at all. NOTHING happens during the whole book. If you don't want to waste money, but most importantly, your time, leave it in the library shelve. "
"648",647,"Lisa Sharamitaro","Relentless self loathing. Because there are so many rave reviews for the book and for the audiobook swirling around, I kept coming back to see what all the hoopla was about. I did my best to avoid spoilers when checking to see what people liked about it before deciding to give the audiobook a try. I'm most of the way through and will finish because I want to know if it will end up being worth spending so much time inside the heads of such horrible, self-loathing characters. Honestly, more than once I have had to turn it off just to avoid getting lost in the belief that my life is as distasteful as these women's. I won't go on about it, but consider this a trigger warning. I wish I hadn't started down these pathetic rabbit holes of character study. Well written, but not anything I would wish on a friend."

"655",654,"Madysen Nardi","One of the worst books I've read...almost finished all of it but HAD to skip the last 20 pages because it was so boring! Thought the book was going to be amazing like Gone Girl from the summary...nope I was wrong. The characters were horrible. Everybody seemed like the same. I had to keep checking who was telling their story because I was getting confused on their point of view. The three women were bland, drunk, sad, and lonely.The book also didn't feel like a ""mystery/thriller."" It went from alcoholics to baby problems to affairs. It seemed like ""wine"" and ""drunk"" was on each page. This book was very disappointing and I wasted almost $30."
"659",658,"Anuradha Kothandaraman","Ugh.. Can I give negative rating??? poorly written.. very negative characterization.. seems like something set in 1960s not 2013.. absolute disaster. Hope the author finds her calling because.. this is not it!"
"660",659,"Tia L.","I did not get the lure of this book. It was so far fetched and unrealistic. The main character was miserable, whiny and altogether unlikable.

"662",661,"Rehannah","What a let-down. I was so excited in buying and reading this book because of the reviews and ratings. I JUST WANTED IT TO END (also referring to my sUFFERING). It kept going on and on and I just wanted to curl up in a ball and push it away from me using a stick. I had to drag myself through this book. ""Get your shit together @self let's get this over with."" I felt dead inside while reading this book as I was not interested. From start to finish I was extremely bored that it took me 5 days to force myself to read. I did quite like the ""twist"" or whatever the heck that was but let me tell you that DID NOT do enough justice for the trainwreck I went through. A message I've sent to friends that is relevant and what convinced me to make a review (I sent this on the 4th day): I've been trying to read The Girl On the Train for at least 4 days now and I'm stuck and it's so horrible and I'm just crying because I need to get through this tornado of messed up strangers just so I can say I kind of didn't waste my money on this bullshit. Save yourself before it's too late, please. Don't end up like me. You do not want to end up like me.Additional info (Jan 2 2016): YOU KNOW WHAT THIS BOOK IS?

"668",667,"Maureen Horner","This was hard to finish! I just kept wanting the characters to become better people....to learn something. Sadly, the book ended with very little hope for the futures of the characters that I had grown to......oh, who are we kidding, I couldn't care less about any of them. Not worth your time unless you like depressing, boring, pathetic characters."
"669",668,"Becky Masters","Have you ever read a book that you hoped would never end? Well, this isn't one of them. I breathed a sigh of relief, which ideally would have been based on a thrilling climax. Not. I was just glad the thing had concluded with a whimper, which pretty much describes the agonizing plot of an alcoholic trying throughout the whole book to recall what happened during a blackout."
"670",669,"Lynsey","The story is split between three women, all equally weak, flawed & unlikable. Not very cleverly crafted in my humble opinion. Although it sounded promising for the first few chapters, it soon transpires that nothing much happens for half of the book. The big twist or amazing conclusion which may nave redeemed the book didn't happen, and the ending announced itself loudly way before the unconvincing climax. And if Rachel's ex had changed his phone numbers and email address like any normal person being majorly harassed by an obsessive, alcoholic ex wife, there would be no story at all. Rather handily, this became a good cover story for him to cheat on his new wife. What was the point of the ginger haired man? A poorly executed red herring? Or the piles of clothes that made regular appearances on the side of the train tracks? I should have known better when it was compared with Gone Girl. I hated that too. Don't believe the hype."
"671",670,"Elaine Chang","Who said this book is comparable to Gone Girl?? It is nothing like Gone Girl. No twist at all. Not a turn pager. The story finally picked up a tiny pace by 80%. Even when the truth came out, I wasn't amused. The story is written from POV of three main woman characters but I find the usage of words and the way the ladies think were the same writing style and some time I thought it was same woman talking! The dates are confusing to me. There's no point in putting the date at beginning of each chapter as I don't remember them. I have a hard time keeping up on the time, which chapters are flashbacks which chapters are real time. To fellow readers, if you haven't read Gone Girl. I highly recommended it."
"672",671,"Karmologyclinic","I do like unreliable and unlikable narrators as much as the next reader. But the narrators here lack character, they are paper thin deep, popular psychology slash soap opera slash reality tv cliche inspired. The narration pattern makes no sense (the writer informs us that we are reading the diaries of the women when each starts their narration, but midway just forgets about the fact that they are supposed to be diaries). The suspense escalation is awkward and unrewarding. The solution of the mystery is childish and random, based on coincidence and it's made of what bad mysteries are made of: a total disregard for the story and the characters you spent time reading.Also there are random red herrings that make no sense at all, one of them is red haired?! wtf? And amnesia as the main theme? Really? There's one good thing about this book, it's easy to read, although mediocre in writing. This is enough for best sellers, I guess. Also, enough for people who are not used to reading good mysteries and might find this entertaining. Whatever. "

I loved reading Amy Dunne's journal entries. I love the fact that her husband kept secrets from you, the reader.This book didn't exactly have unreliable narrators; it just had a bunch of clueless ones. Rachel can't remember hardly anything. I don't see that as unreliable or keeping secrets from you. She just happens to remember things as the story goes along.I'm really surprised I finished the book, but I wanted to find out what all the twists were. Turns out it was just the same twist over and over and over with different characters in the story.The only thing this had similar to Gone Girl was the fact that someone's wife went missing.I found this book very dull. Go read Gone Girl."

"679",678,"DR","Oh, boy--I hated this book, every fruitless minute of it! In fact, I’m petitioning Kronos to credit my lifespan’s longevity with the time it took me to read THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN. Main protagonist Rachel Watson is a mess. By her own description “a barren, divorced, soon-to-be homeless alcoholic” (p50). She’s literally that fat, weird-smelling, tedious, incoherently muttering passenger sitting near you on public transportation who ruins your entire ride. Physically and emotionally wrecked, totally unreconciled to a two-years-old divorce, jobless Rachel begins occupying herself with fantasies of murder-solving. In a moment of lucidity, Rachel admits: “I would drive me mad” (p22). Amen! Our boozy, deluded heroine might be tolerable if Paula Hawkins had offered us a better story or, at least, a surprise ending that met the definition. At best, the travails of train-riding, pudding-brained Rachel are “cautionary tales for the blacked-out drinker"" (p68). At worst, THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN is the above-mentioned waste of a reader’s time."
"681",680,"Di","What a waste of a great story idea. Thriller? Not when you can see who the culprit is from quite early on in this underdeveloped story. Gripping, enthralling? No. Frustrating?

I don't need to read about someone so messed up and without hope. It seems like people like to read books like this. Yes, the ending was good but it was the only time any action actually happened. Otherwise it was just reading about the main character's stupor and humiliation. I originally picked this book up because of the ""thriller"" category but overall is what more depressing than thrilling."
"684",683,"Michelle Strommen","I didn't make it through the book. There was so much talk about it, I wanted to like it. I couldn't get into it. I thought it was going to be a mystery, but it wasn't. I didn't like the character and found Rachel a bit whiny. Going back to my normal crime/law books."
"685",684,"Amy Dobrzynski","Did not like this book, only read 50 pages in. It was confusing to understand which character was narrating and it was boring material a quarter of the way into it. I ended up asking someone how it ended so I didn't need to waste my time on it."

"688",687,"Barbara Poore","I did not exactly like Gone Girl, but could see the rationale behind its popularity. Cannot see it here. The premise of the book is that an alcoholic unemployed woman takes the train from the suburbs to London every day and as the train slows down passing her old neighborhood, she looks down on a young couple who live on the street where she used to live. She was compelled to leave her home because her husband cheated on her, divorced her and married someone else. She invents stories about the couple in the house as she passes every day. Then the woman disappears and suspense ensues. The book consists of three intertwining internal monologues of these women--all unreliable narrators in their way, and none likable. The nebbishy men become more menacing over time. The chronology advances and goes backwards in annoying fits and starts. Very confusingThe whole premise is ridiculous. Who gets fired from their job for drinking and continues to pretend that they are going to work for months and months? How much does she spend on this and where does she get the money? There are so many of these improbabilities, but describing them would make for spoilers.I was on the wait list at the library for months for this book, and then a rainy period caused me to order a kindle copy. Wouldn't you know it that my reservation came through after I bought it. BTW if you do read it, get the actual book. Going back and forth in the kindle to try to figure out the chronology is tedious."

It is very rare that I leave a bad review on a book.But this was the most boring thriller I have ever read. And the last time I checked thriller and boring aren't two words that should go together. I found it incredibly hard to connect to any of the characters. the plot was strange and just soooooo bad. So so bad.Scott was annoying. Anna irritated the living shit out of me. Tom can go fuck himself. And Megan well, rest her soul.This is a shitty review for a shitty book."

Por ter sido muito comparado com Garota Exemplar eu já comecei a leitura esperando um plot twist, mas a solução do crime dá pra sacar bem no começo. Não funcionou como suspense pra mim porque eu não consegui ficar curioso e me importar com os personagens. E a autora ainda usa uns truques bem manjados de colocar personagens aleatórios no meio da história pro leitor ficar ""hmmm ele pode ser o assassino"" e no fim das contas o tal personagem não tem relevância nenhuma rs.

Why is it even being compared to Gone Girl?!The Girl on the Train is one of the most boring books I've had the misfortune of reading. The only reason this one didn't end up as a DNF is because I kept telling myself it was going to get better at some point. Because, I thought, a book published this year that has more than two hundred thousand ratings (impressive, huh?) must be good. Sadly, that wasn't the case. The characters were as messed-up as the ones in Gillian Flynn's novel, but where Amy and Nick managed somehow to be attractive to the readers, Rachel and the rest of her team were stuck in this awful hole of pity that made them both uninteresting and pathetic. The writing wasn't as good, either. Flynn has one of the most captivating proses I've read, and Hawkins didn't even get close to it. When it comes to thrillers, I need to get into the story quickly or I'll get bored, and that was my main issue with this book."

"713",712,"Books  R Us","This is a very hyped novel. Mainly for adults, however, as everyone's raving that this is going to be the next Gone Girl. They're calling it fast-paced, creepy and thrilling. Saying it's going to be the big hit of the year and everyone will love it. You see, this is precisely why I hate hype. It just sets the book up for failure. First of all, I think comparing this to Gone Girl is stupid. That was a masterpiece. It was tense, shocking and had one of the best twists I've ever read. This book has one of the shittiest and most predicable twists of all time. About 10 pages after we found out Megan died, I knew it. You see, we have 3 main suspects.-Scott-That redheaded bloke Rachel saw on the train. -Tom. Scott was a very predictable choice and Hawkins would have had to pull off something extraordinary to make his reveal shocking. I didn't see that happening at all. Therefore, I ruled him out. We didn't even have much background information on the redhead to know much about him. Plus if it was him, it wouldn't exactly be shocking as he's a character we don't even know. Therefore, I ruled him out. And then we have Tom. The shock that he cheats on his wife who cheated on his ex-wife. Unpredictable and it will come across as shocking. Bingo!Seriously, sometimes this stuff is far too predictable. The plot for this novel was pretty bad. For the majority of it, nothing actually happened. It was very boring also as there was no fast-paced scenes like I was promised. Everything just seemed to take a very slow and very gradually build to an extremely disappointing climax.A lot of the time it was Rachel getting drunk and passing out. Or Anna bitching about Rachel getting drunk and passing out. Or Megan sneaking off with her doctor. Not in the least was that entertaining. The characters, actually, were all horrible. Not Gillian Flynn style horrible, where she still manages to make you care for them and have an odd fascination with them. No, this was just plain horrible. One of them is a drunk. The other two are both cheaters. I'm sorry, am I supposed to relate to them and enjoy their narrative? It was actually very dull, each narrative. There was no life in their characters or general reason for me to like them. The writing style was also really bad. Sometimes I felt like it was putting me to sleep. Sometimes, I'd have to reread lines because I'd gone over them in my head without the information actually going in. The dialogue, also, just wasn't scintillating or thrilling. The descriptions were very lifeless and inexperienced. As a whole, the style just came across as underdeveloped and dry. Also, I'm just wondering, but does Rachel have amazing eyesight? The fact that she managed to see so much into Scott and Megan's life with barely only a glimpse each day is kinda confusing and I'm surprised she's able to gauge so much information purely from glances. Well, what do I know. Maybe she has the eyesight of a bird. Overall, this novel was just so disappointing. The hype is completely unjustified and so not worthy. The characters, plot and writing style are all terrible and a bore to be put through. It takes boring yourself to death to a whole new level. Apparently, this is being into a movie too. You see? Never trust hype. It's annoying and it'll raise your expectations far too much. Also, this book would be a lot less appealing if it was called: The Girl on the Tram. Don't you think? Final Rating = 9%"

"724",723,"Patricia","I started this but gave it up when I realized that the main character was unreliable because she was a galloping alcoholic. My baggage: experienced enough of that in my family, don't need to read about it."
"726",725,"Nerak","Narrators Rachel, Megan, Anna, and characters Scott and Tom, all messed up and unappealing. Skimmed the last third of the book just to find out whether I had guessed right on the crime's perp. Yep."
"727",726,"Louise Lister","Ditto Alexandra's review.........""Depressing from start to finish. Most every single character was a hot mess. I have literally no idea why there are so many 5 star ratings. It kind of scares me. If this kind of garbage is what the masses find appealing...I mean..I didn't care at all about the ""mystery."" It didn't even feel like there was one. It just felt like a tedious glimpse into the messed up lives of people I'd rather not know anything about. """
"728",727,"Geeta","I got this for Spring Break, thinking it would be a fun read. Instead, it was a slog. Nothing about it worked for me: I didn't care that the characters were unlikeable. I cared that they were uninteresting and one dimensional. Nothing changes internally for any of them from chapter to chapter. This is not a psychological thriller when the psychology is so flat. The writing was pedestrian and the plot started off well and then fizzled. A woman on a train witnesses something she can't remember, a clue possibly to another woman's disappearance. This witness is a drunk who has been dumped by her husband, and this makes her unreliable, not in the Wayne Booth sense of the word, but in the most predictable way--she can't remember things. I got halfway through the book, then skipped to the end just to find out what happened. Not surprisingly, I didn't really care. "
"729",728,"Titus G","Drek. Chapters from the perspective of three women who all thought the same things in the same way with the same limited vocabulary. Use of alcoholism to deceive the reader with incredibly selective memory loss. The thoughts and worries of another character did not include an extramarital affair. But unfortunately I stayed to find out what the plot really was and who committed murder. The action sequences in the final 30 pages of the book were unrealistic and unbelievable because of their stupidity. The New York times said this was a best seller. So are MacDonalds."
"730",729,"Gingerwilliam","This book was a big disappointment for me - I followed the hype.Multiple points of view were confusing since all the characters were exactly the same and totally interchangeable. Ending was contrived, characters weak and one-dimensional.It meandered, only had a single tone and the pace never changed - utterly monotonous.The fact that it won any sort of an award is, frankly, beyond me. "
"732",731,"Jean Bernadette","Never have I read a book with such detestable characters. I mean, there are detestable characters that make stories more interesting and there are some that kill it; this book falls on the latter. "
"734",733,"Sakib Ahmed","Ok i'm not a reader and i decided to start reading for fun. I bought into the hype of this book and picked it up for my first book to read. All i can say is this book is very disappointing. And bad. The characters are terrible. i hate all of them. It's impossible to like any of them. Rachael is a drunk crazy. Megan is a slutty loser. And Anna is a paranoid prick. I was hoping to be rooting for one of them, but you just can't. They are all idiots. My mistake, i was actually rooting for Rachael, rooting for her to get killed in the end. And using drunken amnesia as a major part of the plot is just bad. And the ending was terrible and obvious. Nothing suspenseful and thrilling. Don't buy into the hype. Skip this book. "
"735",734,"Uread","So bad! Even for one whose native language is not English. "
"736",735,"Crystal Candis","I couldn't finish this book. At one time I had a pretty serious alcohol problem, and reading about Rachel's life was difficult. At points it was spot on, it just made me seriously uncomfortable. Plus I just couldn't make myself care about any of the characters."

"742",741,"Erica Chiarkas","I can't even stand this book. Maybe it's because I read so many good books right before it. But I can't even make it to page 100. The characters do absolutely nothing for me. I quit."
"743",742,"Jim C","disappointed in this ""thriller""...was not interested in the lead characters or any of the other members of this drama. It reads like a Lifetime movie plot set in the UK."
"745",744,"Jeremy","I couldn't find a single character in the entire book to like, and the plot left quite a bit wanting. I finished it, but just because I normally finish books I start. I was hoping for more after I saw it won in the Mystery/Thriller category in the Reader's Choice awards (that was all I knew about it going in), but unless all the other books nominated were terrible, I'm not sure how it won."
"746",745,"Skyler","The Girl On The Train? More like The Girl On My Nerves! Ha, see what I did there. This novel is insane. The characters are a mess, the story is basically just a shitty Law & Order SVU episode, and it's all jumbled together in shifting timelines and POV as a way to force suspense. Also, the entire plot rests on the fact that a Drunk Girl (read:frequently blackout) sees a couple sitting on their porch so often while passing in a train, that she recognizes when something strange happens. My first and only question, how slow is this train going?Maybe this book is actually a Sobriety PSA in disguise?These are not characters you love to hate / hate to love. These are just awful, bland characters that make you wonder why you continue reading..."

"748",747,"Nena","(Audiobook) As I browsed Listopia for a good psychological thriller that I could sink my teeth into, the jacket of this book jumped out at me. The Girl on the Train. Described as ""Hitchcockian, a shocking ride, a harrowing new novel of suspense, psychologically gripping . . . Ooooh. Yum. Thoughts of Strangers on a Train, Rear Window or Rope danced like sugar plums in my head. I went on a waiting list to download this from my audiolibrary and chomped at the bitt waiting for this to come in. After three long weeks I finally have my hands on this book.I downloaded this last night and started listening a little before I went to bed. Gazing out the window I noticed tiny snowflakes flying about here and there. I woke up eager to continue listening to the book anticipating a few hours of a good adrenaline rush. While I cooked my collard greens and smoked ham hocks (a delicious recipe that I stumbled on over at Youtube - look for Divas Can Cook), I stuffed my earbuds into my ears to continue this intriguing story which is narrated by three separate females who sounded identical. Having a hard time distinguishing who was who I shook it off. In between sips of green tea with a cinnamon stick added just for that tiny hint of sweetness, I listened intently waiting eagerly for the suspense to begin. By the time I was ready to sit down and enjoy my lovely collard greens and ham dinner, I was as bored as you are right now reading a re-cap of my dull day. I darted up the stairs and came here to write my review, saying to myself "" . . . and it's not going to be pretty"". If you are expecting an intense story with a plot that moves at lightening speed, if you are expecting characters that grab you and twist you around their fingers like silly putty, a story that sucks you in and will not release you far after you are done, where you find your mind relentlessly trying to piece the puzzle together, reluctant to do anything in your life other than listen to this story, if you are waiting for ""a shocking ride, a harrowing new novel of suspense, psychologically gripping"", then I'd turn back if I were you. The author is dumber than a box of rocks if you ask me. She had an opportunity to write a story that would have equaled if not surpassed Hitchcock leaving him in her dust. So much potential. So epic a fail. The only way I can explain how there are so many rave reviews and such a run on this book is that someone pulled a Harry Potter and cast a spell of unfathomable potency rendering the general public totally and blindly bewitched. Other than that explanation, you got me. I'm stumped. And therein may be the real mystery to this hot mess.If you want to know what this book is about before you spend ridiculous sums of money, keep reading through the reviews. And don't trust the title. Looks and books are deceiving!"
"749",748,"Ro Estanteria Compartida","No me ha convencido,ha tardado demasiado en arrancar y al final no me he sorprendido."
"750",749,"Adrienne Gomer","So corny and predictable. None of the characters were likeable. "
"751",750,"Tonya","Wow, this one isn't even worth finishing in my opinion. I stopped after 50 pages. The characters are all quite pathetic and certainly unlikeable. Reading this book is like watching Jerry Springer just so you can say ""Well, at least I 'm not that crazy/pathetic""."
"752",751,"Pearl","I really wanted to give the book star minus, but didn't know how to do it. I can't believe how popular this book is. It felt like the book would never end. "
"753",752,"Cory Gaskins","British xenophobia on full display.Despite the book not specifying any race (except for one guy), the film features an all-white cast except for a doctor ""who is Bosnian but could pass as an Indian"" (what?), which is coincidentally played by a latino actor. Why would a British novel ever feature a foreigner? Why, so he could play a guy that seemingly is cheating with a married woman. Perhaps Paula Hawkins is playing on the xenophobic British mindset's prejudice but seriously??? Nothing much has changed from Bridget Jone's Diary days when the only reason why a foreigner would appear is so they could play the villain. And before anyone accuses me of being a social justice warrior, I've complained about the same thing when BJ's Diary hit the cinema decades ago. I've lived in 8 countries or so in my life and the UK is a highly racist country and the novels coming from there displays this mindset."
"754",753,"Brooke Illich","I had a hard time getting through this book, it took so long for anything exciting to happen. I read it because it was compared to gone girl, which I enjoyed. However, I hated Gillian Flynn's other novels because they were very slow going until about 3 chapters from the end, this book was very much like that and I just couldn't wait for it to end."
"755",754,"Fiffer_feffer_feff","I was at the airport and considered buying this book but knew that I had already put a hold in at the library. So glad that I did not waste my money on this trash. Just as bad as the 50 Shades of Gray. Couldn't keep reading it. Life is too short to waste your time on reading crap."
"756",755,"Melanie","The story was not worth the language to me."
"759",758,"Charu Agrawal","NYT best seller....so disappointing. First of all I did not think it was a thriller....what is so thrilling about reading messed up characters and everyone sleeping with everyone ? I see lots of five star reviews of the book and I am sure people have liked it. I found it monotonous and more like an endless rant where you could already guess what was coming. An alcoholic woman and an ex wife, a psychotic and obsessed current wife and a strange neighbor who goes missing...if you couldn't guess what was coming and found it thrilling....I would say you and I have different definitions of thrill."
"761",760,"Carson","Disappointing. Builds well in the first act, but then the 2nd act devolves into lazy melodrama."
"762",761,"Deanaschenkgmail.com","I would give this book zero stars, if possible. Characters were both unlikable and impossible to relate to. Trite and clumsy plot line made me sorry I purchased the book. "
"765",764,"Reina","I always feel a little guilty when I don't finish a book. Not this time, I just feel relief that I can pick up a book with likeable characters now."
"766",765,"Mary Wagner","The characters were across the board unlikeable. I was not rooting for anyone, found portions predictable and clichéd, and only finished it because a book club chose it. By the end I was actually angry that I was spending my time reading it. "
"767",766,"Lucy Dixon","I was so looking forward to reading this book. What a waste of anticipation. "
"768",767,"Botao","Pure shit, even not a complete story, highly doubt the author's intention of writing this book."
"769",768,"Jacinta","Pure rubbish. "
"771",770,"Susanna","I really wasn't a fan, read it for a book club but it felt like it was trying too hard to be ""Gone Girl"" and in the end I felt like I was forcing myself to finish."
"772",771,"april","Probably one of the most annoying books I've ever had the chance to read. I don't usually consider any book a waste of time, but The Girl on the Train was actually a really boring and tiring book. I've finished in a week and during that week I would try to find different ways to spend my time, other than reading this crap.The plot twist was interesting, but the whole book was awful. The way it was written lacks of any talent and it made me want to set the book on fire. The title was the one that made me want to read this thing, but it turned out that the book has a stupid, alcooholic, no-chance-to-become-someone girl that develops an obsession with a couple she only sees when she travels to London (I think?) by train.Yeah, a-ma-zing.I would rather watch paint dry.One thing I really hate is that nowadays every journalist that took a creative writing class is considered a genius and his/her book becomes a bestseller. Really nice."
"773",772,"Kelsey Baldwin","Multiple people told me that this book was a ""must read."" Although I read to the end, I thought everything about it was depressing. "
"775",774,"Mary Ann","This book is just god awful depressing. For the life of me I can't figure out what all the hype is about. I'm so sorry I wasted my money to buy this trash. Wish I could get my money back. Who reads this sort of dribble and actually says this is good. I'm only 12% through this novel and I can't stomach reading another page. I thought Gone Girl was terrible too. I should have known better. "
"776",775,"Shelby P","The only reason I decided to read this book was because it won the Goodreads Choice Awards for Best Mystery. I guess if you want a buzz about your book you should put Girl in the title. I expect a good mystery to keep me on my toes and trying to figure out who done it instead of being bored to death. It was hard keeping the numerous characters straight. It was tedious reading about Rachel riding the train back and forth and drinking herself into a sad state. If I were the roommate Cathy, I'd have kicked that bitch out a long time ago.Another thing? Don't they have air conditioners in England? The trains were constantly hot and the apartments were constantly hot. What gives?This book took me a very long time to read and eventually I had to start skimming. Maybe it would have been better if it were edited to take all this useless shit out? My least favorite character was Anna. I wish (view spoiler)[ she'd ended up dead instead of Megan. She was despicable thinking it would be cool now if her husband got rid of Rachel. Did she really think he wouldn't eventually get rid of her as well? I really hate it when the bad guy dies in the end. Why couldn't Tom have gone to jail? I would have liked to read about Scott's reaction to Tom being the killer of his wife. Also who leaked the info to the cops about Megan and Mac having killed their baby? I don't think the shrink would have done that.  (hide spoiler)]"
"777",776,"Eileen Breseman","there was not a single character I could relate to nor sympathize with. A sad, egotystical, victimized lot- all of them. I felt the author wrote this to be made into another suspenseful but formulatic movie. I could guess the ending long before it came. Read something else, something worthwhile."
"782",781,"Lorena","Am I ready to write a review?I think I am. This book was boring as hell. The characters were so obnoxious and the story was pretty predictable. This is why I hate reading thrillers: I'm always hoping the author will develop the plot way different as what I think they will do, but no, they do the most predictable thing ever. Always. Also, the protagonist was a mess, not because she was a alcoholic but because she had such a low self love and self esteem. Ugh. This book wasn't about a mystery, this book was about self pity."
"783",782,"JENNIFER","So disappointed with this book. Terrible letdown."
"784",783,"angieboudreauxgmail.com","Not sure why I keep reading, but the book itself is not that great. The characters are unlikable and the time line is confusing."
"785",784,"Sharon Griffin","I couldn't get into this book. Very confusing and depressing."
"786",785,"Ramona","I couldn't get into the book at all. It was hard to be sympathetic towards any of the characters. At first I felt sorry for one of them, then all I could think about was how pathetic she truly was. They all were. Even the girl who died, I couldn't really care about her.Then I figured out the ""mystery"" about 2/3 through. After that, I really could care less. I only finished the book to confirm what I already knew. It just wasn't good for me like it was for so many others."
"789",788,"Tara Kay","Nope. Never again am I going to read a book that reads in its recommendation, ""If you liked Gone Girl, you'll like this...."" Because no. This is not even in the same arena as Gone Girl in terms of plot twist, character twists, and over all suspense. A blah in my book, a ""don't bother"" recommendation. "
"790",789,"Sanne","DNF around page 80.This book was awful. I do not understand the positive reviews, because there is nothing to be positive about? The main character is a creepy freak. The plot is slow; waaay toooo slooow, tbh. Maybe I'll just watch the film but I do not recommend this book at all."
"791",790,"Sarah Jane","I was disappointed in this book. Not worth your time and kind of sketch"
"792",791,"Meg Tong","Worst. Book. Ever. The main character is the worst kind of human being and her selfish ramblings make this book torturous. Just put this book down and walk away, you can thank me later."
"794",793,"Kaitlyn","Why in the world are there so many good reviews?! This was so depressing and so hard to get through. If I wasn't so obsessive about finishing every book I start, I would have put this down for good after 20%. "
"796",795,"Lesley","Maybe I've been spoiled by some really good mysteries where I was surprised by the whodunnit cause this one didn't do anything for me. Three whining sad-sack women, a handful of smarmy guys and I was just left wondering why they couldn't all have died."
"798",797,"Karatepop","Ugh. 100% Agree with Steffi's review. Everything is a cliche. If you are genuinely surprised by episodes of shows like Law & Order, this is for you. If you are DJ from Full House and you think it's your duty to serve a man, this is for you.I know I haven't read many, but I am not feeling the thrillers. There must be another way to write these. For real. "
"800",799,"Courtenay Wendell","Fun read....Not particularly well written or shocking. A good beach or airplane read. A quick page Turner and we fun read. "
"801",800,"Judith","Don't even start!"
"802",801,"Dianne Landry","I despair over the fact that this is one the those ""must reads"" like Gone Girl and 50 Shades of Grey because, like Gone Girl and 50 Shades of Grey it is a piece of complete and utter shite. The style is terrible, the main characters are completely unlikeable and the language usage is juvenile.I had only read 30 pages when I found myself thinking ""no wonder you got dumper you stupid, pathetic wimp"". I read 20 more pages and knew that like the other two this was unreadable.If you are someone who doesn't read a lot, you may like this, if you are someone who, like me, is an avid reader, especially of mysteries, don't waste your time, you'll never get it back."
"803",802,"Margaret","Formulaic creepily violent tripe. It's just not surprising anymore after a few of these books. If you want something much creepier and better, Our Endless Numbered Days packs a similar punch but is much more well written and plotted. "
"804",803,"Kathelijne","Much ado about nothing..."
"806",805,"Emily S","Couldn't finish it"
"807",806,"Charon Lloyd-Roberts","Well this was a fairly quick read but the story I found myself not being invested in this includes the characters so in a way due to that the story dragged on so I forced myself to finish this as quickly as possible just to see if anything would be resolved I would give this 3.5 stars its not the best the book out there mind you. But I think I'll stick with Dan Brown if I want a decent mystery/thriller book.Hopefully the next book Paula writes will be better."
"808",807,"Mona","Boring, stopped 3/4 of the way through. I didn't even care enough to finish."

"812",811,"bitmaid","Good grief. Haven't you heard ""don't speak if you don't have anything to say""? Get it together, seriously. The whole book is poorly organized with verbiage - a try-hard attempting to look effortless. "
"813",812,"★Ruth★","Unfortunately I can't jump on this bandwagon :(This was just so depressing and all the characters were so unlikeable. There was just nothing about it that appealed to me apart from the mystery that I just had to know....cause I'm like that! So ensued a lot of skimming and frustration of having to skim back & read properly etc etc!!!"
"816",815,"Ankit Vishwakarma","I actually forced myself to finish this book as soon as possible. Not because it was interesting. Not because it was ""un-put-down-able"". But because I didn't want to deal with it any longer.I mean this book is just pathetic. Lame-ass, cover to cover. 3.84 average rating? Are you fucking kidding?Seriously, DO NOT waste your time on this."
"818",817,"Jessica Killingbeck","First, to say this book is a ""psychological thriller"" is untrue. To lump it in with other books like The Likeness (Tana French) or Gone Girl is an insult to the authors who wrote those books. This one was more of a mix between a poorly written mystery and a chick novel about a mess of woman who is still in love with her ex-husband, who has a mess of a new wife. All the characters in the story are at least a little bit crazy, if not full blown insane. I couldn't find any one character in the book that I liked. I'm not sure why so many people love this book; perhaps they haven't read actual good books prior to this one? Whatever the reason, I clearly don't see the attraction and don't understand why this is worth reading."
"819",818,"Tina Price","Not for me. The characters were unsympathetic and disagreeable and the action clunky. "
"820",819,"Denise Going","I didn't finish. Reading about misery without relief - even with crime suspense - not interested. "
"821",820,"Pablo Soler","WHAT A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.!!!! maybe it will be a good movie like gone girl (the original concept of this book)... because this book is far from great!"

"827",826,"Meg","I hated this story. I had to force myself to finish reading it. So depressing, from start to finish - an alcoholic, a liar, and adulterer, a murderer - it's a dog's breakfast the whole way through. Some reviews had likened it to ""Gone Girl"", and I can see those similarities, but ""Girl on the Train"" has no twists."

"832",831,"Marilyn","Ugh. Completely lacking in anything that makes a book redeemable. I got caught up in the hype, and when someone compared it to a Hitchcock movie, I bought. The writing was flat, the characters were all weenies, and I figured out who dun it before halftime. Sleazy language. I should have aborted. Consider yourself warned. Off to read some Anna Quindlen and remember why I should stick to good writing."
"834",833,"Teri","Weird waste of time."
"836",835,"Dru","Really hard to care about any of the characters in this book. Every time I put it down it was a struggle to pick it back up. "
"837",836,"Valentina Gregianin","awful"
"838",837,"Kcoloney","I read the first 30 or so pages and NOTHING happened other than she rode the train. Add that to the fact that I hated the writing style, and it was easy for me to decide to move on to a more enjoyable book. Having made that decision, I read the last 2 pages and that validated my decision: if I had persevered thru the whole book and got to THAT ending I would have been really mad!"
"839",838,"Jojo Cho","SKIP: So much raving about how good this book was... I was disappointed. Nonetheless, I speed read it. I have no sympathy for any of the characters. Everyone was a manipulator, liar, and cheat! So what to like about? There got to be a dimlight of hope despite darkness in humanity..."
"840",839,"Kristen Lemaster","I'm really good at not overestimating a novel but was still severely underwhelmed by this book after all the hype it's received. Three things I instantly disliked: 1 the first 100 pages or so are attempts at cheap trickery, that anybody who has read a few mystery/thriller novels can easily see through; 2 one of the current movements in contemporary literature is this idea of characters whom we don't have to ""like"" or ""relate to,"" but these characters are just boring to read about - melodramatic and emotional without inspiring empathy, and especially in terms of the women, with indistinct narrative voices that blur together (maybe smarter to have written in third person?) ; and 3 despite so many comparisons to Gone Girl, the gorgeous, captivating exploration of the dark side of human nature is almost non-existent here. Ultimately, it reads like a bundle of descriptive cliches, poor character development, plot devices, and misinterpretations of love."
"841",840,"Corina","What a train wreck, from start to finish. All three women were one ugly mess. Don't understand the need for this book. On to a more promising book."
"843",842,"Stacey","Trying desperately to get through this book but it is so hard. I am not feeling any connection to these characters and I am so bored and not enthused at all to read. Ugh, I love reading!Ok, finished this book and I still don't like it. Took me weeks to finish because I just hated it so much. She never helps you like or connect with any of the characters. I just don't get the hype. "
"844",843,"Shana McK","I wanted to like this book. But in the end, I hated it. If you're looking for the next Gone Girl, skip this and keep looking.First, Rachel is not a convincing alcoholic. The writing is WAY too controlled for an alcoholic, she sounds way to reasonable. And you never get to *see* and *feel* her being out of control, which is a major fault in the book. I've known alcoholics and none of them were this controlled.Two, none of the central characters has a depth that really makes them interesting. They are all deeply flawed people -- and you don't care about them. I felt absolutely zero sympathy for any of them.Three, this is a feminist nightmare. All of the women think that to be single is The Worst Most Terrible Thing Ever. Gag. Even staying with a man that is clearly abusive or manipulative? That's OK, because ""it's better than being single!"" And, every woman is a victim of a man. Fourth, why there is so much exposition is beyond me. I'm not against it, but it creates and maintains distance with the reader. That so much distance exists is a feat, given this is told from multiple first-person POVs.I recommend avoiding this book. If you want to read about flawed female protagonists, even those who do Bad Things, read Emily Barr. She does it so, so much better (and you really care about the characters). Hawkins is trying to write like Barr, but she fails miserably."

"848",847,"Bhammary","what a boring book."
"849",848,"Nicolette","This book kind of left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I didn't like it at all. The story is told by such a depressing figure that has nothing in life and basically stalks other people who actually try and make something of theirs. I don't know why this book is such a hype these days but there are so many other good books. I finished it but would not recommend it to anyone else. "

I do not ask for much in my beach reads: plot, some coherent writing, character development. I gave this book more than a fair shot. But I'm stopping at page 175.Poor writing, flat characters, and the author's sexist tone seeps off every page. Every female psychosis is on display here: dressing the part, feeling worthless, feeling like a child, sexual motivation behind how men act, women's revenge, ""I'm a force to be reckoned with,"" ""all these men,"" the list goes on.... I can't take it anymore. Life is too short to read bad books like this one. I hate it1/5 Goodreads1/5 Amazon"
"853",852,"Gabrielle-Ann Torre","This book is so awful that I feel the need to review it. Voyeurism, drug abuse, and domestic violence have never felt so trite than in Hawkins' debut novel. The main characters, three women, are supposedly distinct females who are instead shapeless stand-ins for an overarching cliched metaphor for 'female purpose,' or so the writing seems to purport. Each woman is fraught with some pitiful excuse of purposelessness in life: Rachel is a lost alcoholic, Anna is an obsessed mistress, and Megan is a grieving wife. Most unfortunately, the woes of these women are at the behest of men, who are bestowed little depth by Hawkins' lackadaisical characterization efforts. Why are Tom and Scott both so needlessly aggressive? Why do the men have to lie and cheat? Why do these actions dismantle our supposed heroines? The novel implies that women are weakened by men, or that--once 'weakened'-- selfish irrational acts are justifiable when you're a drunk divorcee. There is no redemption for any of the women, and I felt empathy for none of them throughout the book. Kind of hard to care when murder is how you win in the end.What is this book supposed to be about? In the few hours it took me to read, I grappled with potential themes by the hand of Hawkins, but the plot and writing lack the clarity and novelty that would permit the book to serve a moralistic purpose. The notion of being ""the girl on the train"" watching literal and metaphorical fragments of life flicker by is romantic and somewhat appealing yet manages to falter chapter by chapter. Not worth reading."
"854",853,"Susan  Tracy","Could not finish this book. I made it about 1/3 thru it and had to give up. there was nothing about the characters that I could find likable and the story was just not interesting enough. Nor did I care about how things ended up. So disappointing for a book that had such high expectations."
"857",856,"Vanessa / Little Gold Pixel","After finishing about 30% of this book I decided that life was too short to read books that I'm not enjoying.Everything was unnecessarily bleak and not in a poetic way. Just ... ugh. I could see the wheels turning, and I knew exactly how this was going to play out. No thanks."
"858",857,"Geneva Wilson","Listened to the audiobook. The narrator made the lead sound very very very whiny."
"860",859,"Belinda Kirkwood","Although the premise of being drawn into a place that you watch from a train is good, and the ending worked, I found the book vacuous and boring."
"861",860,"Joanie Pariera","Hyped. Been wanting to read this forever but didn't find it as good as I was told it is. The story is tragic, no doubt, but in the end it becomes predictable. What's worse is that the women are all painted as having homogenous emotions around the one aim of holding on to that one special guy! 'The Girl on The Train' is in the end just a story about love and lust. Moral -'Don't drink and do anything, let alone take the train that goes by your ex's house every day' "
"863",862,"Manda Chittles","I was so disappointed with this novel. I am really surprised at how popular it is. While I have read worse, the writing isn't particularly good and the ending is utterly predictable. You can readily identify the 'bad guy' about half way through. For the most part I found sections of the book to alternate between frustrating and boring. The characters have no depth and are really too stupid to be believable. Overall - I wouldn't recommend it."
"865",864,"Joanne","Hated the main characters. The whole thing keep getting more tedious, rather than more interesting. Didn't bother to finish. "
"866",865,"Brittney","After finishing this book I'm surprised that so many people gave it 3 stars or more. I had to literally force myself to finish it if just for the sake of completing my reading challenge. Every single character seemed to having nothing likable about them at all. I do believe that a good character must have a fatal flaw or two, but come on! This was overboard! Everyone was utterly depressing and while the author provided first-person insight into three main characters, I still couldn't find anything to like about them. They were not relatable, they did not have skills of any kind, a hobby, or even self-respect. And the plot! That was just one of the worst aspects. The synopsis makes you think that something horrific happened, which was what made me pick up the book in the first place, only to provide the biggest let-down ever. I also did not like the time stamps at the beginning of every chapter either. To be honest, it tripped me up since the three POVs happened at almost completely different times. I had to keep looking back to keep track of who was when. It became painfully tedious. The author could have easily snuck in the passage of time in the narration. There was an aspect to Hawkins' writing that also made me uncomfortable. If something important happened that included someone she did not want to mention just yet, she used he and she, even when it made literally no sense. If there was another person involved too it made me think she was talking about them when she wasn't. Now that's just bad writing, in my opinion.Overall, I would not recommend this book to anyone. There was nothing psychological or suspenseful about it. It's very predictable and, unfortunately, a drag."
"867",866,"Jennifer Bolster","I hated this book. I was told it was comparable to Gone Girl, it didn't come close. I had to force myself to finish it to find out the ending, which by the way, was predicted by about 1/4 into the book."
"869",868,"Sara Arthrell","3/4 of the book is focused solely on what a raging alcoholic she is...where I was often skimming pages just to get through yet another one of her collapses. This book was an obvious copy of Gone Girl but without any redeeming qualities. I'm sorry I wasted time and money with this one. "
"870",869,"Louise","If you are nostalgic for bland nineties movie 'thrillers', this is the book for you! "
"871",870,"ao","Non mi è piaciuto. La storia è morbosa e artificiosa, di cattivo gusto."
"873",872,"Linda Hali","This is the only audible novel I have ever returned. I listened while driving for about 4 hours and realized it made me miserable. The main character is vaguely stalking her husband and new wide/ child, there are unhappy mentally unsure neighbors, a murder, and said stalkers protagonist is unsure of her involvement due to alcoholism and blackouts. The only interesting premise, and best writing, is in the initial experience of watching townhouses from a train and naming the people and imagining their lives. The rest is a jump on the ""gone girl"" marriage gone south, unhappy people , unlikable ensemble,bad behavior as suspense band wagon. I left a star because I think the craft of writing is so complex and there is a glimmer of character and plot here, just not realized."
"875",874,"Agaughan68","I don't understand the hullaballoo about this book. I didn't care for it. I didn't like the fact that three people were telling the story. I also don't like stories that do not go in chronological order. I was not surprised by the killer. I kind of guessed it was him since he was a cheater once, he would do it again. Not a book that I would recommend to anyone. It was not a difficult book; it was just a difficult book for me to read (I thought it was that I was sick and fell asleep a lot--no, it was this book.)"

"880",879,"Vittoria Giordano","Ho fatto davvero uno sforzo a finire questo libro, e l'ho fatto nella speranza che il finale mi avrebbe convinta al punto da farmelo piacere. Purtroppo, sinceramente, questo non è successo, anzi. Il finale l'ho trovato ancora più terribile del resto: ad un certo punto del libro era diventato già scontato. Non è stato un boom di sorpresa, per nulla. I personaggi sono odiosi, la protagonista è deprimente e quantomeno mi sarei aspettata, col finale, di vedere una Rachel cambiata e un po' più soddisfatta di se stessa. E invece non c'è stato una così grande evoluzione del personaggio, quindi mi chiedo: che senso ha avuto l'intero libro? Credo sia davvero la primissima volta in cui un libro non mi è piaciuto e non rileggerei. "
"881",880,"Geraldine Macci","I feel much the same way about Gone Girl as I did about this: I hated it. I hated the characters, they're all horrible people. All of them. The story wasn't enough and just felt awful. Well written, I suppose, but definitely not for me. "
"882",881,"Gaile","I have no idea why this is a best seller."
"884",883,"Alex","Like Gone Girl, but less well written and less exciting.I read this book really quickly because I wanted to see how things resolved themselves.I think one of you read this book earlier this year, but I'll summarize it briefly anyway. It's about a woman who's an alcoholic and rides the train daily, always keeping an eye out of this couple about whom she's constructed an elaborate back story. One day, the woman goes missing and the main character keeps thinking she saw something, but was also blackout drunk and no one really believes her. They all think she's kind of ""mental"" (BRITISH BOOK) and not to be trusted, plus she is always pissed (BRITISH BOOK). British Score: 10/10, I was needing an interpreter at this point but now I can speak British! Overall: 5/10, IDK this was kind of a boring book. It was overhyped - I expected a lot more, so maybe i'm just disappointed.I need a new book to read!!! I am going to make a list of best and worst books i read this year! YAY!Ali, your return is marked on my calendar and I CANT WAIT!"

"887",886,"Crystal Thomas rodriguez","Painfully slow. Figured out what was going on halfway into the book. I don't understand the hype, at all."
"888",887,"Mallika","I really can't understand how/why this book is receiving 5-star ratings, because the writing, plot and especially the characters were horrifying and atrocious. Another reader described this book and its characters to be one big ""hot mess"", and I think that is single-handedly the best description for this book. I suppose the suspense and mystery makes it for an easy read for people who don't read at all that much. But to other well-seasoned readers – do not give into the hype. Read another book. Save your time and your inner sense of peace, because all you want to do is fling this book (or Kindle) at the wall once you are done with it."
"889",888,"Corie","I guess not liking Gone Girl should have been my fist warning. The book was okay for a while, but I lost interest about half way trough, and then found the ending to be horrible."
"890",889,"Carlissa","I got up to chapter 16 and quit. The story was extremely boring, nothing happening at all! Maybe I was expecting too much since there are so many good reviews, but this just isn't my cuppa tea. The narrators were okay, so it wasn't that."
"891",890,"Darlene","In this horror story three emotionally-warped narrating wives and their husbands do a danse macabre. Whodunit? Who cares??"
"892",891,"Cristina","I put it down for almost a whole month, it was so boring. Rachel was a disgusting and pathetic character in the beginning, which made the book unbearable to read. I finally picked it up again and had to skim after 30% just to keep my sanity."
"893",892,"Roy Matsunaga","I would not recommend this book to anyone. I don't understand how it is one of the most popular books on goodreads."
"894",893,"Jonette","I read Gone Girl and loved it. This is no Gone Girl. Poor character development and the story line so riddled with ""coincidences"" that make the entire story ludicrous. Not one single likable character in the entire book. I simply cannot believe I finished reading it. It made me angry that I wasted my time. "
"895",894,"Kalinda","Terribly drawn characters, predictable mystery. Generally awful."

"900",899,"Marcella Phillips hill","Pathetic characters! I lived through my ex having an affair and I sincerly hope that no one is as pathetic as the main character. I want to ask, who the heck does the author hang out with? All the women I know that have been through divorce, abuse, addiction, death, are all stronger than they were prior. really discouraging to think this level of patheticness exists."
"902",901,"Colette Dever","A disappointing read that doesn't come close to meeting its hype. Perhaps the fact that the movie rights have already been optioned explains the book's heavy promotion, because it certainly isn't warranted by the weak story."
"904",903,"Trisha Ta","The book jumped from event to event and I got lost a couple of times so I had to reread some pages. The main character, Rachel, was married to Tom but then left her for another women which is how her drinking problem came along. She drinks so much that she'll black out, harass her ex-husband over the phone and even in person. Since she became an alcoholic she is unemployed but to pass time rides the train and fantasizes about a married couple who lived only a couple houses down from Tom. She imagines them as ""perfect"" but in reality aren't. The couples wife's name is Megan and is in an unhappy marriage. After a series of events Megan winds murdered by Tom because she was pregnant with his child and was having an affair with Anna (current wife). Rachel stabs Tom with a corkscrew and her and Anna coordinate stories to make it self-defense. I really didn't like this book because it kept jumping around in the beginning but started making sense in the end. Rachel was an interesting character, I liked that it was in her pov because of how she was always drinking which made it confusing. She was a perfect character, showing how she was the crazy one in the beginning but in the end wasn't. "

"909",908,"Pigstar116","Approx 5 characters in this book 3 of which you know aren't the killer......this is amateur writing / plot line at best. Author also made all women characters weak and pathetic and dependent on men and catty to each other and nothing more than that. Dislike. Don't understand the 5 star ratings. "
"910",909,"MGE.Dee","I just thought I would add that this is not a book for anyone. I heard so many great things about the book and unless you lead a well balanced life and hardly ever lonely, you might stomach it. Ironically this adds to the merits of the book because Hawkins ability to draw loneliness, rejection and shame is unparalleled. The emotions of the lead character, her frustrations of being alone, her obsession with pain and her escapism into the lives of other to compensate for a lack of connection was just too much for me. The emotions are extremely raw. I listened to the book on my way to work this morning at 7 am and it literally destroyed my mood. It's 6 pm right now and I still can't forget the characters. I just thought it's worth warning others about how depressing it can be. "

Vurgulanan detaylardan ve GİZEM diye inatla altı çizilen soru işaretinin peşine sayfaları kovaladım ancak sona ulaştığımda elimde kalan gerçeklik o kadar sıradandı ki ""ama"" demekten kendimi alamadım. Evlilikleri güzel olan ama mutsuz kadınlar, evliliği güzel görünüp mutsuz olan kadınlar, evliliği kötü sonuçlanmış mutsuz kadınlar, herkes ve her şey mutsuz, çöküntü içinde.. Belki de benim bu kadar zayıf karakterli olunmasını sevmememdendir bilemiyorum. Kitapta tek sevdiğim nokta bölümlerin akşam ve sabah olarak bölünmesiydi, tren yolculuğundaki anları yaşıyorduk ancak o da sonradan değişerek amacının dışına çıktı. "
"912",911,"Judy Yarborough","I'm so sorry I ever bothered borrowing this audiobook. I could only ""read"" a little more than halfway thru.

Don't waste your time. This book is best suited to the rubbish bin. "

"916",915,"Autumn Meier","Hated, hated, hated it. Every character is basically the worst person you've ever met. And it's not an interesting ""character study,"" okay, it's just annoying. The dialog reads like a bad soap opera, the plot is predictable, and, yeah, surprise, it's a Gone Girl knock off. I was on a month-long waiting list for this book; I wanted it to be good. Nope. Very disappointing. "
"917",916,"Sue  (Bedazzled By Books)","This book was a huge disappointment. I would have marked it as DNF after reading the first few chapters except that a friend gave me the book to read and said they loved it, so I pushed myself to read it all the way through.There is nothing outstanding about this book. The writing was below average, uninteresting, disjointed and didn’t flow well. It was quite confusing as to which character was being written about and there was lots of capricious jumping between the past and present.All three female main characters were unlikeable and I could not feel an ounce of empathy toward any of them no matter what had happened to them in their past or what was currently happening to them. They were inconsistent, whiny, pathetic women being controlled by the men in their lives.The idea of the story sounded intriguing, but it turned out that it wasn’t even a tantalising mystery or “who dunnit”, and it wasn’t long into the book before I had it all worked out. No suspense or psychological thrills here.I really don’t understand all the hype surrounding this book, and I cannot imagine why anyone would want to turn it into a movie. This book served as a good reminder to me why I don’t usually read adult fiction and prefer reading young adult books."
"918",917,"Bonnie","Where to start. Horrible story about sad people, a real downer. How did this book receive all the hype? I guess publishing is aimed at the lowest levels now. I felt terrible after finishing this book."

"922",921,"Fiona","The first half of the book is just plain boring and a drag...so much so that I had to really coax myself to go on reading the book. The plot (if you may so call it) unfurls only in the later half of the book and is completely predictable.Some of the characters and situations had no role to play in the 'plot'. For example, Rachel's sessions with the therapist just added a few more pages of reading, nothing else. Rachel's character is unbelievable - a drunkard who tries to solve a murder mystery on her own, on the basis of lies and knowing very well that she just can't remember anything from when she was drunk. The book is not worth the time at all."

"932",931,"Christine Marquis","Predictable and boring. I had to force myself to read this. I don't understand how it has such a high rating. It is not suspenseful nor trilling. The woman in the book is weird and crazy (and so are all the other characters). I would not recommend this book to anyone. "
"933",932,"Anthony Dalton","Oh so ordinary and disappointing.The writing style was somewhat simplistic and ever so monotonous . Despite the varying narratives, all in first person from different characters, each presented as the same personality, a result of the under developed style of writing. This also impacted on the character development, I was able to empathise with Rachel to a degree, but Anne and Megan were nothing more than mono dimensional entities who despite being supposed significant characters, are so devoid of substance or depth I couldn't have cared less about them. This novel sadly is a triumph for the marketing machinations behind it and a slap in the face to the discerning reader. "
"934",933,"Lotte North","Quite possibly the worst book I have ever read. Bland, lifeless and dull. Characters are just merely names who narrate their lives step by step. There is utterly no inference required by the reader, and absolutely no visual image of the characters/settings due to non-existent description. Terrible. Purely a book written to be made into a crap film."
"935",934,"Mich","I found this book to be dull and repetitive. I kept thinking there must be an amazing twist at the end to make up for the tedious build up. Instead, it was really predictable. I disliked the cliche James-Bond-villain style speech at the end. The male characters are either physically violent or sexually exploitative and the female characters fit into one of two moulds: seductive temptress or tired, fat mum! The characters were underdeveloped and unlikeable. I can't see what the fuss is about."

At about page 50, when it became all too clear how this was to pan out, I let my husband read from a page. He looked at me, surprised that this book was on my shelf. And I cannot even blame my reading group on this one, as I could with the Dan Brown read I had to do about a decade ago. I am a prose snob. I enjoy character driven books as long as the characters are interesting. The characters aboard this train wreck were all shells of ideas with no real effort to give them flesh. Makes me wish I had not trusted Goodreads for its recommendations."

Scott and Tom were boring. Anna was a robot. Even the baby was boring. What tf did the weird smiley ginger man have to do with anything? He was boring too.Side note: the whole book was pretty much Rachel trying to piece together her black-out drunk moments. No thanks"

I don't have to like the characters to get into a book, or agree with their actions, but I at least have to care a little about them. I cared about nothing in this book. I hoped a nuclear bomb would come through in the end and take care of the whole lot of them. I enjoy a good mystery and love dysfunctional people but nope. I can't fathom how this got the reviews it got. I'm mad I wasted my time reading it, as I had been looking forward to reading it "

"946",945,"Jim McPherson","Got this for the cover raves. Have to say it was very poor, a bad soap opera with three remarkably similar and exceedingly unsympathetic protagonists all speaking in the first person. I have enough trouble with one person speaking in the first person but three? If this is the future of writing, bring back the past. To describe this as Hitchcockian is as good as admitting never seeing a Hitchcock. Unless the Hitchcock isn't Alfred of course. As a whodunit, well, who didn't ... other than the red herring(s)? Enough said."

"948",947,"Joan","Disappointing. Written like Gone Girl, in 1st person. Too much inner thinking. Back & forth between characters exhausting to read. Characters are all psychos! None of them likable. Ending predictable."
"949",948,"Kayla Steade","Tons of great reviews on this book..I was super stoked to read it and stayed up until 3am doing so and it was terrible. This book is 323 pages long and doesn't get interesting until about page 150. The protagonist is some washed up, alcoholic divorcee who is obsessed with her ex husband and new wife. Majority of the book is her getting drunk, blacking out and not remembering anything. Then some women she sees daily on her train excursions goes missing, and she plays Nancy Drew trying to solve the crime. I also figured it out what happened and ""who done it"" midway through the book. Long story short, waste of time. Don't read it."
"950",949,"EDian","Touted as the next Gone Girl, this book missed the mark. I hated the characters. Maybe they were too British for me. I thought the plot really dragged and lacked imagination. Mid way through the book I wished all the characters as slow and painful death as I was experiencing by reading this stupid book."
"951",950,"Devin","Alright, I am going to put something out there that will not be popular. I really disliked this book. The narrator is incredibly annoying, and she dwells on her pathetic-ness endlessly for the entire book. On top of that I found the whole premiss a little too... sad... for my own taste. A woman is so unhappy with her life that she images perfect lives for the people she passes on the train everyday. When a woman that she sees regularly goes missing our narrator inserts herself into the investigation to find her, and discovers that she may know more than she originally thought. This is a bestselling novel, so obviously some people like it. However, I am not one of them. Moving on. "
"952",951,"Filiz","Yes, it's a page turner (fairly good suspense, red herrings and requisite female corpse(beautiful). But it's also a page skimmer, I'd say about 20% could have been edited out w/o problem). Fails to achieve true psychological depth or linguistic distinctiveness (the three female narrators are indistinct). Still, good entertainment, probably will be a better movie. "
"953",952,"Yasmin M","I can't even be bothered to write a derisive intro to my review, so here we are:This book is terrible. The characters are the worst set of human beings ever expressed in literature. They're terrible people with terrible lives and never-ending shitty decisions. I was uncomfortable reading this portrayal of alcoholism, cheating, murder, and failure. Does the author have no sense of fairness? Does she truly think that she has related a logical or believable tale? Even if her characters are purposefully horrendous; what kind of person is so bleak as to create a situation/murder/plot where everyone is bad, continues to be bad, and remains bad?? Woman, you need to have some faith; this assumed cynicism (and that's coming from me, for fuck's sake) truly weakens your entire credibility and places so much more pressure on your plot to be a perfect counterbalance WHICH IT ISN'T BY THE WAY. I started reading this novel, I became uncomfortable slipping into the routine of the characters, their thoughts and their encounters, but I carried on anyway in hopes that maybe, just maybe, the plot would pick up or the mystery would unfold into some shocking twist that would then explain the prevailing dreadfulness of the book's plot, setting, events, characters..etc. What I ended up with, however, was a sordid, anti-climactic (if there ever was a climax even) ending and a terribly predictable murder mystery. The author's plain/bland writing did nothing to help, the jump from one hateful character's point of view to the next only made it more difficult to go on, the weak plot and incredibly slow pace right down to the end made me wish I didn't have so much free time on my hands, but most of all, the unnecessary and, in my opinion, very unrealistic bleakness (as I've already mentioned) really pissed me off. Because why did she even fucking write the book to begin with? I, too, could write a book where all the characters are horrible, end up getting slaughtered and then have their bits and pieces thrown into a fan in outer space but WHY WOULD I?!! Call me old fashioned, but books should have purpose. Or at least beautiful writing to make up for all the other lacking fields.I'm not going to comment on the fact that people are raving about this book because I'm used to this alien spectacle on goodreads by now, but I remain utterly in awe of the fact nonetheless."
"954",953,"Reshma","This book had few redeeming qualities for me. I wish I'd read the review that said the book is ""not for people who read'. Every character was awful and the main was the worst. Bad decision after bad decision became trying. What makes me most angry is anyone who claims this is like Gone Girl, which I thought was a fantastic and well-written thriller."
"955",954,"Lola Williams","In my top 10 worst books I have ever read. I really don't understand the appeal of this book. The story line and characters were woeful. Nope."

"957",956,"Tom","Gone Girl lite....realllly lite. "
"958",957,"Peggy Herbert","People were talking about this book so I started listening to it. I wasn't really enjoying it and as the story went on, I started thinking how much it remeinded me of Gone Girl which I hated. Then I started reading the reviews and saw that it was being talked about as the next Gone Girl. So I popped out the CD, and returned it to the library. "
"959",958,"Brian Wilcox","The story itself is mildly entertaining, but the prose is weak and the characters are so unlikeable as to make reading a chore. I finished only because I did want to see how she would tie things up. Even that was an anticlimax."
"960",959,"Saturnberry","wow! this book is bad! I feel embarrassed for having read it! the first 2 available blurbs are mysterious enough, but unfortunately for me, that's where the intrigue stopped. I don't think there's a likeable character in this book. @.@ if the editor stripped out the main character's alcoholic binges, half the pages would be missing! the main character also seems to be an idiot! in the middle of the book, I lost interest and thought maybe i should look up who-dunnit on wiki to spare myself the binges and all-'round atrocious behavior. If anyone posts a count/ list of binges or how many times the main character gets sick or says she shouldn't, but does anyway, let me know! (oh! also- I wonder if there's a count on how many lies are being told by each character? do people really act like this? ) lol"

"962",961,"Cori","I cannot figure out why this book is popular. I can't stand any of the characters, I wish there were more casualties and maybe take out houses too so nothing would be left of those miserable people. Painful."
"963",962,"Yiqiu","tedious, misogynist, repetitive. The book being published is the ninth wonder in the world. To say it is stupid is to insult the word stupid."
"964",963,"Barbara Dowling","Erm, why is this book so popular? Started off promisingly enough, but swiftly descended into pure farce - an unbelievable plot to the point of being ridiculous in places. It contains every cliche going, and I found myself chuckling along with it. Suspense and thrill, not at all. I frankly didn't care by the end who had 'dunnit' as the plot limped towards its inevitable conclusion. "

"967",966,"Cory","So many things to dislike about this book: the horrible women, the horrible men, the tawdry plot... For a much more well-crafted take on domestic violence I recommend Liane Moriarty's Little Big Lies, which is fantastic and (to me) every bit as ""exciting"" without the misogyny. "
"969",968,"Joan Salvaggio","I have to say the ending was good. I recommend that if you read this book ... Read about a fourth to get to know the characters then go to almost the end and you will get the jest of the story. Not my kind of a mystery. Give me a Mary Higgins Clark any day. That is a page turner?!!?!"

"974",973,"Kimgertz","What a complete waste of a few hours. Saw that this book was ranked first on the New York Times list, and was taking a train trip in England, so I figured it would be the perfect reading companion for the journey. Wrong! First, I wasn't captivated by the plot until 2/3 through the book, and second, ALL of the characters in this book--from the victim, to the villains, to the ""heroines"" are detestable creatures, and I never gained any empathy for them. Back to the classics for me! "
"975",974,"Roger","Had to quit after the first 50 pages. What a waste of paper! Can't understand why it received so many high ratings. I can handle trashy as well as the next person but this is beyond. Why was this written?"
"976",975,"Stephanie Reid","Didn't enjoy this book at all, but I prefer more thrill and excitement rather than character development in the books I read. Things only got exciting in the final 4 chapters or so, and even then, the ending was incredibly predictable. Really disappointed as there are many 5 star reviews for this book. "
"977",976,"Robert Schlackman","This book really sucked. I kept hoping that all the characters would be thrown off a building and impaled on a fence because this is the only way the book could have ended that would have been satisfying. "
"979",978,"T.J. Madden","DerailedI am a serious consumer of police procedurals, thrillers, espionage, and adventure stories, so I dove into this story expecting to add another author to my list of favorites. The setup was intriguing. After a very few pages, however, I found myself wondering what was who, who was where, how the protagonists were going to get somewhere, and why did I care. I found this story redundant and repetitive; it kept saying the same things about the same characters over and over (not to over-emphasize, or anything).Without spoiling the trite ending, I had the bad guy ID'd early on, but I kept reading to the halfway point just to make sure. Nobody comes off well in this story: the men are one-dimensional and unsympathetic, not to say pathetic, psychotic, or pathologic; the women are either dypsomaniac, nymphomaniac, or just plain blind. The ""detectives"" are cutouts, and the only device that works in this dreary tale is the corkscrew.This ""psychological mystery"" is neither."
"980",979,"Gail Delong","Horrible, depressing, waste of time. I can think of nothing more revolting than pages and pages of the minute by minute detail of an alcoholic narcissist. There are so many holes in this book, I could use it as a colander. Don't waste your time. "
"981",980,"Tiffany","What the heck?? Publicist is doing a great job to get such a terrible book so much press. Hailing this thing as the next ""Gone Girl"" is an insult. Yes, there's suspense, but the author drags it out for entirely too long without any discernable reason why. All the characters are (slightly to very) crazy and also completely unlikable. The killer reveal felt like it was more as a ""gotcha"" then adding anything to the story. Disappointing read and a waste of time."
"982",981,"Paige Turner","Blech! I rarely not finish a book. This was one of the times I didn't. I cannot fathom why this book got so many high ratings and won the Goodreads 2015 award for best book in the mystery category. People sure have diffrent tastes, I'll say that."
"983",982,"Wally Cwik","Did not enjoy this book at all. Could not understand what all the hype was about the book. Although I enjoy authors who ply around with timelines, the story arc was confusing."
"984",983,"Ina","Tittelen burde heller ha vært ""Dramadronningen på toget"". Den mest masete boka jeg har lest så langt i år og syns ikke det var så overraskende og oppslukende som mange andre synes boka er. Skjønner meg vel ikke på bestselgere, haha ... Savner å bli overrasket og underholdt."
"987",986,"Betty410","It is hard for me to understand why this story was on the Best Seller list,Although I did not read beyond 75 pages except to browse ahead and read the last few pages there was nothing positive about the lives of these characters. Maybe some would appreciate the negativity, hopelessness and utter failure to adjust or compensate to life's experiences, I did not."
"989",988,"Christy Rivers","I read 66% of this book and then just couldn't make myself do it anymore- even for bookclub. I found it boring from the beginning and didn't care enough about any character to find out what happened. The plot wasn't interesting enough to me to care what happened at the end. I have tried to read spoilers, to learn how it ends for book club, and even now that I have some idea what happens, I really don't care. I also disliked Gone Girl but at least was interested in getting to the end to see how it all played out. This book was just a waste of time."

"992",991,"Mary Moore","Hype sells! This book was predictable and definitely not worthy of the publicity!"

"995",994,"Artemis K","I did not enjoy this book at all. I felt absolutely no sympathy towards the main character and the other characters fell flat for me. Do not recommend."

"997",996,"Kokie","After all the hype I was really excited to give this book a try. I almost put it down more than once, but was encouraged to finish by my friends. I couldn't connect with any of the characters, and the plot twists seemed obviously contrived. I'm disappointed it didn't grab me as it did so many others."

"1003",1002,"Nimrodel","I simply didn't like it. But there's a lot of things I want to say about this book. I summarize them below:1)Rachel is a character that gave me mixed feelings: at the beginning I despised her for being such a meddler, then I pitied her because of her drinking problem, and finally in the end I ended up liking her because she turned out to be a kind of anti-heroine in this horrible story.2)Why horrible story? (view spoiler)[If there’s anything I hate most is domestic abuse (verbal and physical), abusive men, and gender violence. Not to mention that I hate femicide and the typical machos(Sp.) strong as bulls that believe they can do as they please. So I think you can guess the opinion I have of Scott and Tom. (hide spoiler)]3)There’s no Hitchcockian thriller in delaying the topic/development of a story.4) I don't think I'm going to read any similar story 
EVER AGAIN
."
"1005",1004,"Sophie","This book was ""meh"" for me. It could have been great, I liked the story, the setting and the train, but I just could not stand the characters! I wanted to kick Rachel's ass and Anna's face (yes I know I get violent when facing weak and whiny characters). This spoiled it for me, but I totally understand that people who are not exasperated as much as I was by the characters love this book."
"1006",1005,"Boaz Gavish","Absolutely awful. Horrible character development, pathetic story, excrutuating read."
"1007",1006,"Martin Sørensen","I spent almost 2 months trying to read this, every time it was like going to a tedious boring job. The characters were completely 1 dimensional and almost caricatures of themselves. Worst of all there was no feeling of mystery, no hook. This was what should drive ever mystery/thriller book, but was completely absent from this particular work. All the book was about is a woman thinking and talking to herself while riding on the train or getting pissed in pubs, zero action. Maybe women will find this a more interesting book, im pretty sure most of my guy friends will find the lack of action or an actual plot, booring. Im not saying this in a sexist way, just the fact that many women can enjoy a more introspect slow paced view into the mind than atleast I do. But since this is my review i have to rate it as I see it: 1 star. In the end i just gave up on finishing this garbage. "
"1008",1007,"Bill Pruitt","I bought this book because of all the buzz around it but I could not be more disappointed. Very slow and sluggish. Unlikeable characters that make it difficult to become invested. A mystery with no mystery, a thriller with no thrills, a psychological with no psychology just overly dramatic scenes and weak characters. Can't see what has caused the outpouring of praise. "
"1010",1009,"Fabienne","no,no, NO! it's not thrilling at all. it's not grabbing me. i don't like it. i actually hate it. i can't...just...NO! i really wanted to like it. i actualy haven't finishied it."
"1011",1010,"Tina Rousseau","This was more about the train and less about the girl. Very boring couldn't finish"
"1012",1011,"Andrea Joy","I really do not understand what all the hype is about this book. I found all of the female characters to be incredibly weak and two-dimensional. They all share the same common goal in life: find a man and make babies. Gag me. I also guessed the ending about a third of the way through the book. "
"1013",1012,"Laurie","Meh. I really didn't like this book. Especially the parts narrated by Megan. Particularly at the end where she's apparently writing journal entries on the way to (spoiler). People keep comparing this to Gone Girl. Gone Girl is a much better book. Dark, but better. "
"1014",1013,"Lottie","I was really excited to start reading this book as I had heard good things about it, and it was the number one bestseller on Amazon. I was  seriously  disappointed. I found it boring from the start to the finish, and I found all the characters uninteresting. This book had the potentially to be the next best thriller, but it fell flat. "
"1016",1015,"JJMPLSMN","I thought this was one of the most over-rated books I have ever read. Everyone said, ""you have to read this"". I did. It was depressing, the story was trite, the ""heroine"" was a mess, and the guilty party was telegraphed long before he was announced. Really, a waste of my precious reading time. Get another book. There are MILLIONS of books better than this one."
"1017",1016,"Elise Hamilton","It took me quite a while to finish The Girl on the Train (GOTT). There are three reasons. I've had several weeks of guests, thus not much reading time. When I did read, it was before bed and I was tired, so read fewer pages than I usually do. Last, it simply didn't hold my interest very well. It might have been these short bursts of reading that made me like it so little, but whatever it was, I thought it was only marginally OK. Others had likened it to Gone Girl, but I think it was miles away from GG. The writing seem lacking, and the story moved so slowly that I was bored. I persevered only because a trusted reading buddy had liked it. The ending was very predictable, and I kept wanting the narrators to hurry up and confirm what I'd guessed from about chapter two. "
"1020",1019,"Emma Flaherty","Let me just start by saying I really wanted to like this book. I almost never buy books anymore, let alone a hardcover, so I was very disappointed that I wasted my money. I love despicable, impossible-to-like characters. Gone Girl and The Great Gatsby are two of my favorite novels and arguably every character in those books are unpleasant in their own ways. The key with difficult characters is that there has to be some reason I care about them anyway -- whether I love to hate them or I cheer them on despite how terrible they are -- but I never found myself caring about any of the characters in this book. The ending wasn't particularly surprising either. I hate a mystery where the end isn't unexpected and I had figured this one out about halfway through. If you don't mind fluffy stories, you may like this one. A lot of people did, and there's nothing wrong with that. I just feel that the comparison to Gone Girl is ill founded. Sad I wasted my time. "
"1021",1020,"Autumn Johnson","Ok how ANNOYING is the Rachel girl? I had to read this book quickly so I wouldn't throw it out of a window I disliked her character so much. This book gets one star from me becauseIt is not even comparable to Gone Girl as everyone is saying. The 'twist' at the end was so expected. We all knew Tom killed Megan from the get go... AND you're supposed to feel bad for Rachel at the end? Boo hoo, no thanks. I need to read more non-fiction after reading this. "
"1022",1021,"Nichole","Are you kidding me. Seriously, you have to be kidding me. I just need to take every character, literally every character, except Evie because she is A BABY, put them in a blender and just be rid of them. I guess it was an ok story, with an ok plot, but honestly, I just finished it to see if they all died in a horrible accident or not. Spoiler: They did not. "
"1023",1022,"Heather Finley","Felt this was predictable the entire way through. Disliked all the characters. Sometimes that's not a bad thing. I love dislikable character written by Gillian Flynn and Joe Hill. These ones though? Not so much. "
"1024",1023,"TheBookCat (Rita)","Every single character was beyond annoying, whiny and just plain stupid. I listened to this on audio thinking that it would make the experience a little better. If anything it made me dislike the characters even more. I normally like a good thriller. This one however didn't thrill me all that much. Like most people who disliked this book, I too thought this was a hot mess."
"1025",1024,"Barkha Patel","annoying characters and predictable plot. not sure what the commotion is about. I'll stick with the classics."
"1026",1025,"Deb Zeman","Did not care for characters. Plot was cliche. There are no heroes in this book and I really found no purpose for reading it. "
"1027",1026,"Cody Doll","This was a pretty easy read and kept me on my toes. The only thing I didn't like was the switching between dates, I felt this made it hard to keep up with the story line. Other that then that I liked the story line and characters. I also I liked the ending."
"1028",1027,"Lívia Kostiuk","Muito decepcionante, uma estrela é muito! Personagens mal trabalhados, uma trama que tinha tudo pra ser super thriller trocada por um mistério forçado e previsível. Fazia tempo que não me arrependia de ler algo até o final, mas esse livro ganhou! Qualquer um da Agatha Christie dá um samba, e fácil! "
"1029",1028,"Patty Grossert","All the main characters are unlikeable. I didn't care who came out on top in the end. And I figured out the culprit well before the end. I would not read another book by this author."
"1030",1029,"Moira","Exhausting!"
"1032",1031,"Gerhard","What a crock of horse shit. It is as if Paula Hawkins set about rewriting Fatal Attraction, with the Glenn Close role played by at least three male characters, with not a single redeeming feature among them. For me, that is the most insulting inference from this lurid, over-the-top and completely unbelievable potboiler: that all men are unfaithful by nature, and will ultimately succumb to their baser natures if given half a chance.And as if that is not enough of a stereotype, let us not forget the devious therapist that Hawkins throws in for good measure. Ah ha, but she adds a twist: he is of Serbian extraction, and therefore his ‘golden honey’ skin hints of darker motives and deeds … A male writer would quickly be taken to task for such rampant sexism. And being of the fairer sex certainly does not vindicate Hawkins. She is simply being boorish.I thought that I would join the Goodreads juggernaut and read an ‘It’ novel for a change, which is why I gave this a try. I have not read Gone Girl to date, so have no comparative basis on which to judge The Girl on the Train, except to say (and, perhaps, fervently to hope) that Gillian Flynn’s novel cannot be any worse than this malarkey.There is absolutely no psychological nuance here. In the Big Reveal at the end, the Bad Guy actually winks at his duped, innocent victim, who as per Hollywood trope is, of course, a tearful wreck of a woman who Did Not See It Coming.Still, one cannot deny that this novel has been a huge success, perhaps in the wake of Gone Girl. Does this point to a sub-genre where women want to read about Relationships Gone Wrong?, and about Men Who Are Not Who They Seem To Be? While Hawkins seems to invoke Miltonic wrath against her male characters for screwing around, she offers no comment on the women here, with their picture postcard-perfect lives, who nevertheless have a gratuitous itch to scratch. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that Hawkins implies that the baser nature of men actually compels women into committing infidelity. How fucked up is that in this age of the hijab and smart bombs?There is such a strong whiff of Puritanism and conservative knee-jerking here that I almost expected my Kindle to burst into flames at my insidious thought that why didn’t the female protagonists just say, fuck the men, and fuck themselves?The strongest element of The Girl on the Train is definitely its depiction of the destructive impact of alcoholism on an individual and a relationship. This part of the book rings true with such clarity and sadness that it is quite heart-breaking to read.So much more the pity then that while the reader has great sympathy for Rachel, the Fatal Attraction contortions of the asinine plot are so exasperating that such empathy is quickly diluted. This is a real steaming turd of a novel, a half-baked excretion of clichés, prejudices and stereotypes. Yes, there is a dull core of steel to some of the writing. You just have to scrape the shit off first."
"1033",1032,"Jane Rudebusch","Had to struggle through 300 pages of uninteresting, unsympathetic characters - from the alcoholic narrator to the jealous ""other woman"" trope - to get to the ""twist"" at the end. Worth it? No. This is NOT Gone Girl, not even close. Supremely disappointed that all the hype this book got made me push through hoping to get to the good part. "
"1034",1033,"J. Kirsch","If a plot twist is all that needs to make a great book, then this would be a great book. Unfortunately it requires a bit more than that. The main problem with this book is that it's almost impossible to have even a shred of respect for any of the characters. Another reader called the alcoholic blackouts in the narrative ""fascinating."" That's fascinating I guess in the same way that watching someone puke is fascinating. Horrible/horrific and fascinating are seldom equivalent, at least not for most of us. Maybe this is why I prefer mystery or mystery/thriller to straight thrillers. A good mystery develops the puzzle AND the characters and makes you care about at least one of them. If you want to read a good mystery thriller I suggest Elsa Hart's Jade Dragon Mountain. Or pretty much anything other than this book."
"1035",1034,"Sabibooboo","I hate giving books bad reviews, but reading this was like slowly impaling myself on a very dull sword. It was slow, tedious, and by the time it finally got a little more exciting I had already figured out what was going to happen.I knew going into this book I wasn't going to love it, but the plot sounded interesting enough, so I gave it a fair chance by reading every mind numbing page. A large chunk of this book is essentially the ramblings of a borderline-stalker, alcoholic. It's exactly what you'd expect, depressing, and certainly not ""thrilling."" I hated every single character, except for a side character named Cathy because she was the only person who gave a flying fish about anyone other than herself. However the reason I disliked the characters so much is not only because they were crappy people, it's because they all lacked good development. For the most part they each whine about one thing the entire book, Rachel about Tom, Anna about Rachel, and Megan about being restless. Their complaints are basically the extent of their ""personalities.""I really can't go on much more about this book. The characters were awful and lacked depth, the pace was slow and much of the book completely unrelated to any mystery. I will say things picked up a bit towards the end, but not enough to save this trainwreck of a novel. In my opinion, it is not worth the time it takes to read it."
"1037",1036,"Tamara","Started out with such promise, I was engrossed for the first 20 pages.Thereafter, I felt that the writing became poor and the story did not become any more suspenseful. A solid first novel, but not one that I really enjoyed."
"1038",1037,"Julie Abramaitys","Honestly was so excited about finally getting to read this and am so disappointed.what was all the hype and fuss about?such a boring read:("
"1039",1038,"Ray","An absolute alcoholic pity party. This book would have been a fantastic mystery novel were it not for the insufferable, self pitying main character. She is an alcoholic. She wants to get her life together. She goes on a bender and gets miserable. This is the main plot of the majority of the book, not the strange disappearance of a young woman. The cyclic thoughts and actions of the alcoholic main became so constant and annoying that, by the time the twist ending rolled around, I was just... done with this book. Perhaps its popularity is like that of a reality show. People just want to watch a train wreck."
"1040",1039,"Alex Coulsell","This book was utterly horrible! I was looking forward to reading it, it had been so hyped up and had great reviews, I had high expectations but I was VERY disappointed.It was so slow, we kept going around in circles with Rachael. She got drunk, did something stupid, couldn't remember, and it went on and on the same way for the whole book. I kept waiting for her to do something different, something interesting but it was just horrible character development. I hated all the characters, they were boring and pathetic, it was the same with them, we just went around in circles.The layout of the story was so bad, it's almost like the author wanted to fill in time until the end, so she just wrote the same thing over and over. It wasn't really a story, it was just back and forth.I kept reading hoping for something good to happen, but it never did, even the climax when we find out about The killer was boring, I wasn't shocked or surprised. Then end fell flat.This is probably the worst book I've ever read and I wish I hadn't. I honesty can't comprehend how it got such good reviews, it is rubbish."
"1041",1040,"Harold Carlson","I read this book a couple months ago. People that I have spoken to really enjoyed this book but I did not. From my perspective there are way too many messed up people in this story. Of course that is exactly why the folks that told me they liked it thought it was such a good book!"
"1042",1041,"Rose","I know this book is wildly popular, & I read it for book club, but that didn't make me like it any better. It was torture reading the first 1/2, thinking of the stack of good books I could be reading, then I told myself it is a quick read, just get 'er done! I admit I am not into fiction, especially about an alcoholic who makes incredibly insane decisions on a daily basis, surrounded by idiots. Really?! Not my idea of an enjoyable read."
"1043",1042,"Rosa","It was impossible to give it less than one star or else I would have. What is the hype about this uncomprehensible rant? I don't understand. I read 25-30 pages and it was the biggest waste of my time. There went some time out of my life I'll never get back. Terrible."

"1061",1060,"Rebekah","1. This story was not about a girl. It was about a woman. Difference.2. The storyline fit in nicely; the plot was good. None of the characters were good, though; there was no one to root for. Abusive husbands; alcoholics; unrealistic unemployment. I think the author was trying to put down red herrings everywhere. All she did was make me sad there wasn't a higher body count. 3. I wouldn't read this unless you are very, very bored and you are, like me, attempting to avoid writing a twenty-page paper on Medieval drama. "

Hated ""Unbroken"", ""Eat,Pray and Love"" and thought ""Gone Girl"" was terrible as I do not like books with no characters to like. So I can honestly say, in my opinion of course, that ""Girl"" was a terrible read. The 1st 3 chapters were absolutely boring, but I persevered, as I thought, it can't continue to be this bad. Well it was. 3 whiny, horrible woman as the main characters. An alcoholic and 2 cheaters. Really. Why should a care about them? I didn't. I figured out the murderer pretty early on, and he was also a waste of a character. There are so many great books out there. What is the Zeitgeist that a badly written, boring book like this (and I will throw 50 Shades in as another incredibly badly written book) get all this attention, while beautifully realized, well written books get overlooked? Please do not waste your time!!!"
"1065",1064,"Rosie Carlo","I honestly wanted to like this book but it never happened. When I read a book I can usually connect with wome of the characters. But with this one, I actually hated every character. They were all unhappy and depressed and made me feel that way as well. "
"1066",1065,"Rixceny","This is one of the most boring books I've ever read. It was very difficult to trudge through. I seriously do not see what the hype is all about. Very depressing, slow, and dark. I loved Gone Girl, which has been compared to this book regularly. I truly felt like this was a waste of my time. "

"1069",1068,"Raeesa","This book started out alright, but I figured I'd wait for it to get better. Partway through I began to regret the braincells I was killing reading it. None of the characters had any redeeming qualities. Rachel's uselessness astounds me: can someone really pretend to have a job for that long?? And while I definitely cannot relate to the difficulty of an alcoholic to stop drinking, her drinking really just drove me crazy as well as her inability to mind her own business. Megan is annoying, Anna is messed up (she enjoys being a mistress, umm...). Everyone seems to live in their own little bubble without any awareness of the real world and especially no sense of right and wrong.The only positive thing I can say about this book is that it was well written. The author really took advantage of the unreliable narrators technique so that the ending was something you never saw coming, but is believable once you get to the end."
"1070",1069,"Kaley","I found this to be really predictable and not worth the hype. At ALL. Rachel is desperately lonely. Her life and marriage has fallen apart, and she has turned to both alcohol and a couple she observes from her morning commute for comfort. She creates a perfect life for them, almost giving hope for herself while she simultaneously watches her ex-husband rebuild his family just a few houses away from her fictional dream couple. After Megan, ""Jess"" as Rachel calls her, disappears, Rachel inserts herself into the investigation and lives of those closest to her.I really hated everyone in this book. Every one. This was Gone Girl all over again, but worse. Right down to the structure of it switching characters' POV. I have no idea how this is topping the Best Sellers list, guys. "
"1071",1070,"Patsy Gray","A real dragThe tedium of most of this book was never justified by a skillful climax. Three largely interchangeable male-identified women obsessing about two loser men is beyond tiresome. It's decades out of date; even the three pops sound the same. Bad,bad,book"
"1072",1071,"Meghan","Too dark"
"1073",1072,"Sunny","Probably one of the most boring books I've read... if I had the option to unread it - I'd take it. I could not relate to or even get myself to care about the protagonist at all. The plot dragged for long periods and some of the decisions made by some of the characters were hard to believe at best. It was difficult to find any sympathy or empathy for any of the characters in the book. Most were loathsome. For much of the book I had to force myself to continue because after a while, I found myself no longer caring about what happened to anyone. I dunno... just too contrived for me."
"1074",1073,"Martina Zerbinati","La logica degli editori è, solitamente, quella del profitto: un libro viene pubblicato se può diventare in fretta un bestseller, indipendentemente dalla sua qualità letteraria. La ragazza del treno di Paula Hawkins ha, in effetti, del potenziale ma, forse, prima di pubblicarlo, sarebbe stato necessario pagare un vero scrittore affinché lo riscrivesse da capo a piedi. Il libro riporta la voce narrante di tre donne diverse, tutte vagamente psicopatiche - il genere femminile in questo romanzo non fa una gran bella figura: Rachel, la ""vera"" protagonista, la ragazza del treno, è un'ubriacona che ha iniziato a perdere il controllo con l'alcol perchè non riusciva a rimanere incinta; un problema, quello con l'alcolismo, che ha quasi costretto il marito, Tom, a cercarsi un'altra donna, Anna, la seconda voce narrante del romanzo, che lo sposa e in pochi mesi - quanto basta per portare a termine una gravidanza - dà alla luce la piccola Evie; la terza donna, Megan, è una bellissima biondona che Rachel spia tutte le mattine dal finestrino del treno, immaginandosi per lei una vita meravigliosa, quella che la nostra ubriacona non ha mai avuto. Megan un giorno sparirà e, dopo poco tempo, verrà ritrovata, ormai cadavere, non molto distante dai binari di quel treno che Rachel prende tutti i giorni. Rachel diventerà ossessionata da questo omicidio: se la fata madrina aveva trasformato Cenerentola in una bellissima principessa, la fata madrina di Rachel la trasformerà in un battibaleno in Gil Grissom, con un fiuto per le indagini migliore di quello di qualunque cane da tartufo. Sì, se ve lo state domandando sarà Rachel - mica la polizia - a risolvere il caso. La magia della fata madrina, d'altra parte, è infallibile. Io non so quanto abbiano pagato Stephen King per fargli scrivere la recensione che trovate sul retro di copertina del romanzo: sta di fatto che di suspense in questo romanzo ce n'è davvero poca: si intuisce chi è l'assassino all'incirca a metà del romanzo, non appena si legge che Megan era incinta di un uomo che non era nè suo marito nè il suo storico amante. E così si legge la seconda metà del romanzo pensando: Madonna, quanto la mena, sappiamo tutti come va a finire. La scena finale - saltate queste righe se non volete rovinarvi la lettura - è poi degna di un film di Quentin Tarantino: un bel cavatappi conficcato nel collo dell'assassino di Megan, un bel cavatappi conficcato nel collo e rigirato sempre più a fondo: la polizia crederà poi che quel cavatappi così in fondo al collo ci è finito per difesa, cioè non è mica stato volontario. In effetti è un po' profondo però dai, può capitare. Il peggio però non è dato dalla storia. Il romanzo è ridicolo per come è scritto. L'incapacità dell'autrice la si nota soprattutto nella descrizione delle dinamiche degli incidenti: una confusione sbalorditiva, spero che l'autrice non abbia la patente perchè la sua conoscenza del codice della strada è paurosa. Riporto un esempio da pagina 53, parla Megan: ""un tizio in moto continuava a sgasare e una macchina rossa procedeva lentamente come se al volante ci fosse uno che va a prostitute; due donne con il passeggino bloccavano il passaggio, non potevo superarle rimanendo sul marciapiedi, così sono scesa in strada e per poco non sono stata investita da un'auto che arrivava nella direzione opposta"". Eh? Cioè l'auto che ha rischiato di investirla le arrivava di fronte (come ha fatto a non vederla allora, doveva arrivarle da dietro per essere verosimile la scena) e per superare le donne col passeggino Megan si è fiondata in mezzo alla strada? Il tizio in moto e la macchina rossa erano sull'altra corsia? Non ho capito. Ancora, Paula Hawkins mette in mezzo patologie di cui non ha la minima conoscenza. Prima della descrizione dell'incidente che ho riportato, Megan afferma di avere avuto un attacco di panico in seguito allo scampato incidente. Il cuore le batte a mille, le viene la nausea, però finisce le sue commissioni, torna a casa, si siede e aspetta che torni il marito, cercando di calmarsi. Ma non è un attacco di panico questo, è una comprensibile ansia dovuta al fatto di essere quasi stata tirata sotto da un'auto. Se Megan avesse avuto un attacco di panico sarebbe andata in iperventilazione, non avrebbe capito più niente, probabilmente non sarebbe riuscita a tornare a casa subito con una tale logica. Prima di scrivere determinate cose, apriamo anche solo una pagina di Wikipedia - in inglese poi sono fatte anche piuttosto bene Paula Hawkins poi cerca di creare fin dall'inizio un'atmosfera da thriller: un giorno, dal treno, Rachel vede ammucchiati, vicino ai binari, dei vestiti: subito si lancia in supposizioni melodrammatiche, la notte addirittura non riesce a dormire perchè lì potrebbe essere morto qualcuno, potrebbe essere stato compiuto un omicidio, infatti riflette sul fatto che, quelle delle persone che muoiono sotto un treno, ""non sono tutte morti accidentali"" (pagina 16). Infatti si chiamano suicidi, Rachel. Se fossi in Italia e prendessi la linea di Trenitalia lo sapresti. Ci sono poi le riflessioni da femminista da quattro soldi. Megan è malata di sesso: vuole sempre piacere agli uomini, vuole avere il potere di concedersi, far perdere la testa all'uomo di turno e poi mollarlo al suo destino. Tenta di giustificare il suo comportamento con una riflessione davvero stereotipata: ""non capisco perchè dovrei limitarmi se nessuno lo fa. Gli uomini non lo fanno"" (pagina 55). Santo cielo, il personaggio di Megan è quello del tro**ne da combattimento, non facciamole fare riflessioni inutili. Ma soprattutto, lasciamola così: non trasformiamola poi, nella seconda parte, nella donna triste e fragile che non è riuscita a imporsi nella vita e i cui difetti sono dovuti alla durezza delle sue esperienze. Il personaggio peggiore però è Anna: viene descritta come la leonessa che protegge il suo cucciolo ma, alla fine, si comporta nel modo più inverosimile possibile - spoiler in seguito, se preferite passate al prossimo paragrafo: alla fine, alla resa dei conti, quando Rachel rischierà di essere a sua volta uccisa dall'assassino di Megan, Anna farà all'inizio finta di niente, anzi si augurerà che Rachel muoia per ricominciare una vita felice. Una mamma così protettiva lascerebbe che suo marito, Tom, perchè è lui l'assassino, cresca sua figlia? Ma quando mai? L'istinto materno svanisce così di colpo? Per poi tornare di nuovo di colpo, convincendola ad affondare il cavatappi nel collo di suo marito? Boh. Psicopatica forte. Ma il difetto peggiore consiste nell'architettura stessa del romanzo. Le tre donne protagoniste parlano tutte in prima persona ma, dietro alle loro parole, si avverte sempre la presenza del narratore onnisciente che non riesce proprio a mettersi da parte: dietro ogni donna si intravede Paula Hawkins. Tutte e tre infatti sono troppo simili: hanno problemi a dormire, condividono le stesse riflessioni, spesso gli stessi traumi. Se all'inizio di ogni capitolo non ci fosse scritto il nome della voce narrante non avrei saputo dire chi diventava, in quel momento, la protagonista. Un enorme limite per uno scrittore. La ragazza del treno è, in fondo, un thriller da quattro soldi e, in quanto tale, non dovrebbe costare di più. "

I felt that I had sunk too much time into it already to not finish, but I really didn't want to continue.  I completely understand that characters without flaws are boring, but characters with nothing BUT flaws are grating and awful. That's what this book has to offer. Every single main character is a horrible, self-centered, vindictive, and violent. I didn't care about any of them and, although I would NEVER say that anyone deserves to be murdered, I felt that they were all ruining their own lives, and none of them deserved much better."

"1095",1094,"Hannah","*Slight Spoilers*To be honest, I couldn't even finish this book. For all the hype, it was complete and utter drivel. We start off with a slovenly drunk feeling sorry for herself. I don't have a problem with people down on their fortune-- I have only respect for people who try to make the best of a poor situation-- but Rachel whined more than a two-year-old that's missed naptime. 'Oh, my husband left me...I can't break my drinking problem...I really want to be nice to the friend that's given me a place to stay, but I just can't because I'm too busy wallowing in grief...' If I had a physical copy of this book, I would have thrown it against the wall. Still, I slogged through pages hoping for some redeeming factor, only to be greeted with--surprise!-- yet another female with issues, defined more by her past and current relationships than any quality of her own. If I wanted to listen to this much whining and irredeemable self-pity, I would have babysat today. I could go on about how forced the plot seemed (the entire thing revolves around a drunkard concerned for a stranger she's spotted a few times from the train window; better yet, the alcohol makes her forget and remember things seemingly at random-- how convenient!) or how the point of view was lacking, but I don't have the time nor desire to write an essay at the moment. Suffice it to say, enough people have been comparing this to Gone Girl that I'll avoid reading /that/ like kryptonite. "

It's often compared to Gone Girl, but has nothing like Flynn's depth of characters, suspense and let's face it, psychosis. I forced myself to finish it, hoping for a redeeming ending, which I did not find. The writing is sub par, the characters have no depth. The plot is BO-RING. Rachel's ""blackout"" (in which something ""very bad"" happened) is not just convenient, but also annoying. I don't know. I just don't get it folks. This one was not for me."
"1113",1112,"Brea Dunn","This book shares a similar structure to Gone Girl. Chapters bounce from character's different perspectives. Gone Girl is a much better story! The characters in ""...Train"" are cliche and churlish. The main narrater is alcoholic and a mess, it even dampened my mood.I felt myself racing through chapters in order to finish the book. It was tedious, not thrilling to piece together the story. I'm surprised to see how popular the book's become. The ending finale is outrageous; points for an entertainment factor!"

"1115",1114,"Alan Kaplan","I bought and read this book because it was number 1 on all of the NY Times best seller lists. I figured that the American public could not be wrong. Well I was wrong. The public is wrong. This is this year's attempt to equal the success of Gone Girl.The author has attempted to write a murder mystery with a twist. Like Gone Girl, she has attempted to give the main character a major flaw. The main character in The Girl on the Train is a raging alcoholic. In Gone Girl, the main character is an adulterous womanizer. You can pretty much guess the plot from that. We are led to believe one thing, and then presto chango, something changes. Gone Girl, I believe, pulled this off brilliantly. The Girl on the Train cannot quite pull this off. When I discussed the book with my wife, we could not quite remember what happened at the end. That is my definition of a mediocre book. I can remember the plot of Gone Girl easily and quickly. I cannot imagine how this book became so popular."

"1120",1119,"Hal","The book starts with an interesting premise, but boy are the characters flat and heinous! None of the main characters has even a shred of reason to them, they're helplessly being swept about by their emotions. They're without the slightest planning or anticipation, clueless and unable to think one straight thought, and also completely oblivious to how their erratic behaviour hurts the people around them.Revolving around love, relationships, infidelities and crimes of passion, the story reads like pulp. I picked it up because it was a summer hit and someone likened it to Gone Girl, but it's alas far less believable, complex, or well-written. It's several leagues below. Definitely not recommended! The only reason I powered through to the end is because I needed to rack up my read count for my Goodreads reading challenge, and also it was a bit like the fascination of watching a train wreck, no pun intended."

I get it that she was pathetic for a reason, and that we are all but a step away from that, no worries about that. What I couldn't stand was her relentless unwillingness to move forward. Also, the plot twist was not very surprising to me. I am usually terrible at figuring out the twist; I'm always the last to know. However, about halfway though I had a guess that turned out to be correct.This book just left me flat on all fronts. It felt to me like a weak, poorly-put-together copy of gone girl."

And then I read the book and became one of those people.The mystery of the book was fine. But it was so hard to get past the people! So unlikeable!

"1147",1146,"Marion","I had high hopes for this book as the premise of a girl on a train witnessing a crime from her window seat sounded like the start of a great read.This book was a page turner for me only because I was curious to see how this mess of underdeveloped and dysfunctional cast of characters would eventually play out. I really didn't care about any of the characters and especially not Rachael. The author created one dimensional characters who played the old time roles of women who cannot live or are nothing with out a man and men who are brutes and just think with their penises.I felt bad for the Rachael character, but the constant apologies for her real/imagined misbehavior became tiresome. The author could have utilized the roommate character Cathy much more effectively, perhaps showing a little girl power, rather that just someone Rachael hid from until Cathy herself would reunite with her man who appeared to be another judgmental male.The ending was one I have watched many times in low budget thriller movies. Even when all was done, the remaining women did not connect to console and recover from their ordeal. I wasn't looking for a ""lets be best friends"" ending, but some acknowledgement of surviving something together would have given this superficial story some much needed depth."

"1149",1148,"Seerin","Partiamo da un semplice presupposto: a me, sto libro, non è piaciuto. E perciò inizio a dubitare della mia capacità di giudizio. All'inizio del romanzo infatti c'è tutta la storia dell'""incredibile successo"", del ""potere del passaparola"", ""sedicenti milioni di copie vendute in una notte!!!111!!!"" che rappresentano il background del libro. Seriously? This book?! DAFUQ Sono seriamente allibita. Soprattutto da quando ho scoperto che su Goodreads a una valutazione di quasi 4 stelle. Di nuovo: SERIOUSLY?!Per me ci sono un sacco di cose sbagliate in questo libro:- la narrazione; dovrebbe essere un thriller, giusto? Dovrebbe creare suspance, giusto? Ma non lo fa: nemmeno alla fine. Niente. Succede qualcosa? La protagonista è troppo ubriaca per ricordarsene quindi, nada. la protagonista e in generale, le figure femminili; da donna, mi sento OFFESA. - il setting: l'idea del treno è quello che mi ha fatto avvicinare al libro. Una presa in giro per il lettore. Le descrizioni sono pure penose, se consideriamo ""descrizioni"" quelle quattro parole messe in fila che ci fanno capire solo dove siamo, perchè, non sia mai, dare qualche particolare in più... No no, assolutamente. - l'indagine e la polizia in generale: ridicola oltre ogni dire. i sedicenti misteri, i colpi di scena e i *inforca gli occhiali e legge dalla trama ufficiale* ribaltamenti di trama sono la cosa più FUFFA della storia. - Un casino di pseudoeventi scollegati tra di loro che dovrebbero dare una personalità e una storia ai singoli personaggi, ma che si rivelano assolutamente inutili. Un guazzabuglio di viaggi in treno tutti uguali, di bevute, lamentele, interrogatori alla polizia, chiacchiere... che gettano solo tanto, ma davvero tanto fumo negli occhi del lettore. Ricopio l'ultimo rigo della trama di Goodreads: Ma che cos’ha visto davvero Rachel?"" Risposta non spoiler: ASSOLUTAMENTE UNA SCIOCCHEZZA.Una sciocchezza che mette in moto comunque una serie di eventi assurdi e inutili, perché raccontati per la maggior parte del tempo da una donna sempre ubriaca che non ricorda una mazza di quello che fa/vede/dice.E iniziano così una serie di capitoli che, a rotazione, ci offrono i punti di vista di tre donne diverse ma ugualmente frustrate, alle prese con un mistero che, nonostante la sua portata, non è assolutamente thrilling o, a dircela tutta, effettivamente misterioso: basta aver visto una puntata di un qualsiasi telefilm crime in circolazione per capire come sono andate le cose.Ad aggravare la assoluta banalità della situazione, c'è il suddetto un trittico di personaggi femminili da prendere solo a badilate sui denti: la protagonista Rachel non fa nient'altro che bere, lamentarsi, piangere per il suo ex marito e riprendere a bere, per poi lamentarsi di nuovo, e via in una spirale di inutilità che si trascina per capitoli e capitoli e capitoli...L'alcolismo non è certo un argomento da prendere sottogamba: è un problema serio, che effettivamente annebbia la mente e la volontà di chi ne è affetto.Purtroppo, ai fini di un thriller psicologico, rendere squilibrato il personaggio principale, è deleterio ai fini della storia.Non aggiunge il fattore ""oddio adesso i ricordi si risvegliano e il colpo di scena ci lascia sconvolti!"" ma è solamente e dannatamente frustrante, perché se la protagonista inutile non ricorda nulla da cosa dovremmo essere tenuti in ansia? Dal fatto che poi andrà a comprare un'altra cavolo di bottiglia di vino e che quindi ripartirà da capo lamentandosi che non ricorda niente??Come se non bastasse, le continue e imperterrite lamentele di Rachel non la rendono certo simpatica: petulante e incredibilmente cieca circa tutto quello che la circonda, da un giorno all'altro si impunta perché il suo sogno ad occhi aperti fatto dal finestrino del treno va in frantumi.MA CHE DAFAQ?!E' caratterizzata con l'accetta e pure padrona di un pensiero così degradante per la donna, cioè...""Il mio lavoro mi piaceva, ma non avevo una carriera brillante; anche se l'avessi avuta, sappiamo bene che le donne sono valutate soltanto in base a due parametri: il loro aspetto fisico e il loro essere madri. Io non sono e bella e non posso avere figli. Quindi sono un essere del tutto inutile."" AH BELLA! MA PARLA UN PO' PER TE, PER CORTESIA. Quindi dovrei simpatizzare per una che ritiene le donne non belle e non madri INUTILI? Un pensiero del genere, nel 2015, non lo accetto, mi dispiace.Anna, la seconda donna protagonista, invece vive praticamente in funzione della sua bambina, non si muove se non per la bambina, o per la famiglia, e il giardino, e la casa...Acida e antipatica, tanto che nemmeno le sue eventuali attenuanti (cioè lo stress di essere, secondo lei, vittima di persecuzione) reggono. Verso la conclusione della storia, poi, dice e fa cose che la rendono solo un'oca bionda decerebrata.La terza figura femminile invece ci regala un background tragico che ai fini della storia è assolutamente inutile, superficiale e che mira solamente a farci dire ""Oh, povera ragazza. Che passato tragico!"". Quando poi l'attenzione e la sensibilità del lettore doveva essere concentrata su ben più attuali problemi come la violenza domestica.Quindi, tirando le somme, dal punto di vista dei personaggi il romanzo è un FAIL completo.E come potrebbe mai anche essere definito un thriller psicologico, allora? Sarebbe, ihmo, un'offesa a tutti i veri romanzi di questo genere.Si arriva alla fine solo per avere nel giro di 15 pagine la rivelazione finale. Ovvia, presentata su un piatto d'argento, senza che effettivamente si possa fare un ragionamento su di esso, dato che tutto ciò che ha preceduto la risoluzione del mistero ha fatto appiattire l'elettroencefalogramma del lettore.Ciò che mi preoccupa, dopo la lettura di questo romanzo, è che la tv lo pubblicizza e che la gente lo comprerà.Ragazzi, veramente, evitate. Il mondo è vasto e la frutta è tanto varia. Assaggiate altro. "

"1151",1150,"Regan (Literary Luminary) Bennett","dnf at 26 pages This book is utterly boring.I don't care about anyone at all. I don't care about what happened to whatever. Paula Hawkins was a journalist before and is now trying her hand at fiction for the first time and is failing miserably. I hope she takes some courses or workshops on creative writing for fiction because I'm reading this book like a newspaper and her writing is similar to that of article voice. There's no natural storyteller in Paula Hawkins. "
"1152",1151,"Marit Rødevand","Horrible book. Picked it up just before going on a 10 hour flight and was stuck with it. Poor language, uninteresting plot and boring characters. Only reason for finishing it was because I was stuck on a plane and had nothing else to do."
"1153",1152,"Adrienne","Although this book received good reviews (NPR, Guardian), I found it convoluted and quite depressing. "
"1154",1153,"Jake Davis","I found this book to be pretty awful. I struggled to read it and at no point felt compelled to put off doing anything else in order to do so. Slow, lot of exposition, uninteresting characters, and a shockingly bad ending. "
"1155",1154,"Lady Godiva","If you liked Gone Girl, doesn't mean you gonna like or even enjoy this book. The similarity between these two books is superficial. This one is (sort of) a triller, there's a wife that goes missing, and the title has the word ""girl"" in it. One positive thing that I have to say about The Girl on the Train is that it's fast-paced. But on the other hand, character development suffers from it, in my opinion. While the characters of Gone Girl, whilts being psychotic assholes, also had motives that you sort of understood, the characters (every characters, every singe one of them) are just assholes. And that's it. Assholes. Jerks. Bitches. They just.. do things. Abusive, awful things, whithout even thinking about them, without considering consequences. Granted, people act the same way in real life too, but not everyone! Not in every situation! And there are just too many coincidences! This book left such a blanc impression on me, that I barely have will to rant about how ""meh"" it was. I didn't feel any compassion towards the main character. And another, last thing, that just irritates me: when your main character is refered to as a 'girl' by the title, it better be a girl, someone not older than twenty-something. (Yeah-yeah, Amy Dunn was also far from a twenty-something, but she at least was beautiful, fit, youthful, .... The 'girl' here is a thirty-something divorcee with a sreious drinking problem, who has already gave up on being presentable, and her own friend notes that there is no man that't be desperate enough to get with her.)"

"1157",1156,"Emily Moore","I tried to get into this book yet the depressing, self-pitying tone of the first 50 pages or so really turned me off. For being a psychological thriller, this one missed the mark early on. Maybe one day I will come back to it... for now, there are too many othet books awaiting me."
"1158",1157,"Jennifer Soosar","Trainwreck. I like dark psychological thrillers and looked forward to reading this, but this was too dreary and had zero humor. The alcoholic protagonist had no character development, neither did the other characters who were equally dull. With a small handful of settings and nothing going on in the plot, it felt claustrophobic to read. Tedious descriptions of the main character's drinking problem. Found myself skimming through the second half just to get to the end, hoping it would turn around. It did not."

"1160",1159,"Judy Neger","I feel like books that claim to be similar to ""gone girl"" are a hit or miss. I'm not sure why so many people loved this book. It took me forever to get through it. It was cliché and boring. The characters were beyond annoying, I couldn't stand the Rachel character and the ending was lame."
"1163",1162,"Peggy","I didn't enjoy this book, I didn't even read the whole book, I didn't want to keep reading about a woman who was a drunk and a woman who was sex crazed, I know people say this is a great book. I don't even know what I am going to do with the book, there isn't anybody I want to give it too. "

I made it thorough 40% and I’m sure this is more this book deserves. I just don’t get why this book is so popular. This is a lesson for me. If the book appears on book store windows as ‘best sellers’ I should not grab it. Good book doesn’t need advertisement. "

It took me so long to read it because it wasn't interesting enough for me to want to read all the time."
"1173",1172,"Arlene","The main character made way too many stupid decisions for my taste, exasperatingly so. The plot hung on actions that she took that I could not believe a real human being, no matter how psychologically damaged, would take.I found the resolution to the mystery predictable and the characters unlikable. "
"1174",1173,"Marijke Van Wassenhove","Waw, wat kostte het me veel moeite om in dit boek te geraken. Pas in het laatste deel kon ik een beetje meeleven met de hoofdpersonage. Het verhaal op zich viel best mee, maar ik had blijkbaar een probleem met de schrijfstijl...denk niet dat ik snel nog een boek van deze schrijfster zal lezen. Eerlijk gezegd snap ik de hype niet rond dit boek. Er bestaan er idd slechtere maar massa's betere, in mijn ogen geen bestseller, sorry."
"1175",1174,"Annie","Couldn't finish. "
"1176",1175,"Jenny Lindsey","The characters in “The Girl on the Train” were totally unlikable. This book takes place near London - the UK has a terrible drinking problem among young adult women and the main character’s (Rachel) problem with alcohol made her seem like a character on a bad Jerry Springer episode. The book swings back and forth between three young, hapless women as they careen through their desperate lives. The only psychological thrilling part of this book (for me) was the anticipation of whether or not I would finish the book… and, sadly, I did."
"1178",1177,"Jason","Disappointed"
"1179",1178,"Martin Oros","A big disappointment! It was obvious to me who the murderer was from halfway through the book. I did not like the heroine - a constantly peevish drunkard whining about her ex husband. A complete waste of time! "
"1180",1179,"Gerard Masilang","The Girl on the Train was a hot mess. Rachel, along with the other main and sub-characters were very hard to like. The author made the characters so flawed that they all seemingly could have committed the murder in a moment of passion or utter stupidity. Looking back at the novel I can appreciate this, but at times it was hard to want to read on further when you have no person to root for.I was talking to a girl before I read this novel and she said she predicted the ending 70% of the way through. No.You. Didn't. The other tips you off and the final third of the book is a very enjoyable showdown and conflict resolution. I am a fan of the not-so-fairytale ending which Hawkins delivers and the subtle character development of Rachel. She is a flawed human, like the rest of us struggling to battle our demons, hardships, and pitfalls. I can appreciate her not being able to pull herself up by the boot straps because that is not the reality in alcohol addiction and depression. I have seen rave reviews and harsh critiques of the book. I fall somewhere in the middle. Rachel lost her way and Spoiler Alert* her ex helped perpetuate her personal turmoil. With all the drunken missteps I can admire her for trying to find something to live for and find purpose in. Even if it is at first a fictitious fantasy couple.The book is a quick read and does a good job hiding the killer from the reader until the showdown where everything comes full circle.It's definitely not like Gone Girl, its closer to Sharp Objects if anything."
"1181",1180,"Bookworm","Another overly-hyped book I've never read Gone Girl but I was turned off by the hype and what seemed like a ridiculous amount of marketing surrounding the book and movie. Before I read this I was not aware of the comparisons, but in retrospect I wish I had read the reviews. This would be one to skip. Rachel is an alcoholic who rides the train every day to work. On her way she usually sees a couple at a particular place where her train stops due to a malfunction. She gave them names and writes a story about them in her head, giving them the happy life she never had. Then Rachel sees something that will forever change her life. Because the rest of it is the story from there, I do not want to give any more away. I found myself very turned off by the style of writing from the beginning. I enjoyed the division between the morning and evening commutes, but I disliked the split narratives in storytelling, by telling the story from the POV of different characters. I don't know if that hurt anything, but I found the characters shallow and one dimensional. The villain is the VILLIAN and it's a little hard to see how and why he could have so many women over the moon for him. Even towards the end the narrator discusses about how all she knew about him was lies. Sort of jamming home he was EVIL. We get it. As an idea this really appealed to me. I've been that commuter (not in London though) and I've occasionally seen things that make me question exactly what did I see and even if I could say something, I'm not sure any info I could provide would be helpful. This was the angle that appealed to me, but unfortunately it really did not pan out. Apparently Gone Girl fans would really like this one. I propose that the opposite that the opposite is true: If you disliked GG, you probably won't like this book either, but that's just me. I waited like 2 months to get it from the library, definitely wasn't worth it. It *might* be an enjoyable summer beach read for GG fans, but it's not the end of the world if you don't get to it."
"1182",1181,"Steve","I guess it was supposed to be like Gone Girl, except with an alcoholic lead character that would be impossible to sympathize with under any circumstances. Incredibly easy story to read but Hawkins wastes so much time with needless information that the story seems to drag on far too long. Couldn't have cared less once the big reveal came, disappointing cottage read."
"1184",1183,"Willem-jan Slaats","Gelezen met in het achterhoofd steeds de vraag waarom dit boek op nr. 1 in de thriller lijst van Vrij Nederland staat. Ik heb er geen antwoord op gekregen. Zeer oppervakkig boek met karakterloze peronages."
"1185",1184,"Torie","I didn't know wtf the book was about when I checked it out as an audiobook from the library, but I would rather sit in silence during my entire commute than listen to any more. My god. Rachel is a self-effacing, self-pitying, insufferable voyeur. Her chapters are the absolute worst. Megan is okay, but dull. The writing is bland and monotonous. I don't understand the hype."
"1186",1185,"Toria","The self-loathing of the protagonist wears thin very quickly, and the ending was a little predictable. Not a book I would recommend to anyone."
"1187",1186,"Uckan","Extremely overhyped."
"1188",1187,"eerickfirework","La chica del tren es una novela que viene precedida por un gran efecto boca en boca y una publicidad que al final se siente falsa. Es una historia que sonaba muy interesante y estaba bien encaminada pero es floja en cuanto a giros, misterios y sobre todo, el climax y la resolución no dan para sentir algún tipo de satisfacción por haberla terminado. No puedo negar que posee unos personajes bien logrados , oscuros y complejos pero que final todo es bastante predecible.No entiendo el hype hacia esta novela cuando hay muchas historias superiores a esta y que manejan una atmósfera realmente llena de tensión. Me decepciona que hasta Stephen King la recomiende porque al final con cumple con las expectativas. "
"1189",1188,"Shasta","This book was a waste of my time. The story starts out strong, but then the characters become so wrapped in dysfunctional behavior you start to lose sight of them as people and they begin to feel very fictional and made up. I skipped large portions of the book and got to end just to find out what happens. It was pretty predictable. Not a book I would recommend to anyone. But hey, to each their own!"
"1190",1189,"Jim Kjexrud","I might be in the wrong group of people this book is targeted for. But I decided to give it a shot after hearing so many positive words about it, and how it was so exciting. I waited and waited for something thrilling to happen but when I was around halfway through I couldn't read any further. A massive disappointment and a drag to get through in my case."
"1191",1190,"Denise Cumbus","2 depressing psycho women... no thank you!!"
"1192",1191,"Mariana","Really poor female characters that are mostly defined by the men in their lives. All points of view are unreliable because all women have issues, again, caused by the men in their lives. The unreliability of the main point of view, Rachel, is not caused by a crafted display of events that can be interpreted in different ways but because she is drunk. It becomes very easy to understand where the plot is going. Also women can only be friends if they are hating on the same man. It was a painful read, not expected of a summer best seller."
"1193",1192,"Christine Fortier","I admit, I could not finish this book. I forced myself to read the first quarter of the book, that was all I could handle. It was about a mentally unstable woman riding a train to and from work in a shambles of a world mind set. Out her window, she views homes, landscapes and such all the while giving life in her imagination to the lives of the people living there. It was just too depressing for me. The premise is excellent, but what the author intended and did with it was not for me. There are those I believe could empathize with the girl on the train. Understand where she is coming from. I could not. I wanted to shake some sense into her. Oh well, onto other more satisfying reads. "

I tried my best, but I felt the story was confusing, the pages redundant, the characters shallow and the drinking again and again and again and again....ad infinitum. It was all just too repetitive and my life just had to move on. I closed the book, and except for the fact that I made it over half way through before it got to be too much, I'll count it as a book read. Unhappily."
"1204",1203,"Jen Ackroyd","Huge disappointment. Every character is unlikeable and the plot is beyond boring. Kept waiting for some great plot twist but the one that came was predictable and anti climactic. Can't trust everything that's on the best seller list! "

Those creatures don't know what they are talking about.All who try to promote this kind of rubbish don't wish good things for humanity. They are trying to make you like something that has no value. Just because they say it is a great book, in fact the book of the year, doesn't mean it really is.I know many said it is alike the Gone Girl and they are right. It is just as bad. Because people who say that don't have an idea of what a thriller, a suspense or a mystery is.This is a deeply feminist book, written only from a feminist perspective, narrated by three twisted and morally perished characters. Somebody is on a train, or maybe not, drinking or maybe not, making love or maybe not, killing or maybe not. Make up your mind Hawkins!And again what is wrong with the goodreads choice awards? Maybe we should call that badchoice awards? Because this has won it this year... Stop believing in what you are told to believe and follow your own reason and hart. Please wake up! Please!"
"1207",1206,"Tanvir Muntasim","Ironically, I started and finished reading this on my daily commute. This book reminded me of 50 shades of Grey, in terms of its inexplicable popularity despite abysmal quality. The writing was slightly better (it isn't saying much), but the protagonists were even worse, all pathetic, obnoxious people deserving to be slapped silly every step of the way. The only reason I finished the book was to see if there are any redemptive features at the end. Alas, there wasn't. Even more surprising to know that it is being turned into a film, with A-class stars like Chris Evans and Emily Blunt attached to it. I can only shake my head at the state of popular taste and move on. One last thing, a lot of people compare this with Gone Girl, possible because both books have a missing woman with the husband being suspect there. The similarities end there. Gone Girl is a much more entertaining read than this one."
"1209",1208,"Dona","Because of all the buzz surrounding this book I couldn’t wait to read it. I tried, truly, to get involved in it but I found the book a real turn off. The characters were repugnant and the story line rambling and hard to follow. I found that I was pushing myself to read it and I’ve promised not to do that anymore so I stopped and went on to something else. Maybe it was just me – seems like lots of folks love this novel – but I wasn’t one of them."

Es un libro tan del montón que me extraña mucho que haya sobresalido de esta manera en el mercado. Incluso dudo de su género, porque a veces no sabía si estaba leyendo un dramón o un thriller. Los personajes son patéticos, todos ellos, y no funciona ninguno como un hilo conductor que invite a seguir leyendo. En cuanto al “misterio” en sí, pues tampoco tiene nada de especial. Como ya digo, novela del montón, personajes del montón e historia que se ha visto un millón de veces ya por ahí. No me hizo sentir ninguna emoción en especial. Bueno sí, que lo comparen con la maravilla que me pareció Gone Girl me parece increíble, pero bueno, para gustos están los colores. Por mi parte, no lo recomiendo, la verdad. Será por libros de misterio realmente buenos que hay ahí fuera."

"1222",1221,"Shehnila","With the intriguing premise and the comparisons to Gone Girl I had high hopes and was majorly disappointed. All the characters were ignoramuses. I hated them all. A caps lock kind of hate. If you're going to write about assholes, at least make them entertaining (something I thought Gone Girl did really well). The whole whodunnit aspect failed for me because I found almost all characters to be cardboard cutouts. The three narrative points we got from the three main female characters were almost indistinguishable and they were so ridiculously pitiful (notably in their interactions with men), that if I cared enough about what was going on I'd grab them by their shoulders and yell:IT'S DIGNITY LUANNE RACHEL, ANNA, MEGAN (they're all the same stupid character)Also the book just kind of ended. I closed it and was unimpressed by everything. The high ratings this gets are beyond me because I think the author is a slight step up from EL James. Does this book even pass the Bechdel test?"
"1223",1222,"Diana Clarke","This is a well written book about three messed up women and the men in their lives. I'm reading it for a book group & I'm really worried I'll be the only one hating it... and I'll have to wonder if I can be friends with anyone who likes it!I listened to it on a long car ride. I figured out ""who dun it"" early in the trip/book. Every character in this book makes bad choices and most of them are mentally ill, as well. The author does an exceptionally great job capturing the hell of the delusional black out alcoholic, who is the main character. It's well done because it's so authentic. Very depressing. If you've lived among any people with these mental illnesses, you'll see the ending coming. I do not understand the hype & fascination with this book. I read to escape this kind of reality/fiction!"

I'm not naive enough to think that there aren't people/situations like this in the world but I just don't choose to spend my time polluting my mind with their misery. I guess this book hit all the targets if you're looking for a few hours of depression, misanthropy and the navel gazing of self obsessed psychopaths but I'd rather spend the time in a book travelling to places and meeting people who inspire and uplift me...the real world is what I am trying to escape from!"

They're even going to make it into a movie I heard. I was expecting an exciting, gripping read, but a third into the novel I was still waiting for the plot to become interesting and I was far from gripped. It was more a case of plodding on because there must be something good coming up that makes so many people rave about it? I finished the book, but I must have missed the thrilling bit - yes, it's classified as a thriller, but it's actually very slow moving with only one short episode at the end where there is some suspense. Too bad, I really looked forward to reading it."
"1233",1232,"Russ Nickel","I feel like since Gone Girl, all these sorts of mysteries have been downhill for me. It may be more personal than objective, but these tales of damaged suburban women thrust into murder plots have become a study in tedium. They're character driven, yes, but the characters in all these books feel oddly similar in their suburban way.As for this book specifically, I simply found myself unable to care. There was little plot, and the only thing that ever threw us off the track (so to speak) was the protagonist's own faulty interpretation of events.Also, a huge pet peeve of mine is when memory loss stories use recovered memory as a convention, and this book is one of the worst perpetrators of this crime, which, in this case, is a far worse crime than the murder contained therein. You see, whenever the plot stalls, the protagonist can simply remember the next piece of critical information. It's all far too convenient, and it makes the reader feel as though he's simply waiting for that moment to arrive.The author also had to work very hard to find reasons for the protagonist to show up at the relevant area.

It was number 2 on the list and looked to be a quick read, so why not? I love thrillers, but this book did not thrill. It was predictable and cliché. The protagonist is boring and deeply flawed. I should have gone with my first instinct which was how can someone take something as mundane as a girl on a train and make it thrilling? Paula Hawkins did not succeed and I doubt anyone really could. "

Once I was 100 pages in and realized it wasn't going to get any better, I read a few other reviews a la ""completely changes the way you look at other people's lives yadayadayada"". Driven by the the fact that I felt like I must be missing something, I decided to trudge on and finish the thing.I didn't like any of the characters - I suppose that was the point - but none of them were written in that deeply complex way that makes their flaws relatable or interesting by any means. Thankful to finally have finished the book and have it behind me.Read this if a cheap psychological thrill is worth wading through characters so shallow, all they can talk about is how much they like the sound of trains - the descriptions of which are equally shallow.

If it’s not the drinking, it’s her obsession with Tom, which might I add, if he wasn’t the killer, she would still be obsessed with him and trying to get back with him to the end of time.Anna is even more terrible, you enjoy being a mistress? You enjoy destroying lives? Because that’s what being a mistress is, you find a person who’s already in a committed relationship and then steal them away.Megan, where do I even start? She was a kid, I’m not gonna blame her for killing the baby, even though I really want to BECAUSE WHO TAKES A BATH WITH A KID WHEN YOU KNOW YOU’RE NOT 100% AWAKE AND FEELING GOOD?!! And then basically trying to balance 3 different relationships with 3 different guys ( yes I’m dragging Kamal into this) because she was bored? and dragging another pregnancy into her already a mess of a life?Kamal who should KNOW better, once he saw that Megan was interested in him, he should’ve cut her off! Once she visited him in his house the first time, he should’ve transferred her case to someone else, but nope, he’s a guy after all, it’s in his stupid nature.Scott who is a terrible excuse of a human being, sleeping with someone days after they find out his wife body? And then attacking her? WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE LIVE IN THIS TOWN?I could seriously write a whole book on why everything in this book is just wrong and terrible but I don’t want to invest so much energy in something negative, more than I already did anyway.

There was no connection to any character, no like-able people, (except maybe Detective Gaskill and baby Evie).....just hollow, stupid, selfish, or absolute narcissistic psychopaths. I read a book for pleasure, people. I want to feel something. What I don't want to feel is irritated and bored. And the comparison with Gone Girl is just absurd.

As I was talking to people, both in real life and on GR I was finding out that most people that read what I read thought it was ok, or even had wished they didn't finish it. So it was with great trepidation that I went into the book and I knew that if it couldn't hold my interest I was going to give it up.I made it through about 30% before giving it up. I hated Rachel, thought she was a whiny bitch who needed to get over herself. Was her husband wrong for cheating on her yes, but at some point you need to try to get on with your life and make a new one. Megan I was so so on. I didn't like that she was hiding so much from her husband, especially because it didn't seem like the things one needed to hide. I gave up when Rachel realized that Megan was the woman missing, not the person she made up stories about. I realized that I didn't really care what was going on.

"1275",1274,"Jean Coldwell","Let me first start by saying that I did not finish this book. I tried. I got to 30% of the Kindle version, and even though at that point the “action” had started, I just could not bear to continue. Many of the people in my Goodreads “Good Thriller” group had read or planned to read this book, and most had given it high praise. Some reviewers compared it to Gone Girl. That should have been my first clue; I somehow managed to finish that one and immediately wished I hadn’t.I was confused by the characters. I honestly could discern very little, if any, difference between the voices of Rachel and Megan (who, early on, is imagined to be “Jess” by Rachel, who sees her from the train and makes up a story about her life). I did not like these people. Rachel was an alcoholic divorcee, and I could not garner any sympathy for her. Megan was a stay-at-home wife with little to do but go to therapy and sleep around. Then there was Anna, the new wife and mother of Rachel’s ex-husband, Tom. I didn’t really have any feelings about her at all.Then Megan disappeared, and the police showed up to question Rachel, who could not remember a single thing about that night because she had been very, very drunk. I did not like Megan or Rachel, and the drama in their lives just seemed to go on and on. I was mildly curious about what happened, but I didn’t enjoy the writing enough to want to continue reading. Normally, I would have struggled through it, at least to perhaps the halfway point, but there are so many other novels I have yet to read, so I am giving this one a rest. My apologies to those who really enjoyed this, but it simply was not a pleasant experience for me.One star"

Then Rachel sees their married neighbour, Megan Hipwell, from the train window kissing a man who turns out to be her therapist. When Megan goes missing, the secrets of her life reveal a startling link to Rachel’s own… I couldn’t finish this so-called “thriller”. It’s not a long book either at just over 300 pages but, some two weeks of picking it up, reading a few miserable pages, and quickly putting it down again, I’m ready to admit defeat at the 180 page mark. Paula Hawkins’ novel is full of seedy, unlikeable people in a “plot” that reads like an overlong episode of Eastenders. Rachel’s ex Tom and his missus Anna argue with Rachel in the street while Megan’s cheating on her husband Scott who argue at home and Cathy, Rachel’s housemate, wants her to get help, and blah blah blaaaaah who finds this interesting!? No real story appears until well over the halfway mark and even then it’s really only the hint of one. Most of the time it’s this soap-opera dogshit as the dimwits bicker like the dreary suburbanites like they are about dull nonsense. Paula Hawkins’ writing is pedestrian at best, rendering it all in flat, un-evocative prose. Quite why The Girl on the Train is such a runaway hit, I have no idea. It’s tedious claptrap of the lowest order. Then again Eastenders is incredibly popular too so there’s probably a crossover between those audiences. Don’t listen to anyone who compares this crap to Gone Girl, they are nothing alike and at least Gillian Flynn can write. Exhausting and boring, The Girl on the Train is a total waste of time."

The end of the book tied up the mystery cleanly. The reason this book was so unpleasant to read is that the main character, and actually all of the characters are total messes. It is so painful to read about how Rachel is destroying her life. The one bright spot in reading this that it provides some empathy for people with substance abuse problems. The lack of ability to make good decisions for themselves is painful to watch. The writing is actually done reasonably well, the characters are not to my taste. If you like reading about depressing situations and people who make poor choice, after poor choice, after poor choice, then you might really like this book.

Because clearly, we don't care. you have yours and I have mine./This just was just not my cup of tea. Don't tell me ""I don't see your name with a book out there."" Sure I'll write one. It'll be as shitty because anyone nowadays can write a book and get published... like for example: kardashians... wtf? Way to make the title of the book, obvious. So due to her actions of riding the train and being a spectator to Megan's infidelity, she immediately gets involved? I just didn't understand the concept = of meddling to people who you don't even know. Then somehow the story develops that ""Oh hey, the killer was actually my ex-husband."" Nothing of the plot and character's development made any sense. There was no direction of where they were going. The climax happened near the end of the book which made no sense because shouldn't it be that happens in the middle....? I just felt that I had to finish the damn book for the sake of my reading challenge. I admit I anticipated in reading this to see what the fuss was about and if it was as good as gone girl but to my disappointment it wasn't. There was poor character development, I was bored. The three women were just messed up - Megan wasn't even involved with Rachel and Anna involved for a short time. The only thing I got out of it was that they are involved with Tom... and what is up with the appearance of the red-haired, Andy? :/He was just so out of place.. This book is as a hot mess as the three women in the book. Not to mention... seeing that this is published, there aren't a lot of grammatical errors, but what is up with ""A undisclosed man"" couldn't you have used ""An undisclosed man"" it would mean the same thing of showing a singuar person and the ""A"" makes the sentence so awkward to read. In my opinion.I wouldn't even classify this as a thriller... I was just bored throughout it all.. regardless, I just could care less about the characters and what they did. They all equally irritated and annoyed the shit out of me - instead of acting their age they all fucking act like teenagers.

A quick read, though not all that compelling. Ultimately forgettable, nothing special. Glad to have it read and to get back to reading GOOD books."

"1346",1345,"Marie France","Alors pour Le coupLe ""thriller de l'année"" est de la vraie littérature de gare.

"1349",1348,"Yvonne","This book was a waste of time. All the characters are self absorbed neurotics. I kept reading, hoping to find some grain of goodness somewhere, but it was ugly throughout. There may be a group of people out there like these individuals, but I don't know any, and don't want to know any. Depressing. I'm curious about why the author chose to write this; I hope it's not a reflection of today's world."
"1350",1349,"Allison Mckenzie","The characters in this book are unlikable and I couldn't relate to any of them. All of the book, minus the last couple of chapters, can be summed up by this: There's an alcoholic woman who can never remember anything when she drinks. But she keeps drinking. Only are the last couple of chapters any different. That's where the entire story is, the last couple of chapters. Everything before that was just setting the stage. But to get through that stage setting.... It took me months and months. It's tedious, boring, and this may be only the second book I ever regret reading. "
"1351",1350,"Alicia Steadman","Awful, there was absolutely nothing I liked about this book. This book was actually painful for me to read - sooooo boring, but I followed it to the end. Whiny, flawed, selfish, characters who are all jerks who should have died horrible deaths....because they were that stupid. Don't get me started on the narrator, equally as bad as the damn characters...maybe the narrator was drunk. The writing was monotonously mediocre in my opinion. Those who compare it to Gone Girl, need to read more. Complete waste of my time."
"1352",1351,"Cindi","There wasn't much to like here at all. Again, I am surprised by the number of readers who give this book 5 stars!The characters are hot messes and I didn't want to spend any time with any one of them. As for the mystery, it didn't really seem to me that there was one. Maybe this is because I didn't really care about it, or because it wasn't difficult to figure out ""who done it.""My recommendation - don't waste your time with this one."

"1357",1356,"John Soria","Women are irrational and dramatic. They have a knack for getting themselves into very bad situations due to their innate ignorance of danger. With a flair for the dramatic, they may often find themselves following the whims of their fantasies simply to find purpose an meaning, even within the affairs of others. Being naturally spiteful, their interactions with other women are especially vindictive. It is only when they are in a relationship with a man, whether it's healthy or not, that they can be truly respected and at their best. They may have to ignore adulterous, violent, and sometimes murderous tendencies from those men, but at least they're able to function properly.Often when I hear that someone ""hates women"" due to a statement or specific viewpoint, I am completely turned off to that opinion and meet it with an eye-roll. I don't automatically assume that a man hates women simply because of any one thing he says or does, even out of perversion or lust. However, if an entire book is written where not a single female character is likable or has redeeming qualities, or doesn't do anything honorable, or can't be happy without a man, then I have to wonder about the author. Is this really his view of what women are like? I understand that there are plenty of men out there who feel this way, but I was surprised to see how many reviewers I'd seen, mostly women, love this book when it seems, in this day and age, to be a national pastime to point out those who represent women in this way. But then again, the author is a woman.Does she get a pass because of her gender? Is that how it works? I sincerely want to know, because I may have completely misunderstood the rules. But let me continue this review without this element. Let's assume that all these characters are real and have somehow all found each other and start sleeping together like a season of Beverly Hills 90210. Let's accept this reality for now.I knew before the first chapter was over that I would not like this book from the writing style alone. Written in short, dramatic sentences, it very wearing on me, and it only got worse as the book went along. While I don't mind a dramatic build, this was not a build. It was a constant flow of short, incomplete thoughts meant to add drama. Was this in a 'noir' style? Journalistic, maybe? No, it was just sloppy and it didn't flow well at all. But I suppose if you don't pay close attention to the style, maybe it won't bother you. So I'll move on.There is a certain art to writing a mystery or a thriller. You cannot simply withhold information and expect it to be thrilling. If not done properly, it does nothing but irritate the reader. You have to provide suspense. Intrigue. You have to give us something we don't expect, either throughout the story, at the end, or both. But most of all, you have to make us care about either the solution or the unraveling. I'm not going to tell you that you should or shouldn't care about something. You'll have your own opinions on the matter. But for me, I really couldn't care less about this... ""mystery,"" I guess we'll call it. The answer seemed very apparent as soon as the question was asked. I continued my reading, thinking that maybe the author would give me, as I hoped, the unexpected. However, the ending went only to where I thought we were going in the first place, and that was extremely disappointing. The road to get us there was equally disappointing. The author conveniently uses memory loss and recovery to provide the necessary clues to solving the puzzle, which to me is akin to saying ""Aliens"" at the end of a movie. Too easy. Not enough effort.Now, let's go back to the characters. If these characters are realistic and probable, then the main problem is that I just don't care about them. They are all awful people who do awful things that made me feel uncomfortable and awkward in the worst ways. There are three perspectives through which the story is told, and each one of them is just as awful as the next. It's not just that they're terrible people, which they are. It's not even that they are so over-the-top irrational that they do things no normal person would do. It's that EVERY character in this book was that way! As I learned about each individual, it started to become apparent that the clumsy formation of characters was the only way this story could work. I mean, even the police woman, Riley, was vindictive and spiteful WHEN THERE WAS NO REASON FOR HER TO BE aside from providing more tension for the story overall. But when you have a male and a female detective working a case, of course it's got to be the man who is kind and understanding, right? And Rachel's mom... she wouldn't let Rachel stay with her because of her ""new friend,"" and we know how restrictive women get when they are around men.. Even the most centered female character, Rachel's roommate, only has lunch with her because her boyfriend is out of town, and leaves the restaurant the minute she learns he has returned. How many stereotypes about women did the author need to fill the pages? I could have accepted much easier if there were fewer characters like this, and I'm talking one or two tops. Maybe it makes the story more interesting or, at worst, you can disregard that element altogether. But when you build the foundation of your story on top of it, then it bleeds throughout the entire thing, making the whole book meaningless. And that's how I feel about this book. It meant nothing, and only served to waste my time.Sadly, I could go on with many more reasons for hating this book. But I don't want to waste more time on it than I have to, and I'm already going to talk more about it for a book club (which is the only reason I didn't stop reading it in the first place). I don't tell people they are wrong for things they like. I sincerely hope that if you've read this book, you found enjoyment from it. Though I wish this author the best in her career, I would not be able to bring myself to read any of her future writings."
"1359",1358,"A.J. Davidson","I gave up after reading a third of this 'page-turner'. Off to do something much more interesting such as cutting my toenails. A marketing triumph, a literary bore. "
"1362",1361,"Leah Davis","This was a really stupid book. If you were expecting Gone Girl, you will be disappointed. Heck, if you were expecting a good book you will be disappointed. I don't get why it had such rave reviews. Nonexistent plot. No characters that you care about. A story that you essentially figure out about halfway through. The ""unexpected"" things we learn along the way truly have nothing to do with with the ultimate story. I'm glad I read this as a library book and didn't spend actual money buying it. "
"1363",1362,"Scott","So this is the ""it"" book of the year and it was a definite DNF. I think this is only the 3rd book since I joined goodreads 3 years ago that I have not finished but I just couldn't go on. Maybe it's because I read Gone Girl to the end (and learned my lesson) but I hated every single character in this book. People toss around the word hate but I serious loathed, despised, hated every single character and there are just too many great books with great characters out there for me to spend 8 hours with these characters.Some may give me crap for even giving a rating for a book I did not finish but my ratings are based on my enjoyment level of the book and this one would get negative stars if Goodreads allowed me."
"1364",1363,"Emily Shearer","Save yourself some time and skip this book. ""Psychological thriller""? ""Cautionary tale""? More like depressing rehashing of same-old predictable plot, pitiable, mesh-thin characters and overused tropes. "
"1365",1364,"Dawn Swanson","Seriously, can this book be more pathetic, and cliche? About three very weak, catty, stupid and mean women who will sleep with each others husbands, not care a thing about each other or themselves, spend too much time drinking, and screwing each other, other men, and then somehow in the very end manage to stand up and kill the murderer--not because they've grown, or because they found strength, or anything, they just did. How lucky are they?Is this what American women are?"
"1366",1365,"Kathleen Frank","The end finally put me out of my misery. Worst read so far this summer. Repetitive scenes over and over, I hoped for some redemption after big hype I had received on how great this was. Very poor character development and drunken scenes that make no sense. I sure won't be seeing the movie!"
"1367",1366,"Brad","whoever said that this was a British Gone Girl should be punched in the face. The plot twist/revelation is obvious miles away"
"1368",1367,"Angela Connolly","Terrible plot, badly written.This could well be the worst book I have ever read. I saw the plot 'twist' coming a mile.None of the characters are likeable, or even remotely believable. The plot is a very basic whodunnit, but by the end of the book you don't actually care."
"1369",1368,"Lara","Very Talented writer, but the main characters are so unsympathetic and self-absorbed that I couldn't get invested in their stories. After countless poor decisions, I just stopped caring."
"1371",1370,"Robyn Franzen","I have no idea why everyone is talking about this book like it's the next ""Gone Girl."" It was a long, drawn out wait for something interesting to happen. I read reviews about some insane plot twist like ""Gone Girl"" and the entire time i'm waiting and expecting something crazy to happen and what ends up happening is utterly predictable. It could have been much shorter too if the author had left out unnecessary passages. I just really did not enjoy this book"
"1372",1371,"April Click","Deplorable. From one sketchy narrator to the next - the story line was hard to follow and awash with unclear purpose. The dates before the chapter are hard to follow, I found myself more than once flipping back to find out exactly where in the story line I was. Told from the viewpoints of 3 women, all whom are weak and possess little backbone to think or do anything for themselves. Traveling through their terrible psyche and failing relationships paired with abuse of alcohol, sex, and unhealthy relationships. ""thriller""? Not even in the slightest. Just a sad, sad story with half-assed character development and a plot that is so muddy I couldn't wait to get to the end of the book so I can go back to reading something worthy of my time."
"1373",1372,"Montessahall","This book reminds me of Gone Girl and I didn't like that book either. For some odd reason, lately I have been unlucky in my selection of books to enjoy. From the hype over this book, I was looking forward to a powerful reading experience. Wow, was I disappointed! Still, I finished the book so I could cross it off my reading list."

"1379",1378,"Jamie Sommer","Honestly, there was a lot of hype about this book, and after much coercion, I read it. Well. It was intensely disappointing, especially after the raving reviews, I expected a lot more. Messed up characters, poor development of these characters, predictable plot, and not as thrilling as has been suggested. "
"1383",1382,"Manisha","Read for the 2015 Reading Challenge: A mystery or thrillerThis book was horrible, it was so confusing and had major plot holes. All the characters were a hot mess. I don't understand how so many people gave it 5 stars. I couldn't wait for the book to finish honestly."
"1384",1383,"Maureen Wattelet","Terrible. I cannot understand all of the hype behind this book. I couldn't even finish it. I finally got SO sick of the narrator constantly whining. It's one thing to have a ""sympathetic"" character. It's another to have a character that is so wallowing in self-pity that you begin to hate them - let alone want to hear their story. I can't believe anyone would want to put up with her."
"1389",1388,"Mike Daly","I really tried to get into this one. It took me forever to read. It frequently draws comparisons to Gone Girl in reviews but to my way of thinking it doesn't come close. Just not a book for me."
"1391",1390,"Ronson Brown","261. Two hundred and sixty one pages. That's how long it took this book to be interesting. Everybody told me ""the ending of the book is so good, just wait."" I waited, and yes, it was a very well written ending but damn, one should not have to wait through 80% of a book to get to a point of actual enjoyment. I disliked every character so much, I wanted them all to be the killer. If this book had of been another 50 pages longer, I would have thrown it under an oncoming train. 90% of this book gets a 1/5. Skip the book, maybe the movie will offer some kind of stimulating visual medium. Want a good murder mystery thriller? Lars Kepler. That'll be my next read. "
"1393",1392,"Natalie Brandt","Very forgettable. Author must not drink a lot of alcohol or be around people who are heavy drinkers because she had her alcoholic lead character blacking out after two bottles of wine. Two bottles of wine? Light weight. "
"1394",1393,"David Barbee","Reading this book was like watching a fly at a window. The characters are completely static and one dimensional; their flaws initially interesting, but not enough to keep the book interesting. The lack of character growth made the middle of the book tedious, and became even more frustrating as the book concluded.I had a hard time identifying with any of the characters, and the story advanced to the beat of ""WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?!?!"" in my head.I'm not sure why I continued reading this book, but it's done now!"
"1396",1395,"April Miller","The book had ramshackle plot, the writing was not good, in my opinion. Too much ado about nothing......the long lists ofHolds at the library must have been just frenzy, did anyone actually ever Personally get a good recommendation of this book?Very disappointed........"

"1407",1406,"Ahk","This was called the Gone Girl of 2015 and I didn't like Gone Girl, so I was stupid to read this. For what it's worth, Gone Girl was better. "
"1408",1407,"Marnie","This one was to depressing for me. Every single character was an emotional wreck in one way or another , and in all honesty I would have stopped reading it altogether if I didn't had to finish it for book club.I literally had to make myself sit down and say, okay one hour then you can do something fun. I will say that the last 10% of the book was easier to get through, but only because of the realisation that everything is drawing to a conclusion.There is a number of things that annoyed me endlessly.The fact that the characters were so very much the same, that they all just felt something or knew that something bad will happen - did they all participated in a Shop experiment dealing with ""Lot 6""?Even in near death experiences they feel and see the same thing, I mean really. Another thing was all the self-pitying going around. Could there really not be one semi-stable person in this story? In the end even the male characters are labelled crazy, or strong on their way to crazy town.There is one positive point I would like to make: In an accomplished director's hands; this will make a very good movie. One of those rare one's were the movie is better than the book."
"1411",1410,"Albert Riehle","DNFThis book is terrible. I have no idea why so many people seem to like it. "
"1412",1411,"Chuck Wright","I gave this book as many chances as I could. I stopped reading it several times and kept picking it back up. It continued to disappoint. In the end I couldn't slog through the the main character fucking up her life any longer and I gave up. Apparently there was a mystery somewhere in there that I was supposed to care about, but I just couldn't make it. I don't at all understand the popularity of this book. "
"1413",1412,"Annie Liu","None of the characters is likeable - all the males are abusive and deceptive and all females are weak and pathetic. The little bit of suspense was unsurprising and can't justify the time wasted."
"1414",1413,"Dangerouskiwi","After about 1/3rd of the book I started skimming parts of it. After two thirds I skipped more and more and stuck to reading the dialogue just to see if there were any surprises in there. There weren't. This was pretty painful to read. The characters were depressing and pitiful and I'm glad I don't have to read their insane thoughts anymore. Cheers!"
"1415",1414,"Kaylee Herrera","I really thought I would NEVER get through this book. It kept dragging on, to the point where a little over halfway through the book, I was wanting to just stop reading all together. I was over it! In the end- I finally finished! This book starts off promising, quickly becomes rather boring, more boring, and finally picks up the pace with the ending (which is the best part of the book). If the entire story had the same suspense & thrills that the ending has, it definitely would have received more than one star from me.  I picked this book because of so many reviews comparing it to Gone Girl. Some are saying if you love GG you'll love this book, & that is simply not true. I can KIND OF see similarities in the two, but it definitely does not compare in amazingness."
"1416",1415,"Xinh","So, I'm giving up on this book. I got as far into as I could go and then just lost interest. Even reading the ending didn't make me want to go back and finish it."
"1417",1416,"Cynthia C Kiefer","This is the most overrated book ever! Don't waste your time. This story could and should have been written in half the time. Dragged on way too long. "
"1419",1418,"Kira","DNF at 31%. IDK why people compare this to Gone Girl. The only thing similar about them is that you hate the characters. In Gone Girl the characters were smart and manipulative. These characters are just pathetic wastes of space. The storyline is very slow moving. I'm too bored to finish this."
"1421",1420,"Rita","Bland and too predictable."
"1422",1421,"Katherine","This is getting compared to Gone Girl? REALLY? I thought the mystery was boring and I can't tell if it's because I felt like it was contrived (the mystery hinging on Rachel's alcoholic blackouts was the opposite of riveting) or if it's just that the author's writing/prose is really lackluster. If each section didn't start out with the narrator's name, I'd have a hard time differentiating the characters. They all sound exactly the same. As for the Gone Girl comparisons, only the surface elements are similar - missing wife, unreliable narrator, unlikable characters. But Gone Girl offers a way more complex and interesting study of its characters, whereas the characters in The Girl on the Train feel flimsy and one-dimensional despite all their problems. I lol'd when the villain ended up monologuing and explaining everything at the end. ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ."

"1429",1428,"Claire","Wow, I was really disappointed by this book. The premise was good but the story telling was lacking. I didn't like the characters. I didn't like how the book was structured, I was a little confused. Too many POV. I think Chevy Stevens is a better thriller story teller. When the reveal happened, I found I didn't care and I wasn't shocked. "
"1430",1429,"Denise Butti","Didn't care for this book. Not interested in reading about someone with so many problems. Wasn't worth my time."
"1431",1430,"Laura Gerber","Not my favorite read. Reminded me a lot of Gone Girl only not as good or as attention grabbing. To slow moving. I did not really become in engaged until three quarters through. By that time I just wanted to finish the book already. This is one book I would not recommend. "
"1432",1431,"Sadie Townsend","I'm really quite disappointed in this book, I was so excited to read it mostly due to all the high praise and amazing reviews I've seen. It's hardly 'unputdownable' - the opposite in fact. My main issue with the novel is that, considering it's supposed to be a thriller, I found the whole plot so predictable. It's so easy to guess what the main characters will do next, and when you've worked out everything's that's going to happen and you've still got half the novel left, it's makes for a very dull read. Also, in terms of the characters they were all so unlikable. I'm not saying you need to have likeable characters for a book to be successful, but it certainly helps if you feel a connection to them. I didn't really care whether any of them lived or died. It's not just because they are 'dark' or 'corrupted' characters either. Gillian Flynn writes about extremely twisted, conflicted characters yet still manages to make the audience emotionally invest in them and like them. Overall I would not recommend this book to others, the idea is good but just not executed very well. "
"1433",1432,"Brittany Elena Morris","I, frankly, was really disappointed with this book and can't seem to grasp why it's as popular as it is. While the plot is thrilling and suspenseful, I think that is its only redeeming quality. Each woman in this book was awful - they're weak and define themselves wholly by the man they are with, or not with. This is not a positive reflection of a modern woman who -- more often than not -- is self sufficient, has a fruitful career and is marrying later in life, if at all. Why would a female author want to concoct such distasteful female characters? It tarnishes the way women are perceived; Hawkins has us believe women are always vulnerable, abuse alcohol and will sacrifice their moral standing for a comfortable life at home with children. Although the women ultimately ~ come out on top ~, little time is spent on the women's redemption. Aside from creating completely unrealistic and unappealing characters, the novel was predictable and had way too many adverbs. "
"1434",1433,"Amie Koporc","I had high hopes for this book, but was really disappointed. None of the characters are likable. I found them so flawed that I didn't really care what happened to them. Still not clear if the person of interest's name was cleared. Seems like a bad plot for a Lifetime movie."
"1435",1434,"J. ","Wow. It says a lot that I fully think that Daisy Buchanan would be disgusted by these women. In short, this is the story of three women who try to rip themselves and each other apart for complete ass-pricks of men. "
"1436",1435,"Paul Frost","Very predictable from the outset.Written in a similar style to the first half of (the far superior) Gone Girl - switching POV narrative of the main female characters & back & forth in time between the victim prior to her murder & the present day remaining characters. Unlike Gone Girl - this technique seems very laboured & gets very tedious.None of the characters are particularly well fleshed out, by the end I got to hoping the murderer of the original victim would kill the rest of the women and the men & then commit suicide - no sympathy for any of them."

"1451",1450,"arabella bishop","Again, bestsellers and massly-adored books are not my cup of tea. I should have learnt it by now, but no. I keep making the same mistake over and over again. This time I wasted some day reading The Girl on the Train.The Girl on the Train is boring. Not catchy, not gripping, you can put it down whenever you feel like it won't haunt you and won't make your imagination fly and your thoughts about finding out the truth. This book is full of clichés, no surprising twists at all, the main character is unbelievably stupid and I just cannot feel sympathy for her. It was boring from the start to the beginning, the storyline is weak, the writing is simple, the characters are quite one dimensional. And the end?! Boring, boring, boring, no surprise at all. I have struggled trough the book I finished it only to be able to criticize it afterwards. I still cannot believe the success this book is having all around the world. It's not even good for summer read - unless you want to fell asleep quickly. "

Everyone in this book is a mess, and not in an interesting ""Gone Girl"" sort of way, but in an annoying, I-wish-you'd get-on-with-it sort of way. The three women who are the protagonists are all THE MOST illogical human beings in the world. It isn't very believable. ""Oh look! That guy might be a murderer! I'm going to go to his house to hang out."" The worst part about this book is that pretty much all the men are physically abusive and all the women say/think/believe that they somehow ""led them to it"" or ""provoked them"" to it and feel the need to ""apologize"" for it, even at the very end of the book. It's pretty revolting. "

The saddest part about this book being on the best seller list for weeks, is that it is most likely there because of women readers. And, this is the WORST book ever!! It totally makes women look like idiots!! It was so predictable. It diminishes women all together!! I have never felt so strongly about disliking a book....especially one that so many people/women love. Please, ladies..... give yourselves some credit!!! How can anyone be so stupid????

Not a fan of this at all, would not recommend.Oh, and the narration was terrible. It wasn't executed well, having the different characters narrate the events.

"1475",1474,"Tia Goodnight","Psychological thriller? No The ""next Gone Girl""? Hell no, are you people crazy?I was disappointed all around in this book, I had to force myself to keep reading it despite the clunky writing, unbelievably flat characters, and the uninspired plot. I mean really. Hawkins tried to write a gritty twisty thriller but really fell short, I was not at all intrigued by the story or characters. It felt less like a 'psycholog thriller' and more like a journal of a few messy lives crossing paths. And I'm really just so over the infidelity plotline. One thing that really bothered me was the man/baby as defining traits for the women. Outside of who they are in relationships to the men, there's not much else to the main characters; and that's especially disappointing coming from a female author in 2015. I truly don't understand the 5 star reviews."
"1476",1475,"Carolyn Mck","I was very disappointed in this novel. Hawkins starts out with an interesting premise - the woman who watches from the train, remembering her failed marriage and idealising the relationship of the couple she calls 'Jess and Jason'. Rachel has the potential to be an interesting character and she has experienced something alarming that she can't remember because she was drunk - again. Then 'Jess' is declared missing and there is a mystery to solve.For me, this falls between two genres - that of a relationships novel and that of a mystery. It succeeds in neither. I plodded through the first half because I did want to know what became of Megan (Jess) but the poor quality of the writing and the threadbare characterisation made me skip through the rest. I did find the solution but I can't see why there has been such support for this book. Instead of allowing the characters to unfold and lead the action, the author remains strictly in control and failed to convince me at every turn. "
"1479",1478,"Katy","High expectations but hugely disappointed... Each character a variation of the other -- all with very predictably messed up lives. Much as I want to put it down and move on to something more worth my time, I'm sticking with it to see how it ends -- predictable as that may be. Go figure."
"1481",1480,"Sharvani Raghunath","Well... publishers and reviewers seriously need to stop labelling every ""thriller"" written by a female author or from a female POV as ""the next Gone Girl"". Honestly. It set the bar wayyyyy too high and when i read this book, I was let down by the clumsy writing, the desperate, needy, insecure characters (Yes, each and every one of them), an antagonist who confesses, or rather explains everything right at the end, and the fact that all the women in this book are defined by their roles as wives/mothers.This is clearly an example of a good concept implemented in a very embarassing way."
"1484",1483,"Simplystated","Eh. Maybe it's all the hype about the book and it couldn't live up to it? Though the idea is pretty great and the movie will probably be decent I did not find any of the characters especially likable. I also did not care for the diary style writing (personal preference, I suppose). I was really excited to read the book but pretty disappointed when I did. In fact I figured it out by mid book, checked to see if I was right (I was) and just returned it to the library. "

"1487",1486," Mary","No entiendo cuál es el gran revuelo de este libro!!Para mí fue una decepción; la primera mitad se me hizo eterna y es bastante deprimente. Luego de la desaparición de Megan se pone un poquito más ágil y tal vez un poco más interesante; sí se supone que la identidad del asesino de Megan tenía que ser una sorpresa... no funcionó conmigo, me resultó predecible y ni siquiera una historia digna de destacar. Es difícil sentir empatía por algún personaje, me sentí como una espectadora mirando como para la historia; Rachel no me inspiro nada, ni lastima , ni pena, nada, es una mujer que debido a las circunstancias y su estado mental se dejó manipular por su marido sin ser consciente de ello. Con respecto a Megan, se comprensible el trauma del pasado que ella acarrea pero su conducta deja mucho que desear, no se merecía lo que le pasa pero honestamente que esperaba que pasara. Tom, es un manipulador que manipula a las tres mujeres en su vida para sentirse más importante, es patético. Scott, es un Tom en potencia y vaya a saber de lo que sería capaz de hacer si se le da tiempo. Incluso los policías, especialmente la mujer, se dejan llevar por los estereotipos a la hora de investigar, me falta Anna, ella vivía con lo Tom le decía y no cuestionaba nada, lo que aumentaba el ego de Tom, puede que haya sido amor pero no solamente es ella la que está en riesgo sino su hija.Se ha comparado mucho este libro con ""Perdida"" y la verdad que prefiero a ""Perdida"" y eso que no me gustó.Al final, tal vez hubiera estado mejor que Tom matara a Rachel y que Anna viviera con el miedo de que la próxima podría ser ella... Tal vez hubiera sido un final más retorcido y digno de la controversia y notoriedad que ha recibido el libro.Para mí todos los personajes de este libro necesitan ayuda psiquiátrica."

I only finished reading it, because I thought there should be something really good. Whole book I was hoping to turn the page and something would happen, something would blow me away and I will fall in love with the story. Well, soon, the book was finished and none of that had happened. I didn't connect with the story at all. The main character was so unattractive, well, all characters were. I found it quite boring and apart drinking every single day, the girl didn't do anything exciting. The whole crime and investigation seemed unrealistic and at some points hilarious. It's been a couple of weeks since I've finished reading and funnily enough, I can't even remember how it ended. All in all, the book was rubbish, but I would watch a film if it's going to be released. I am really hoping it will be better than a book. "

The word 'leaden' appears upteen dozen times and hearts were beating 'in my chest' (because where else are they going to beat?) I don't know how many times either. It's terribly overwritten - the three female narrators are about as subtle as a trio of flashing neon signs outside a strip club as they go about telling you their every movement, thought, feeling and emotion (don't look for any subtext here). The imagery and figurative language (when it's used) never ventures out of cliche lane. The only explanation I have for this book's inexplicable appeal is the actual premise of 'the girl on the train', and the cutting back and forth of the three women's stories that eventually (thank heavens) culminates in the killer (who you can spot a mile off) getting his comeuppance. The twist? Death by corkscrew. The fact that none of the characters are particularly likeable is not a biggie, if anything that's probably one of the few pluses about the book - no one gets out out of this book without a big shit stain writ large in their characterisation. Overall, lazy plotting (blackouts as plot device? please) with two dimensional characterisation and some very second-rate writing. "

I can't tell if the author did any research or interviewed a teen who knows every stereotype known to man.Plot:Once again shallow and within the first handful of pages I had the ending withing my grasp. Woo such mystery!Setting:Why even bother with the train? All it did was make more room for the hype to weasel itself in. It also allowed all the unrealistic people reviewing this book to say how clever it was.This is not something I would ever read again or recommend. This isn't even a true thriller or mystery book, it's just a typical murder case you can find in lots of places. Maybe had the author gave the characters something to build on and amplified the the mystery if would have gotten two stars from me."

There is a lot of hype over this book but I found it a disappointment. "
"1533",1532,"Katie Sholty","The blurb suggests a thrilling ride, much like Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window. Rachel rides a train. She sees the same houses and the same people living their lives as she passes them by on her commute. She gives these familiar faces names and lives. This is relatable concept. Who hasn't wandered about the strangers they see day to day, and to pass time create what we think to be their names, jobs, lives, etc. This is where the concept goes dry. Rachel is an alcoholic. A majority of the book is passed with Rachel in some state of inebriation. It's necessary for the plot, but it was hard to read through. In ways it drug the plot out longer than needed. We get it, you're an alcoholic, and the redundancy of it had me contemplating walking away.The story is told from the perspective of three women, Rachel, Megan, and Anna. What's clever about this, is that neither woman is a reliable narrator. The problem however is that at the basis of this story is that it is a mystery, yet the mystery isn't all that interesting. Each of these women have character flaws, yet the writing doesn't lend me to be sympathetic anyone's plight, instead I wanted the book to end and the death left a mystery."

Just another pedestrian tale of love and betrayal. I feel cheated!"
"1545",1544,"Michael Palkowski","This review contains spoilers. This was an impulse buy, I was drawn to the idea of the book before I had even heard of it. I started to wonder why this was and thought briefly about the role that trains typically play in literature, firstly as symbols, as props and often as ways of facilitating character tension and romance. Émile Zola for example, was one of the best writers to make use of trains in his work as a backdrop to intricate characters often embroiled in tense and turgid relationships. An example of this was his 1890 novel, ""La Bête humaine"", a psychological thriller set on the railway between Paris and Le Havre and there are overlaps at least on the surface, albeit ""The Girl on the Train"" ultimately lacks anything beyond the surface and so this was not a hard feat. This is a novel that is Gone Girl but without the psychological intelligence. The book has a flat narrative that is unjustified, particularly when it comes to spelling out and simplifying any ideas being developed. Nothing is left to the imagination. Mystery novels are meant to compel the reader and intrigue them into gathering mental clues as a way to try and solve an intricate puzzle but what happens here as a result of the narrative style is create an overwhelming dullness. The book has a one track mind, with the action being focused entirely on a singular objective with occasional flashbacks in-between, often rarely providing much content beyond the embryonic murder mystery. Further, this means that the book is spaced out and drags considerably longer than it deserves to run. The novel runs at 316 pages and over 100 pages could be cut without hampering the depth or identity of the story. The story style makes no sense, in presenting the narrative as diary sequences each with headings ""morning"" and ""evening"" and the date as a way to section out the action. Megan isn't a regular diary keeper, it is her therapist Dr Kamal who suggests it to her and we already have a number of entries from her by this point. There is a lack of overall imagination when considering basic description and so the same magpies are overheard doing the same things as before and we hear and see trains as omnipresent ghouls littering themselves through the novel in really unsophisticated ways. The repetition of the background could be deliberate but I suspect it was a lack of literary interest in developing a nuanced and believable world, or laziness. Is it describing Rachel's banal existence? I believe giving it this benefit of the doubt is being generous. Trains are everywhere but without significance. The train is mentioned so much that it could become its own character, but it has no meaning beyond what the characters pretend to give it. Other forms of detail in the novel dismantle the entire plot of the story due to their carelessness. One of these is when discussing Rachel's recovered memories. As explained within the book, during a blackout the brain does not actually create memories because long term memory is not functioning, memories are not stored and so cannot be retrieved, hence why it is called a blackout. Anything that is ""retrieved"" particularly by a therapist could be construed as an implanted memory, or a false memory. The book in mentioning hypnosis and these problems I have outlined, clearly show that the author thought mindfully of these issues but was so cynical of the readership that she decided to include them as a buffer, as opposed to an interesting plot development concerning the unreliable narrator struggling to deal with her own problems becoming part of a national story about a missing person. It could have been like the Hangover but for Stepford wives. Instead memories inexplicably fall into place, everything becomes clear. The sky is less misty now and everything is remembered and Rachel can become an unrealistic superhero. Rachel also inexplicably realizes that her dynamic with Tom is a lie but this happens without warning and it does not seem logical to assume that just by thinking really hard Rachel could recover memories that were not formulated and stored in the first place. What is extraordinary is the level of detail that can be ascertained by Rachel from simply looking out of the train window at the exact same stop every morning, although fanciful, we are never led to believe that there are different vantage points, or different perspectives. British trains are notorious for being late and for not arriving on time and although the motivation for her to construct a fantastical and flowery fantasy in Megan and Scott exists, the placing of these characters so conveniently to correspond to Rachel's travel itinerary just seems too unlikely. Characters are developed in cliche ridden ways and their motivations seem entirely implausible, one dimensional or simply convenient for the purposes of developing the plot in a radically different direction. Characters also exhibit considerable contradictions which prevent them developing as serious personalities. Further, the author's inability at maintaining consistency is not an example of emotionally frayed characters. Anna's actions are a clear example of a Deus ex machina, which this book is full of when it comes to the character's and their nonsensical motivations. I will provide examples of each. Firstly, let's look at Rachel. Rachel is an alcoholic and often experiences blackouts, so much that Rachel in describing her time with Tom, describes blackouts as a regular experience. Despite these debilitating and paralyzing traits that is hampering her life, she for the sake of appearances travels on the same train every morning to pretend to go to a job that she doesn't even have anymore. Does this sound like the sort of agency that someone with severe psychological trauma would do? Especially in saving face to someone like Cathy?, let's discuss her for a moment: Cathy is a mothering figure and her character is developed only to serve as a condemning, parental authority figure and her justification for having such concern for Rachel is never really explained, for she was described by Rachel as being simply someone she knew in College. There is no reason for her to be taking this role. Anna's motivations change considerably throughout the book and they especially make no rational sense by the ending page, the sociopathic distance she showed suddenly changes. Megan is painted in an unsympathetic light but her fluctuations with love are confused. She wants commitment and even is prepared to accept transference with her therapist. Her death is announced way too early in the book, it drops like a rock. The portrayal of the media is entirely misleading. Often a missing person case generates next to no interest, other than articles that make the inside pages of local newspapers that people in the area are aware of. We are to believe that before this woman was found dead, the media were running front page cover stories with intimate details drudging up the past in long profile pieces? That they would be outside the husbands house a mere four days after? The author worked in journalism for 15 years and she thinks this is how the media would react to a missing person story? The novel with all these faults peters out into a boring and empty psychological thriller that is blunt and lacking imagination. It should be avoided"

"1551",1550,"Doreen Fritz","Throughout the reading of this book, I felt the same icky aversion that stuck with me through much of *Gone Girl*. I can see why so many people have drawn comparisons between those two books - both are centered on hugely flawed characters, both deal with women who are just ""off"" - and both spring ""surprises"" on the readers. In fact, there was not a character in *Girl on the Train* that I liked or empathized with - even Cathy, the ever-tolerant and long-suffering roommate. What a pushover! Both men were controlling and almost psychotic. All three women were serial victims. They had a penchant for saying things like ""I know I shouldn't ....(whatever it is --- have another drink, go when a guy calls and asks to meet with them, or whatever)"", and then they'd go ahead and do that thing they knew they shouldn't have done. And disaster would follow. Very little to like in this book. Well, the cover was intriguing -- I liked the lettering of the title. It suggested the movement of the train. But that was about it."
"1552",1551,"Mirjam","stopped reading. did not like it at all."
"1553",1552,"Milhouse Houten","This is a great book!"
"1554",1553,"Deb Christensen","Same format as Gone Girl. Unfortunately I did not know before buying, or I would have not purchased this book."
"1555",1554,"Mindy","I really don't get it. This book functions only because one of the main characters makes the wrong decision every time she's faced with one, except until the very end where miraculously she makes reasonable decisions. It really seemed like someone saw the popularity of gone girl and thought, I could rip that off. This book is a hot lame sandwich and I'm having none of it."
"1556",1555,"Yanina","Less than average story and a really unsatisfying read."
"1559",1558,"Lindsay","I only got to the first 80 pages. Should I go on? I found it insanely boring, my nana said it's because a British wrote it and I'm used to novels written by Americans. Should I give it another shot?"
"1560",1559,"Terri","L'opinione che ho di questo libro conferma il fatto che i libri che hanno venduto milioni di copie non fanno per me. Dovrei starne alla larga come ho sempre fatto, almeno fino a quando termina tutto il clamore che gli si è creato intorno. La protagonista è di un patetico allucinante e non sono riuscita ad entrarci per nulla in sintonia. Anzi, non l'ho proprio sopportata nonostante abbia letto solo qualche capitolo. Ad un certo punto è svanito anche l'interesse per il ""mistero"", quella cosa sconvolgente che succede ad un certo punto della trama e che non accennava a palesarsi. Per quanto riguarda lo stile dell'autrice, stendiamo un velo pietoso. Non l'ho gradito per nulla."
"1561",1560,"Olga Colmenares","Siempre me llamó la atención este libro. Comencé a leerlo hace un par de días y debo admitir que trás un cuarto de libro leído lo abando. No me gusta dejar libros por la mitad siento que debería llegar hasta el final. Sin embargo, este ciclo es de cambios y la vida es muy corta para peder los pocos minutos de lectura que tengo en el día. Así adiós Rachel y Megan que otro lea su historia. no lo recomiendo a pesar de que está por todo lados."
"1562",1561,"Joyce","Not sure what the hype was all about this book. I did not find it all that thrilling. None of the characters were likeable. I felt I wasted a few hours of my time that I cannot get back."
"1563",1562,"Cindi O'connor","If you like a story line with only sordid characters, this book would be great. It actually moved along very well and was never boring. I just don’t like a depressing book where everyone is bad and nothing good happens."
"1564",1563,"Del","FYI: I am posting the same review on Amazon and Goodreads. Thank goodness I got this book from the library, if I had paid for it I would have been extremely angry. I've wanted to read this book since there have been so much hype since its release. For the life of me I cannot understand why so many people thought it is worth reading. The premiss seems promising- A woman on a train sees a couple who she seems to envy. During one of her train ride she witnesses something out of the ordinary. She then inserts herself in the solving of the crime. The mystery? Well, the story did not read like a mystery. It seems to me the story is a portrayal of every-day people living in misery and among them lives a sociopath who is loathsome. I cannot feel any sympathy for any of the characters, not even Rachel. She is a mess. Her drinking and loving a man who could care less about her makes me want to shake her...she seems like an adult having teenage angst. Scott is a brute, Megan never grew up, and Anne is selfish. I guessed ""who did it"" half way through the book (before t was revealed), not much suspense at all.This was a disappointing read. I would not recommend this book to anyone...well, if they are able to get it free then I guess that would be alright. "
"1566",1565,"Randi","Unoriginal, cliche, and depressing. I don't understand the hype at all!"
"1567",1566,"Judy Ball","Creepy, without a single character that I could care about."
"1568",1567,"Melinda","This is a book that I heard was being made into a movie at some time in 2016 so I decided to give it a try. Started reading it, got bored, lost interest and realized it was not my genre of literature real quick and decided to put it down. Fortunately that was a good decision as my niece did finish it and did not give it a thumbs up either but was able to tell me the outcome of the story which I was disinterested in anyway. Boo."
"1570",1569,"Robin Garcia","Didn't finish this, just could not get into it."
"1571",1570,"Constance Lepro","A tedious mess. "
"1575",1574,"Jay","Awful. All the characters were the same, the writing was not sophisticated. In fairness, I could not finish the book. Maybe it got better."
"1576",1575,"J.l.rodriguez","Rachel es el personaje más patético de toda la literatura. Clavado a Perdida.Misterio planísimo. Personajes penosos.Lo único bueno la escritura pero que vamos que ni por eso se salva este libro."
"1577",1576,"Viktoriya","This book was boring. I honestly don't understand why it is so popular. It was very hard to find even one character that I could actually care about. And having three different narrators felt like I had multiple personalities. "
"1578",1577,"Kaui","For those who like Gillian Flynn, I highly recommend this book. For those looking for redeemable characters, sympathetic even in the slightest vein, and for complete, grammatically correct sentences, this book is not for you. For those accustomed to complex characters, complex dialogue and mellifluous language, do not even think about picking this one up. I think this book started out in a melancholy way, sunk to depression and by the end, even with the fun twist, the book found its way to a place even lower than depression. I think, though, this would make a good thriller movie."
"1579",1578,"Jill","This is a psychological thriller. What does that mean? A book full of people's thoughts and conversation make up the story. My discovery about my reading tastes with this book is, I do not care at all for this type of writing. A bunch of dysfunctional personalities does not edify anyone. "
"1581",1580,"Rachna","The book starts off incredibly slow and just stays slow. Not much happens and the plot just trudges along. I kept reading due to the hype, and the book never quite lives up to it. The characters are compelling, which is why I came back to it and finished it. It certainly was not the plot that kept me engaged. I figured out the ""twist"" halfway through the book so the book never quite lived up to it's psychological thriller promise for me. Parts of the novel remind me of before i go to sleep by sj watson. As a character study, the book is somewhat interesting enough to hold your attention, but beyond that it felt like a colossal waste of time. "
"1582",1581,"Joni Graybill","Man, this was a terrible book. To coin a phrase, ""What a depressing bunch of freaks.""I'm loathe to give a book one star. Novels are a creative outpouring just like any other art form and should rarely just be dismissed. I can usually find something I like, something to recommend it, or at the very least I realize that it isn't a bad book, I'm just not the intended audience. This is a rubbish $5 mass market paperback that you buy off an airport spinner and take on holiday masquerading as glossy Book Club bait. This wants to be ""Gone Girl"" or, maybe more accurately, Agatha Christie so badly that I'm kind of embarrassed for it.I'm hard pressed to think of three less compelling first-person narrators than this trio of pathetic women - a raging alcoholic (did you know Rachael drinks? Like, a lot? No? That's okay because they book will remind you a further 4700 times before you're finished reading), a slutty home wrecker and... whatever the hell exactly Megan was. Not that the men were any better - 2 for 2 on the abusive dick front. Nice.I also figured out who the killer was well before the unreliable narrative thought I should and that never helps a book like this. A big twist might have saved it somewhat... but, alas.Also, Rachael drinks. All the time. In case that was unclear."
"1583",1582,"Brittany","This didn't even come close to living up to all the hype."
"1585",1584,"Jen Sainty","This. Book. Was. TerribleI give it 0.5/5None of the characters were particularly likeable. I think this author tried so hard to make them human that she exaggerated all their flaws, giving them nothing to redeem them in the eyes of the reasonable man. (view spoiler)[Rachel is a pathetic, alcoholic mess who suffers from frequent blackouts. Megan is a raging nympho. Anna is weak and mentally warped. Scott is possessive and clingy, and last but not least Tom is a sociopath.  (hide spoiler)]The plot takes incredibly long to pick up, and even then, only after first highlighting for 100 plus pages just how depressing Rachel's sad life is, amidst the booze, tears, hysterical calls, frequent blackouts and the odd pool of vomit and blood here and there.  The police are manifestly unhelpful throughout, and the entire thing rolls towards a predictable, unexciting end. "
"1587",1586,"Maura","Don't get the hype at all on this one. Just got worse and worse as I read on. Simple, thin, silly. "
"1588",1587,"Donna Webber","Kind of creepy and a bit contrived. But I didn't really like Gone Girl, and this was a poor man's Gone Girl."
"1590",1589,"Zoe","Absolute rubbish. Characters are truly pathetic and annoying without even one redeeming feature between them. "
"1591",1590,"Michael Rebibo","I wish a train hit all the characters in this book and ended it after 5 pages. "
"1592",1591,"Alexander Mesa","No entiendo como este libro puede ser un best-seller, la verdad es que es monótono desde el principio, muy aburrido. Nunca logré conectarme con él.Lectura abandonada."
"1593",1592,"Susan Tauster","This is a best seller....why?? A bunch of shallow, whack-a-doodle characters. When the narrative shifts, the voice/person telling the story never changes. I considered putting it down, but it's been so long since I read a truly awful book that I decided to stick with it to corroborate my initial assessment. Why this book gets good reviews is beyond me. "
"1594",1593,"Paula","Terrible. Predictable. Waste of time. No wonder it took so long to read. This book dragged on and on and on and to my surprise, and so many rave reviews, nothing good came of it. I can't believe people compare this to Gone Girl. Now THAT'S a story!"
"1595",1594,"Crystal Gao","I am quite disappointed. Don't understand what the fuzz is all about. This is not in the same league of Gone Girl. I don't connect with any of the characters at all. The book does such stereotypical portrait of women that I find it offensive. The women were mean, needy, weak and selfish. The only good trait seems to be the maternal instincts (not all of them has it). The writing is poor, repetitive. Too much monologue that does not build the plot but rather just emotions and ranting. Remind me of Fifty shades of Grey - don't get it and not for me."
"1596",1595,"Jule","Ehrlich gesagt habe ich mich noch nie so durch ein Buch gequält wie bei diesem. Ich fand Rachel, die Protagonistin, wirklich furchtbar. Auch die anderen Charaktere waren mir nicht sympatisch. Das bisschen Spannung was sich gegen Ende des Buches aufbaut war schon ganz in Ordnung, allerdings fand ich, dass das Ende viel zu schnell von statten ging. Ich saß auf der Couch und war ganz verdattert, dass das Buch schon vorbei ist. Irgendwie war ich aber auch froh, dass ich es endlich beendet hatte. Zwischendrin wollte ich mehrmals abbrechen, aber da ich es von meinem eigenen Geld gekauft hatte, wollte ich es nun auch zu Ende lesen. Wäre es ein Buch aus der Bibliothek, dann hätte ich es sicherlich nach den ersten 50 Seiten sofort zurück gebracht. "
"1598",1597,"Erin Davidson","I had a hard time continuing with the book because the struggle the main character deals with is not one I relate to nor feel sorry for. "
"1599",1598,"Paola Ozuna","Long, boring, superficial and predictable. "
"1600",1599,"Dodey","They sure had a good marketing department on this one - after all the hype I was pretty disappointed. It was like reading a bunch of journals from high school girls, none of whom I'd like to get to know better. All the characters so unlikeable that I was almost rooting for the bad things that happen to them. Not even close to hitchcock, or even a good soap opera for that matter."
"1601",1600,"Maribel","This book has no redeeming qualities. It's predictable in scope, in language & unfortunately as representative of female stereotypes. Every single female character is weak, hysterical, irrational, and depressing. I just wanted at least one character to own their infidelity and relationship. Instead they were all pathetic. Sad review for a female author. The further I read the more annoying it became. I honestly can't believe this is publishable."
"1602",1601,"Laura Barnes-laevens","Hated it! Hated everyone it in it. Not one redeeming quality in any of the characters. Very slow. "
"1603",1602,"Graciela Cornejo","Este mes quise leer un thriller psicológico, y aunque este libro no es un ejemplo de él(para mi no tienen nada de thriller psicológico),lo comencé a leer porque es el ultimo libro, del que todos hablan y quise ver que tal era. Siempre pensé que era mala para adivinar sucesos o teorías, pero o era mentira o el libro era MUUUUUUUUUUUUY predecible, lo que mas lamento era adivinar al asesino en la pagina 30 de casi 400 paginas, por lo general los personajes principales son un asco(en teoría casi todos) pero se rescata mucho a los personajes secundarios, este libro no tenía ni siquiera eso... por mi podían haber matado a todos y a mi seguiría dándome igual.Y ni que decir el ritmo del libro, era TAAAAAAAAAAN lento, que hacia que lo dejara en varios momentos."
"1604",1603,"Alex Odesho","I didn't like it. It didn't change the way I look at people's lives. It was so PREDICTABLE. I didn't like the writing style at all. The characters and their development (if there is one) is so poor. And it's kind of slow. "
"1608",1607,"Rosalie Davis","Did not care for this book. Non-admirable characters, and topic."
"1609",1608,"Mgk","Could not finish, rambling."
"1610",1609,"Heather Allen","Excruciatingly terrible. "
"1613",1612,"Bhumika Ladhani","It was just another 'doesn't make a difference' kind of book...read it only if you have absolutely nothing better to do...its a simple, predictable book that doesn't require application of brain cells...Though the writer has mulled in detail over the mundane details of its characters, there is no depth, no complexity...just nothing...it all falls flat...Story line is predictable, the main character is boring/depressing/retarded (maybe?)...Could have been An amazing plot but the angles supposed to make this a thriller like the man with red hair, the dead lady killed her kid etc seem out of the place and don't add anything to the story...wouldn't recommend the book to anyone..."
"1618",1617,"Joleen Bell","A complete waste of time!!!! So cliche!!!! I grew tired of her character and stupid obsession on a particular couple. "
"1619",1618,"Lily","I thought I should read it just because everyone read it and I was avoiding other things at the time. I kept on until the end because I like endings and wanted to know what happened, even though I hated it. The characters are so dislikeable I actually wanted something terrible to happen to them. (I'm looking at you Anna.) Yes, you can say that's what makes it interesting, that it's a character study or that it shows how we deal with misconceptions, but really it's just frustrating to listen to Rachel talk about drinking all the time or be convinced of opinions she has no proof of. I wish I hadn't been pulled in by the hype. "
"1621",1620,"Sarahjae","I rarely put a book down without finishing it. In this case, I couldn't bear another paragraph. "
"1623",1622,"Kristi R","Halfway through it, and it's so predictable. The characters are so messed up, you know exactly what will happen. The cheaters cheat, the liars lie, the drinkers drink, and the innocent are innocent. There's nothing inspiring about any of the characters or their story lines. May or may not finish it, depends on how much trouble I have falling asleep. "
"1625",1624,"Sam73","Ging wel.... dreach boek. Einde wel leuk"
"1626",1625,"Kim Myers","I had a very difficult time with this book. I thought the characters were rather shallow and not well developed. Their issues were repeated and did not hold my interest. For the life of me, I cannot understand why this book achieved the interest that it did. If I had not wanted to find out the ""who done it"", I would not have finished the book. In the end I felt I wasted time reading this book."
"1627",1626,"Flora","The book was a fast-read, mainly driven by my desire to just be done with it. Right from the beginning, the characters do nothing to endear themselves to the reader. There is nothing redeeming about any of the characters and even worst, the novel is so incredibly sexist. While the teaser promises a novel full of intrigue, it falls flat on its delivery. There is no overt distinction between the characters nor does the storyline allow for character development. The ending leaves you with a sense of distaste and the compulsion to merely sweep the book under the bed. While it may be gripping at moments, and oh those moments are so fleeting, overall the novel is quite disappointing given the hype that surrounds it. "
"1629",1628,"Deni","What a disappointment. Started out strong and ended incredibly weak and trite."
"1630",1629,"Neil","""As I surfaced to wakefulness.""Well, this was an awful mistake. It was an impromptu audiobook purchase, then I was stuck with it. I knew nothing about it but from seeing its prominent position in bookshops etc, had formed the impression that it would be fun and ingenious and stuff. Stupidly, I didn't read the tag-line, which would have (correctly) put me off.It's about horrible people doing stupid nasty things. Plus the writing does not come across well being read aloud.Abandoned half-way through."
"1633",1632,"Jillian","I truly disliked this book. The characters were flat, predictable, and uninteresting. Much of the plot either did not make sense or was just boring. If the book were any longer I would probably not have finished it, but because it was so short I decided to trudge through to the end."
"1634",1633,"Ardilla Bgs Andika","forbidden to read this book while drinking red wine together with your secret boy/girlfriend! I didn't care about any of them. None of the characters were likeable!!"
"1635",1634,"Ann","People are sick. Those who write books and the people they write about."
"1636",1635,"Shalyce","I'm not sure if I've ever read a book with a more sad, pathetic and uninspiring cast of characters. Not a single character in the book was given any redeeming qualities-maybe because the author wanted you to think that all of them could be sleazy enough to do something horrible. (view spoiler)[ It also didn't feel realistic to me that Rachel could be that clueless to what life was like with her ex--that he could totally just recreate situations for her.(view spoiler)[Honestly, I should have just stopped reading it in the beginning-too much language and sex for my taste. It was just an icky book all the way around. I can't believe it was chosen for a Goodreads Choice Award. Disappointing. (hide spoiler)] (hide spoiler)]"
"1637",1636,"Vicki Elia","A circuitous story crippled by poor narration. Uninteresting and unreadable in audio."
"1638",1637,"Karen Van esch","this book quickly went from a 5 to a 4 to a 3 to a 2 to finally a 1. the book had me for so long. I loved the way the story was going. I literally could not put it down. as the mystery started to reveal clues it just went no where. anticlimactic answers through and through. also what do the clothes have to do with anything! expected so much more out of the top book of the year"
"1639",1638,"Christy Johnson","Terrible"
"1640",1639,"Andy Stone","Last week, I was stuck at the airport with a brutal layover. Bought this book to pass the time. Even at 90 and 95 percent complete, I felt that I could've just put it down at any point. All of the characters sounded exactly the same, the plot was predictable, and the dialogue was a paint-by-numbers affair. "
"1641",1640,"Hayley","Hello, someone else who didn't get the hype around this book - nothing actually HAPPENS until the last 50 pages or so and to be honest, the build up was hardly page-turning. I read this on my lunch breaks, so I only ever read for about 20-30min stretches and that was enough! Until the end where I was just so frustrated with the book going no-where I read the last third in one weekend afternoon just to see if it was ever going to end. It did, thank god. "
"1643",1642,"Becca West","I actually didn't finish it but there isn't a bookshelf for that."
"1644",1643,"Hope","This book is no where comparable to gone girl. I did not enjoy it at all "
"1645",1644,"Melissa Namba","Ugh, so I really should have mot expected much of this book given that it was called the next ""Gone Girl"", which I also hated. But I had high hopes thinking that being on the New York Times bestseller list would not allow it to be a crappy book. I was wrong. This book sucked. I didn't care for or about any of the characters. There was nothing interesting or relateable about any of them. Periphera characters who should have been better developed (i.e. the cops involved), were only sketchily described. I felt no empathy at all for any of the characters. Who cares is Rachel is a battered wife and an alcoholic? Or that Megan is also a battered wife? Or that pretty much everyone in this book cheats on his or her spouse. Bleh."
"1646",1645,"Becky","Read it because it was on a ""must read"" list. Mistake. Depressing!"
"1647",1646,"Kerrie","For me, one of the main characters was to childish and there was far too much profanity. Authors should have enough knowledge of the English language to be able to write effectively without having to lower the material into the slums. "
"1650",1649,"Zara Gooding","what the hell did I just read. hmmm let me think oh yeah misery in a bookthis book was so bad that I just couldn't bear to finish it. I honestly don't think I have ever been so depressed reading a book but the main characters were so mind numbing all the time. I just didn't care what happened to them at all. Rachel is a drunk who literally has no control over her life and basically lives her life in fantasy land whether its pretending to go to work or imagining make believe lives for people in the houses she passes.jess just seems as bad as rachel giving up on everythingI have no problem reading novels with people who have mental illnesses and problems but it just seemed like there was no reprieve to the misery. It is well written I suppose, the language is good but the characters just drain the story. I found myself putting the book down more and more and only picking it up when I was unhappy because this novel just has the ability to pull down even a happy person. "
"1651",1650,"Gernell","Terrible. Across the board terrible. Unlikable and unredeeming characters. Boring ""mystery"". Don't waste your time. "
"1652",1651,"Judy  LeClerc","Weird, depressing book.This was a real mistake to spend money on. Awful story about alcoholism, a disturbed mind and raving jealousy. And it just goes on and on with no let up in the misery and depression. "
"1653",1652,"Marcus","I don't think I've ever given one star to a book. Usually, I don't finish books this bad (and I don't rate book I don't finish), but this was an audiobook, so for lack of something else to listen to in my commute I made it all the way through. Someone recommended this book to me as the next ""Gone Girl"". This is definitely not the next ""Gone Girl"". You slowly but surely grow to loathe the main characters (pretty much all of them), and not in a good way. They are not a villains, just people you loathe.* minor spoiler follows *The book is based on the ""unreliable witness"" technique. Can you believe what the each character is saying and even thinking? Okay, it's a plot device, and it can work, but it has to work within the context of the story. Someone who is tortured might have altered memories or be convinced that they've seen things they haven't. But a first person narrated story that has the each character directly lie to the reader is just plain stupid. The only reason I can think of is that the author had no other way of generating suspense. Because if the main character told the truth, then you would put the book down right away. At the end little is provided except maybe the insight that the whole of humanity is shallow, somewhat depraved, lonely and really not worth caring about. Maybe in that sense the book is a success, it too well reflects a large part of our world. But it isn't an amazing insight, and frankly I just felt empty after reading it. I do give huge kudos to the actual narrators of the audiobook. Besides their voices, I loved having each chapter read by the main character narrating it. The switching of voices between chapters was fantastic and I wish other audiobooks would follow suit. It's probably more expensive, but I wouldn't have made the 11 hour journey without them. "
"1654",1653,"Chelian Sundaram","The Girl on the train was strictly average. Looks like Gone girl has inspired a lot of writers to try out more of that kind. Definitely I wouldn't recommend to people who likes to spend time with quality books"
"1656",1655,"Sydney W","This book is about a women who rides the train everyday, while observing a nearby women who lives in the houses below. She connects somehow to the women, and that's what this book is solving. I didn't like this book at all. It was very boring and very confusing as it transitioned between characters. This book could be very good to some others, but as for my taste, I don't really like it."
"1657",1656,"Greg","Really dragged for me. Sorry"
"1658",1657,"Bengisu","I have no idea why there are so many 5 star ratings. The book was written so amateurish. The ending was so obvious. It was so predictable. Author of the book should at least try and come up with a less obvious ending. This book literally waste of my time. I have no idea why this book is a bestseller. There are so much incredible books out there. Please develop your imagination and don't suprise with this obvious endings."
"1659",1658,"Gloria","Disappointing."
"1661",1660,"Amy Edwards","I checked this book out from the library, and my parting words to the librarian were, ""If it's as good as people say, I guess I'll be bringing it back soon."" She wrinkled her nose a bit and said, ""Well, I didn't like it actually, but you may."" I ended up agreeing with the librarian. I read the first third and skimmed to the end, not really wanting to give it my time. This books is what it says, I suppose: a psychological thriller. I guess I have learned I am not a fan of that genre. "
"1662",1661,"Gustavo Morles","Avoid if you are a man!Not a murder mystery. Not a psychological thriller. It' like sitting with your girlfriend telling you how she feels, to then sit with your mother, and then your female coworker. They just want to talk about feelings. Not even close to Gone Girl"
"1664",1663,"Julia","I had high hopes going into this book. The numerous 5 star ratings were somewhat promising. I adore psychological thrillers; but this was horrible.All three women, were in my opinion, the same person with a different name. I had to keep referring back to the beginning of each chapter to figure out who I was reading. There was nothing distinguishing between them. After the first few chapters I stopped caring. I didn't care about the mystery, or the 'twist' which was incredibly foreseeable.One of the best reviews I saw for this book, the reviewer said ""This is a book for people who don't read. This book is only so highly rated because people who read one book a year are picking it up for a flight or a vacation, etc. I don't like you people. You do stupid things like rave about 50 Shades of Grey and get terrible novels turned into movies."" AMEN.I need to stop now. My hate for this book will cause me to keep typing and quite frankly the book doesn't even deserve it."
"1667",1666,"Flavia Barros","I'm very disappointed. It's a book about the 3 weakest most boring and annoying women ever. "
"1668",1667,"Trisha","This was awful. The writing was ok but the story and supposed plot twists were predictable and the characters were all hateful. This was basically a story about pathetic women. I have no idea what so many people see in this book."

"1670",1669,"Kate Barone","Sad & slow moving from start to finish. I wanted to jump off the train too many times."
"1671",1670,"Steffi","Caution. There might be some ranting ahead.This has frequently been called the next Gone Girl. And yes, that is to some extend why I wanted to read this. I wanted something suspenseful; an unreliable narrator; and lots of “what the hell?!”- moments. Out of these three things I got one – an unreliable narrator. But one written so clumsily and shallow that I was annoyed, not intrigued, by her. The plot’s mystery falls flat because it is done in such a heavy-handed way. The shift between narrative points of view and the two timelines seem like an artificial way of keeping the reader in the dark. The alcohol-induced blackouts of the main character just add to that feeling. I constantly thought “oh, how convenient that she does not remember that” and “oh, how convenient she can recall a tiny detail now”. It was simply clumsy and trite. However, the worst thing about Rachel, the protagonist and main narrator, weren’t the clichés about alcoholism and divorced women. These aspects annoyed me to no end but the absolute worst thing about Rachel and the two other female narrators was how pathetic they were. Throughout the book I got the feeling that Paula Hawkins must hate women; hate them with a passion. Women in this novel are portrayed as unstable (going on batshit crazy), weak, dependent (on men), and insecure. Every single woman mentioned defines her personality in relation to a man. They doubt themselves, their capabilities and decisions. The men, in contrast, are all mysterious but strong and sure of themselves. They are there to give definition and meaning to their wives, girlfriends, mistresses, and sons. Even those women on the side-lines of the plot are only defined by their relationships to men.For instance, Rachel’s mother; she is only mentioned two or three times and the one time she actually gets a few lines is when she explains how she’s not able to help her daughter at the moment because she has a new “friend” and she doesn’t want to scare him off like that! Seriously? Also, Rachel’s roommate is supposed to be the one thinking clearly; she tries to keep Rachel sober and wants her to go to AA meetings, get a grip on life, and so on. Still, even the supposedly reasonable character is defined by her boyfriend. When she’s not home she is with him and when he is out of town for some reason she sits at home waiting for him. And these are only the minor female characters in this novel.Rachel, Anna, and Megan are all pathetic in their very own way. They pine about the men that leave or reject them; they doubt their life decisions and still won’t change anything in order not to upset their men. And every single thought they have is about how their decisions or actions might affect their husbands, ex-husbands, boyfriends, or lovers. I know I’m ranting a bit here, but this really really annoyed me. I also know what Hawkins was trying to do. She wanted to show the dark side of domestic life – just like Gone Girl did. But in my opinion she has utterly failed to do so."
"1672",1671,"Crystal Smith","Being totally honest here, I waited over a month to get this book from the library and ended up being disappointed after the first chapter. And for some it may seem like I didn't give it a fair chance and that one chapter isn't enough to tell how the rest of the book will go but unfortunately I had it mostly figured out after the first couple of pages.The story itself is basically a rehashing (and a really bad one at that) of Hitchcock's Rear Window. Jimmy Stewart's character in the movie is mentally unstable and claims to have seen a murder in the apartment across the street, compare to a girl with a drinking problem (who logically in this case could be mentally impaired by the wine) thinks she sees a murder on the train. It was underwhelming and very predictable and such a huge letdown after hearing all the praise about it. I'm all for using old ideas for new inspiration but this one was a bit on the nose. My solution? Don't read this, go watch the Hitchcock movie it's way better and stars Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly (win-win!)"
"1673",1672,"Morag","Tedious with self centered characters who constantly make bad decisions and never learn from their mistakes. Should have quit reading after about 20 pages but kept slogging through thinking it would get better. Don't waste your time. "
"1674",1673,"Ronda Palsulich","This book reminded me of the premise in Gone Girl. None of the characters were at all endearing and they were all quite flawed. I didn't feel like there was much of a take away from this book. I found the whole thing to be depressing and a waste of my time."

"1676",1675,"Marcia","I am being GENEROUS giving this book 1 star. I feel I completely wasted my time on this book. The entire story was of an alcoholic. So if on every.single.page. it doesn't bother you to read about this chick getting so drunk she pees or poops herself, throws up, does dumb things then doesn't remember them then go for it. This book is for you. That would be 303 pages of this. Then you get to the bottom of the murder. Note the end of the book is page 323. Don't waste your time."
"1677",1676,"Lavada","I failed to follow my rule of not wasting time on a book if it didn't grab me by page 49. Why, oh why did I keep going? It was dull and tedious and I didn't like any of the characters even a little bit. "
"1678",1677,"Ashlee","Really?? Choice of the year?? Four stars?? Ugh. This book was terrible. In fact, I never finished it. However, I am confident in my analysis even without knowing how it ended. The characters were awful. It was a wanna-be book. It wanted to be dramatic and engrossing when it really was just maudlin and overplayed. Not worth the time I spent on it."
"1679",1678,"Hannah Falangie","A big fuss over nothing particularly special. I struggled through this book because I found it so slow and the characters were so difficult to tolerate. So basically to story bounces between three women, all unemployed, all having painfully boring and empty lives and all involved with the same man at one point. I hated every single character, there was nothing remotely interesting in any of them and made the book almost impossible to finish. And for some reason a red-haired guy was mentioned on several occasions and had absolutely nothing to do with the plot whatsoever? Although I was presently surprised at how I was unable to guess the 'killer' by the end of the novel, I still found it painfully boring to read and saturated with underdeveloped and uninteresting characters. "
"1680",1679,"Karine","Alle sammenligner denne med Gone Girl (norsk: Flink Pike) av Gillian Flynn. Så jeg antar jeg ubevisst gjorde det samme. Og da må det sies at the Girl om the Train hadde litt å leve opp til, for jeg digget Gone Girl.Så det var kanskje ikke det beste utgangspunktet.Men. Det unnskylder ikke denne boka.Den begynte greit, det gjorde den. Problemet er at fortellingen ikke kom seg videre. Det skjedde ingenting. Jeg leste en anmeldelse som spurte seg om thrillere er ensbetydende med ingen personutvikling. Jeg tenker at en PSYKOLOGISK thriller i alle fall kunne hatt godt av at personene utvikler seg litt. Det blir rimelig irriterende etter hvert å lese om en alkoholikers refleksjoner rundt at ""jeg burde ikke drikke"", ""jeg burde ikke ringe"", ""jeg burde ikke..."". Og så gjøre de samme tingene igjen og igjen. Og igjen.På en måte er the Girl on the Train bygget opp litt likt Gone Girl. Skiftende synsvinkel; den enes historie starter et år før nåtid og arbeider seg nærmere. Jeg tenkte det kanskje ville ta seg opp ved at den ene historien tok igjen den andre. Men det skjedde ikke. Så jeg fortsatte å vente. På et vendepunkt, en twist, at historien skulle ta seg opp. Det var vel et forsøk på et vendepunkt kanskje da det var 50-60 sider igjen av boka. 260 sider med flat spenningskurve og en rotete hovedperson. Og når løsningen endelig demrer for de involverte, har hintene vært umulige å misforstå en stund allerede, og det hele blir en forutsigbar klisjé. De sier ""likte du Gone Girl vil du elske denne."" Har du lest Gone Girl, vil denne skuffe deg.Har du ikke lest Gone Girl: les den istedenfor."

That's the kind of praise that must be used sparingly, not squandered on something as thinly-plotted and tedious as ""The Girl on the Train."" Here's the story, what there is of one, but SPOILER ALERT: a black-out drunk who witnessed a murder remembers vague and useless details at an excruciatingly slow pace, until the end, when it all conveniently comes back in a rush and she solves the murder and the killer makes the obligatory long-winded confession right before he gets what's coming to him.

"1711",1710,"Yuli Pritania","Dari dulu sudah belajar untuk mencurigai novel-novel yang mampangin puluhan endorsement. Kenapa? Karena sebuah buku yang bagus nggak butuh bantuan pujian dari banyak orang untuk disukai. Itu seolah penerbitnya nggak yakin bukunya bakal dilirik, jadi harus mamerin sederet nama orang terkenal yang muji-muji buku mereka.Reviu-reviu mereka mencoba meyakinkan saya bahwa novel ini adalah novel yang luar biasa genius, mengerikan, membuat gemetar, penuh twist yang mencengangkan, dan akhir yang tak disangka-sangka. Saya tersendat-sendat pada paruh pertama. Dan saat saya menyadari bahwa ada tiga narator di dalamnya, tiga perempuan 'sakit jiwa', saya langsung tahu bahwa narasi-narasi dari mereka hanya untuk menyesatkan saja. Bahkan saya langsung punya dua tersangka utama, Scott dan Tom, saat Rachel dideskripsikan kehilangan momen-momen selama beberapa menit atau beberapa jam setiap kali dia mabuk. Ya, saya tidak mencurigai Kamal sama sekali. Dan langsung mencoret nama Scott dari daftar ketika melihat betapa tidak stabilnya dia secara emosional. Seorang pembunuh berdarah dingin selalu terlihat tenang, terlihat seperti orang biasa yang tidak perlu diperhatikan. Hanya latar belakang. Karena itu sedari awal Tom sudah menarik minat saya.Bagi orang-orang yang lagi galau, disarankan tidak membaca novel ini. Novel ini begitu membuat depresi, tiga orang narator dan tidak ada satu pun dari mereka yang tidak frustrasi dan mengalami gangguan mental. Membacanya membuat saya lelah, tapi saya bertahan hingga akhir karena penasaran bagaimana si penulis mengemasnya dengan cara 'luar biasa' seperti yang semua orang banggakan. Saya berakhir kecewa.Novel ini luar biasa 'sangat biasa' untuk ukuran sebuah novel thriller. Saya mengharapkan sesuatu yang menegangkan dan tidak ada satu adegan pun dalam buku ini yang membuat saya merasakannya. Saya sudah membaca ratusan novel thriller dan ini adalah salah satu novel paling tidak mengerikan yang pernah saya baca. Ini lebih cocok disebut novel psikologis mungkin, karena tokoh-tokohnya bisa membuat para pembaca ikut putus asa bersama mereka. Alasan pembunuhan terjadi sangat klise, cara membunuh pun tidak istimewa. Pembaca hanya diseret ke sana kemari demi membuat novel ini tembus 400 halaman.*Lagi-lagi tertipu reviu orang.

"1715",1714,"Ginney Etherton","I don't understand how tedious books like this get on ""best-sellers"" lists.

Anna has an affair with Rachel's husband and ends up marrying him and having a child. She finds satisfaction in being the woman who a husband is willing to leave his wife for.

I know many people love this book, I'm just not in to such a depressing story. The only redeeming quality was that it had a better ending than expected. The person who recommended this book paired the recommendation with Gone Girl...I don't think I'm going there. Maybe I'll watch the movie, so much easier to stop in the middle of a movie then in the middle of a book."

"1746",1745,"Milaarquen","I don't know how to rate this book. I feel that I truly hated it for so many reasons, but they're more personal reasons than for the way it's written... More or less...To be fair, I really think it's too long. She kept describing and explaining the same emotions over and over and over again and that was boring. I hope she works on this topic for her next book and insert new elements or emotions or anything interesting if she wants to make it longer.Besides being repetitive, it became pretty obvious when she gave more clues about what happened. Ah! And the characters don't grow or change or get better... Is just the same thing over and over... So, no development of ANY character, the same plain thing all the time.She tells the story from 3 points of views , describing the facts between past and present.I heard some people comparing it with Gone Girl and it's an unfair thing to do. Gone Girl is electric, dynamic and thrilling, you can see the characters transformations and the plot twists blown you mind! With The Girl on the Train, you keep reading to know the end, but you don't get hooked in a good way. You just want to get to the end and get rid of those people.Now I can't continue without any spoilers, so stop reading right now if you don't want any!...................................................................... I don't believe anyone will empathize with any of those characters given some chapters. All women are weak-minded, easily manipulated, clinging to abusive relationships, with a hell of low self-esteem. It's outrageous. Not one single strong woman.At the beginning, you pity Rachel and feel really sorry for all her troubles. In the end, you get annoyed about all she's done, the situations that she put herself into and that last act didn't show any transformation of her growing or getting out of her messy state of mind. Anna... You start disliking her and by the end you really hate her. She is a bitch and keeps being one until the end. Megan, she sounds really depressed and maybe was the only one that I pitied until the end. She showed progress, changing, improving... And then she was dead. So, the only character that appeared to get just a little bit better died.Even police office Riley is an asshole. She mistreats people for no reason. I was hoping that a reason would be explained, more of her character displayed, but not... Just a bitch.Cathy, the super-fake-nice-person that lives for her boyfriend is another one that doesn't change or shows more. She's just there to be that one criticizing without connecting even with the reader.Even Rachel's mother is a useless character that forgets about what the daughter is going thru to talk about her ""new friend"". Wth?!Then you get to the men of this story... Holly shit...They are ALL abusive. Scott is an aggressive short-tempered and self-centered man, very disrespectful with women.Kamal takes advantage over a fragile and damaged patient and just try to put the ""mistake"" away.Tom is a bastard cheater that abuses women mentally and physically.Megan's ex-boyfriend, another asshole who leaves when things get hard.Even the red-haired dude leaves Rachel by herself when she is visibly not good.So you have weak, damaged and abused women versus violent, abusive and selfish men in a story the grows over their sick relationships. I hope Paula Hawkins uses her talent to do something, at least, a little more constructive next time. Not that I'm willing to read another of her books...Now, if you want to save time I'll summarize it for you:(Stop here if you REALLY don't want any spoilers)................A couple wants to have a baby. Wife (R) can't have a baby and becomes a drunk. Husband (T) abuses her mentally and physically and get a divorce to marry his mistress (A) whom is pregnant.After 2 years R still clingy to T, crying for love and being rejected over and over (and not just T, but every single character despises her). Meanwhile T have an affair with a neighbor (M) who is married to another self centered guy (S) and is fucked buy her therapist (K).M gets pregnant, tells T. T kills M. Everybody points to K and S. R and A discover about the killing and kill T in self defense.The end.You can summarize the characters into one woman and one man, since they all seamed to be singular shades of the same person.The woman: depressed, abused, desperate for love, paranoid that thinks that life is all about to have a relationship.The man: selfish, lier, aggressive, abusive, manipulative, short tempered and doesn't give a shit to anyone besides himself.Yep, that's how ""good"" it is.Do yourself a favor and go read another book."
"1747",1746,"Anastasia","I wish I could give this zero stars. This was the most difficult book I have read in a long time. It was slow from the beginning and took well over 100 pages to actually have something worth reading happen. The characters were all unlikeable, had no depth, and were all selfish, twisted people. I honestly have no idea what the hype is. I forced myself to finish this and I will never make that mistake again. The fact that this is actually becoming a movie baffles me even more. "

I was glad to be done with it. I saw another reviewer compare it to Gone Girl. It reminded me of that book also, although she gave this a positive review. I did think the author did an authentic job describing alcoholism and its destruction but thought Rachel's blackouts as a vehicle for suspense fell short. "
"1757",1756,"Kristina","On the cover of the book that I read is this quote from Tess Gerritsen: “So thrilling and tense and wildly unpredictable, it sucked up my entire afternoon. Not to be missed.” Tess, if you think this book is “wildly unpredictable” then I should maybe stop reading your books. Absolutely nothing is unpredictable about this book. It’s a melodramatic, histrionic story that gets increasingly tedious and ridiculous until you want to throw all the damn characters in front of the train. Not one of them is worthwhile. I didn’t relate to any of them and I didn’t care about them. The women are particularly despicable. Rachel used to be married to Tom. They used to live in number 23 Blenheim Road. But then she got depressed because she couldn’t have a baby, she began drinking a lot, and Tom had an affair with Anna. Now Rachel is divorced, sharing a flat with a woman she barely knows, and drinking cans of pre-mixed gin and tonic while riding the 8:04 train to Euston station in London. She’s going to a job she was fired from just to keep up the pretense of having a job. Also, this train happens to pass behind Blenheim Road and Rachel can see Tom with his new wife Anna and their child living in number 23. She doesn’t like seeing this. She does like seeing the occupants of number 15 Blenheim Road. They look like the perfect couple—he’s so handsome, she’s so pretty. Rachel names them Jason and Jess and fantasizes about their perfect life. One day when riding the train, Rachel spies Jess in the backyard kissing a man—a man not her husband. She’s shocked and disappointed—how could Jess think of cheating on Jason, the perfect husband? Not long after this, Jess—whose name is really Megan Hipwell—is reported missing by her husband, Scott. Rachel, desperate to help, inserts her drunken self into the police investigation—and into these people’s lives—and the melodrama begins. Although I would have titled this book Drunk Woman With No Life Rides Train to Spy on People, the “train” part of the title (and book) is apt. The farther I got in this book, the more eye-rolling and mutterings of “give me a fucking break” occurred. I had to keep reading because this book is a train wreck—it’s bad but I can’t look away. This is a thriller that does keep you reading, but it’s a thriller of the worst kind—the plot depends on three dippy, pathetic women taking turns narrating the story. Rachel is the worst with her drunkenness, her self-pity, her whining, her idiocy and her pathetic need to insert herself into these people’s lives. She’s a black-out drunk with many holes in her memory. One of those holes becomes an important part of the plot. She’s a liar, she’s a slob, and she disgusts me. Unfortunately, the author has designated Rachel as the “detective” in the story. She’s going to figure out what happened and in the process, turn her life around! Anna is the “other woman” who eventually married Tom, Rachel’s ex-husband. She is a nervous, twittery woman who spends much of her time pissing and moaning about Rachel because Rachel comes by the house and stands outside, she calls them and once (drunk, of course) she snatched Evie the baby and tried to run off with her. What’s so ridiculous about all this is that no one calls the police. If my husband’s drunk ex-wife snuck into my house and tried to run off with my baby, I’d call the police. Anna doesn’t always trust Tom (what, not trust the guy who cheated on his wife with you?) but decides she’s being ridiculous for no reason. It’s all so annoying. Megan aka Jess, is nuts. She loves her husband, she doesn’t love her husband. She wants him to go away, she wants him to stay, she’s bored, she’s restless, she doesn’t know what to do with herself, she has a Deep, Dark Mystery from Her Past that’s still haunting her…oh, and she’s having an affair. Even Cathy, Drunk Rachel’s long-suffering flatmate, isn’t believable. It’s her house, she feels badly for Rachel (due to Tom’s cheating) but if I came home and found a pile of vomit and piss-soaked clothes at the bottom of my stairs, I’d kick out my flatmate. Bu-bye! Cathy (who we see only through Rachel’s gin and wine-soaked perspective) does evict her, but then changes her mind. Um, yeah. The women in this novel are all stereotypes of women you’d find in those soap-oper-y, b-rated movies. They all turn to drink to distract themselves from their problems, they twitter about indecisively, they’re going to Stand By Their Man (even if all the men in this novel are complete shits), and they cry  a lot. One or another of these bitches is always crying about something and apologizing. They all seem incapable of making intelligent, sensible decisions and taking control of their lives. That’s the shaky ground that Hawkins built this novel on—the absolute worst view of women possible, obvious misdirection, too many coincidences, and lots of hysterics. It’s exhausting.The coincidences are too much for me. Can two married couples live on the same street and their lives become entangled? Yes. Can the crazy ex-wife of one of these men just so happen to take the train that runs behind their houses and see them and get herself entangled in their lives? That’s stretching it a bit for me. Even though I don’t think any of these people are sane, their behavior still baffles me. If Rachel is such a pain in the ass, why doesn’t Tom call the police and report her behavior? He’s strangely reluctant to do so (and (view spoiler)[ the reason has NOTHING to do with the plot. In fact, if he HAD filed a formal complaint about Rachel, his life would have had fewer complications. He says so himself. (hide spoiler)]) instead he calls her and even has a creepy meeting with her in which he seems to encourage her attentions. If the point of all this is to warn the reader that Tom’s an asshole and a creep, yeah, we got that. But Scott, Megan’s husband, is also a creep. When Rachel goes sniffing around him (she’s trying to fulfill her fantasy of him as Jason, the perfect husband) and lies to him about knowing Megan, they develop a relationship that is frankly unbelievable. Just: WTF? The last main suspect is Dr. Kamal Abdic, Megan’s therapist. Frankly, I find his behavior unbelievable too. He behaves more like her priest (or a good friend who thinks she’s hot and wants her because in this book, all men everywhere want Megan because she’s so hot) and he allows her to visit him at his home. Red flag! More like red herrings. There are so many red herrings trying to distract the reader from the obvious killer that the astute reader should fairly quickly catch on. By about page 200, I was ready to chuck this book into the rubbish bin. A majority of it is the same thing over and over—Rachel gets shitfaced. She drunk dials-texts-emails-visits Tom or Scott. She says/writes/does something incredibly stupid (because she’s a drunk and an idiot). In the morning, she doesn’t remember what happened until she checks her phone or email account. Rachel feels badly—oh, woe is me, when am I going to learn that drinking to excess is bad? Then she compounds her stupidity by emailing/calling/visiting the person she bothered the night before to apologize…then she goes to the “off-license,” buys more alcohol. Repeat. During the times she’s relatively sober, she goes into “detection” mode to find out who really killed that nice Megan/Jess because the police are incompetent (and in this book, they really do come off as incompetent, so much so that as a reader I find it difficult to believe) and are going to arrest Scott/Jason, the handsome, perfect husband. Rachel as an amateur detective is unbelievable. She’s a drunk, she’s pathetic, and I have no sympathy for her. I have no sympathy or interest in any of the characters because they’re all creepy and/or assholes. I don’t care about Megan the dead woman because she was an unlikeable idiot and I don’t care who killed her (because I already know). The climax of the novel, when Rachel and two other characters are brought together in an unlikely and frankly ridiculous dramatic ending, just irritated me. It’s like one of those old movies in which the music is so incredibly dramatic (to let you know that THIS IS THE CRUCIAL MOMENT!) that you laugh. Or throw popcorn at the screen. Whatever your inclination is. That’s the ending to this book—completely ridiculous. Just so you know, my inclination is to throw the book on the floor and mutter, “Oh, fuck off.”The prose itself isn’t badly written. The pacing is good. If Paula Hawkins loses the hysteria and manages to write complex plots that don’t depend on all the characters, particularly the women, behaving like despicable morons, she might come out with good thrillers. If you need something brainless to read for a few hours, I suggest this book. In fact, take it on your commute to work. Just skip the pre-mixed cans of gin and tonic."
"1758",1757,"Erika","Meh.At least it only took three hours of my life away."
"1761",1760,"Jillian Salazar","I hated this book. The characters were pathetic and just all the way through not a page turner for me. "
"1762",1761,"Sharm Alagaratnam","Pile of crap. Avoid at all cost!"
"1764",1763,"Stephen Dawson","Clearly a lot of people like this book, and I'm happy for them: we all have different tastes. Maybe if I'd persevered I would enjoyed it too, but I found the writing style deliberately confusing and irritating; the characters were deeply unsympathetic, unengaging and just annoying; and to compound things the editing and punctuation were poor. In short, I found it tedious.I've read and really enjoyed a number of psychological thrillers recently, and I wanted to like this, but I ended up hating it.It's very unusual for me to give up on a book, but this has joined a short list of titles that weren't worth the effort."
"1766",1765,"Mark Hamilton","garbage. "
"1767",1766,"Willemijn","Ik vond dit echt een rotboek. Ik kan zonder te spoileren niet goed uitleggen waarom, maar de hele sfeer en de opbouw van het verhaal vond ik heel vervelend en naargeestig. Daarbij kreeg ik gaandeweg het boek een hekel aan zo'n beetje alle figuren die veel voorkwamen, haha. "
"1768",1767,"Prerit","Overhyped. Boring. Waste of time"
"1769",1768,"Nate","Sigh. "
"1770",1769,"Madelyn","Definitely not for me. Not sure why there are so many reviews out there that claim it is the new ""gone girl"". The characters were not believable and almost indistinguishable from each other. Found the book surprisingly dull despite murder, violence, affairs, etc. "
"1771",1770,"Martin Pingree","This was one of the worst books I've ever wasted my time on. There wasn't a single redeeming or interesting trait to any of the characters. Don't waste your time. "
"1772",1771,"Pavol Hardos","The Girl in The TrainwreckAs thrilling as an outdated train-timetable, as fast-pacing as the 8:13 stopping train from Fen Ditton. Written in the breathless style of Dan-Brown-robbed-of-his-thesaurus you might find this book impressive if you have only recently acquired the skill of literacy or if you are incorrigibly obtuse. The story is told from the perspective of three characters, they have names, but you sense that is just a convention to be able to differentiate them - they could just as well be numbered: cunt #1, cunt #2, cunt #3.The vulgarism is appropriate, I am afraid, I don't think there is any other word in the English language that could adequately capture their contemptible stupidity. It's hard to not see some anti-feminist intent in their design, so retrograde and overwrought female caricatures could not have been an accident, could they.But you will quickly learn to differentiate one from the other per the authorial intent: #1 is the main protagonist, our, for lack of a better world, 'detective', a highly unreliable, incompetent, and annoying one, saddled with a convenient alcoholism and a sad-sack ""personality"". The whole of her detecting consist of her running around, sobbing, drinking herself to stupor, trying to remember her blackouts - one of which is the night of the murder. #2 is the victim: there is a sense of moral evil in this book since one is tempted to help out, force the murderous hand, so she would finally snuff it. #3 is the authorial decoy, so painfully obviously a dummy, she can't possibly lead anyone to think that this might be the culprit. Yet there she is.After submitting us to 200 or so pages of #1's whining, crying and whinging the author finally allows her to ""remember"" a key piece of information that leads her to the killer. Conveniently, at the same time #3 also has a revelation (what a koinkidinky!) and that's when the last 50 'thrilling' pages commence. But we musn't let things get too thrilling: even as our #1 exits a building, pursued by the murderer, she has to have the time to stop and smell the roses - or in this case, the rain. She can smell the rain coming and notes that she loves the smell. The only thrilling thing about the book is whether you manage to finish before the frustrations get the better of you. Maybe you continue to hate-read onward, propelled by a sense of disbelief - it could not be that obvious whodunnit, could it? It could and it is. This turd of a book does not need a spoiler warning, it needs colonic irrigation to make it more exciting.In fact, you'll find more thrills in this old Monty Python sketch.

"1773",1772,"Sowmya","Hyped. Been wanting to read this forever but didn't find it as good as I was told it is. The story is tragic, no doubt, but in the end it becomes predictable. What's worse is that the women are all painted as having homogenous emotions around the one aim of holding on to that one special guy! 'The Girl on The Train' is in the end just a story about love and lust. Moral -'Don't drink and do anything, let alone take the train that goes by your ex's house every day' "
"1775",1774,"Juliana Maria","I started reading it expecting it to be interesting and involving but it ended up being a great disappointment considering all the reviews I read. I think the end is simply ridiculous. It looks like a cheap horror movie written by a beginner."
"1776",1775,"Marie","From start to finish I didn't like this book. A friend recommended this to me and I am utterly disappointed. Everything and everyone is a mess in this book and there is barely any plot at all. Maybe the little plot twist in the end was the only interesting thing in this book. There wasn't any character development, each of them was almost equally f***d up and did nothing about it. Had at least there been an interesting finish, something bigger and more important I would give this a 3, but no, this was the worst book I have read in years"
"1781",1780,"Sapphire","One of the worst things I've ever read. "
"1782",1781,"Sara Shields","Not as suspenseful as I expected, and totally predictable"
"1783",1782,"Chris Armendinger","Don't waste your time with this drivel... there are so many wonderful books, both classic and contemporary that are so much more deserving of popular praise. Predictable and poorly presented on every level, particularly character & plot development. I only finished it as it was my Book Club read. "
"1784",1783,"Lynn McMillen","This was my least favorite book of 2015. How did this unbelievable plot and story line make the best seller list. My entire bookclub hated it. "
"1785",1784,"Elizabeth","Did not finish, I truly couldn't care about what happens next less. "
"1786",1785,"Robert Russell","terrible, slow, boring, dumb... took a chance at the airport book counter and failed."
"1788",1787,"Fillyjonk","Utter tripe."
"1789",1788,"Anri","Didn't really like any of the characters - you know something's wrong when you're just hoping everyone will die soon..."
"1790",1789,"Erin Giesser","Ugh. One of the worst ever. Not good at anything....I didn't care about the characters. The writing was nothing special. It wasn't suspenseful. The whole plot built around a drunken blackout was dumb. And how many descriptions did we need of her drinking? A very poor spinoff of Gone Girl. I'll give this book away. "
"1791",1790,"Sally Alexandroff","Started good but was so full of ruducouks chance occurrences, I found it irritating"
