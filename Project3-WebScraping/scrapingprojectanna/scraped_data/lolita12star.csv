4,Catherine Morozova,4,3,"Я не понимаю, зачем читала эту книгу и зачем дочитала ее."
4,Annette,5,4,"I read about 75 pages and had to quit on this one. It's just too much when you have a 12 year old daughter to read about a dirty old man trying to romance a 12 year old. I just couldn't do it, classic or not."
4,AndreaZ,9,8,Disturbing. Same review for Love in the Time of Cholera. Why do people like these books about perverted old men sexually molesting teenagers? 
4,Casey,11,10,I just don't get it. Why was this so popular? I could barely stomach it and a quit 1/2 way through.

4,GM,23,22,لأنها مبتذلة، وشاذة، وحقيقية.. اكتسبت شهرة واسعة في العالم، لا أجد تفسيراً غير هذا !!! أشعر أنني خُدعت، أعتقدت أنها قصة حب بريئة بين شخصين يعوق اكتمالها تباعد العمر. قرأت شيء من هذا القبيل في أحد المواقع. ومع ذلك أريد أن أوضح إنني لست من عشاق القصص والروايات الرومانسية لكني اخترت هذه لمعرفة التبعات التي ستؤول إليها القصة بسبب هذا العائق. كان تخميني خاطئ بالطبع، لم تكن الرواية كذلك بل تخطت الرومانسية للقرف. لم أتوقع أن تقع بين يدي رواية كهذه التي خرقت كل الخطوط والمبادئ والأعراف الإنسانية والدينية. أصابتني بالغثيان حيناً وأرعبتني حيناً آخر من شدة الإجرام في هذه الرواية.بإختصار تحكي قصة شاذ جنسي يحب الفتيات الصغيرات عموماً. يؤثر هذا الحيوان الطاعن في السن أن يشبع رغباته الجنسية مع طفلة في العاشرة من عمرها مثلاً على إمرأة ناضجة.ما يؤسفني حقاً هو استمرار نوع هذا المريض النفسي وعدم انقطاعه من مجتمعاتنا، فنجد أخبارهم تملأ الصحف؛ هذا هتك عرض طفلة ما، والآخر يتحرش بإبنته وغيرها من القصص التي يشيب لها شعر الرأس. أنهيتها بصعوبة بالغة لما فيها من لحظات باعثة للإشمئزاز والإنحطاط الخُلقي.وللتذكير: أنصح كل أم وأب له طفلـ/ ـة أن يوفر لهم سبل الحماية الممكنة تفادياً لحالات التحرش من الغرباء، ومن الخطر الكامن الأشد ضرراً من الغرباء وهم الأقرباء. حمى الله أبناء المسلمين والمسلمات من أي مكروه. ***نعم لا أنصح بها أحداً البتة.
4,Megan Ammer,24,23,"I admit that I went into this reading with expectations and a little bit of hesitation. I knew the basic plot and controversy surrounding the novel, but tried to keep an open mind in addition to sitting aside basic opinions in order to comprehend this particular story. Unfortunately, due to my moral integrity or frustration, or something of the sort, this novel was extremely hard for me to enjoy. It took a while to reach a halfway point and I found myself struggling to the end. I didn't take to any of the characters; I found myself annoyed with the lot. I guess I felt sympathies for Lolita, at least enough to recognize that her situation was sexual abuse and kidnapping and to want Humbert to pay for all crimes committed, but I didn't like anyone enough to care much for the story. I suspected that much, anyway, before starting the story, but had hopes that the writing or some underlying hatred for Humbert would change my mind. Neither shone through, however, and the writing was just as hard to muddle through as the content. The language used is so juvenile, with euphemisms for sexual terms that made the whole narrative overwhelmingly awful. The language was too puffed up in order to disguise his criminal activity and too much time was spent trying to convince me that Humbert wasn't such a bad guy. The author, Nabokov, presented depictions of Humbert as a caretaker, loving father figure, and regular guy that failed over and over again as he continued to be the villain of this story. No amount of money spent could erase his flawed personality or bad narration. The only thing that kept me reading the novel was his incarceration, and even that doesn't end in death. I felt cheated when Humbert lives and Lolita gets killed off after living in squalor because she was forced to depend on Humbert for a childhood that taught her nothing but made her the sole victim. I despise Humbert and this story is just nothing but a terrible confession of a pedophile. I tried so hard to use outside material to better understand the story but could not agree with anything scholars had to say and found labels like ""comedic tragedy"" or ""erotic"" almost harder to deal with than the actual novel. "

4,Hope Rike,49,48,"I couldn't get into this book, I tried, I really did but in my opinion it's basically about a pervy pedifile"
4,Nathan Schwartz,52,51,"How, dear reader, shall I try and delve into the mysterious appeal of this overwrought compendium of strained metaphors and pretentious vocabulary into which I dove like a struggling child forced to learn to swim by an overbearing father, only to find the pool filled with tapioca. Such is the love for this sad little work that I am filled with trepidation at the chorus of disgust this review will surely evoke among simple minded readers; those who do not understand the harlequin longing for sentences that end without four or five parenthetical asides or a story that can be enjoyed without triggering the gag reflex on every page. Oh, the plot of the novel. The globules of gonadal glow. The grasping at the very the depths of distaste like a gynecologist feeling a tumor.Some, I have heard, justify subjecting unsuspecting diners at the binge and purge of a 1945 thesaurus strewn about this wretched story by suggesting the intent is satire. Someone may wish to remind them that satire is used to excuse everything, but in the end it excuses nothing, and subjecting me to this repellent story and then calling it satire is as clever as punching someone in the face and yelling “slug bug red”."
4,Rebecca Rogers,54,53,I could not even finish it; it was so disturbing. What made this book a classic? I get that the writing was great but the thoughts behind the writing are disgusting. As a relatively new mom I just couldn't deal with his description of his horrible manipulation of a mere 12 year old child. 
4,Ginger,59,58,Terrible--could not get through it!
4,محمد على عطية,64,63,قرأتها بدافع الفضول لأعرف لم هي (رائعة نابوكوف)...و لم أجد هذه الروعة!
4,Emarr99aol.com,65,64,"Who in their right minds likes Humbert and thinks Lolita is a temptress? And talking around saying something without actually saying it does not automatically define ""witty writing"" as I've seen in other reviews. It was a sick story. I can't remember one thing I liked about it. "
4,Koz,67,66,"There's no doubt Nabokov can write. But I couldn't deal with the content for many reasons. I wanted to appreciate it, but I couldn't muster it up."
4,Toreisii,68,67,"The fictional memoir of a pedophile who preys on a young girl named Lolita. I found this a tough novel to slog through with its overindulgence of French phrases (which I cannot read) and minutiae. It also left me emotionally numb, as if I had listened to a very long and boring lecture."
4,Hannah Glenn,70,69,"I know it's a metaphor but it made my skin crawl too much to get through the second chapter. I skimmed over the rest, thinking it might get better. It doesn't. "
4,Juna,76,75,read this for romantic love literature class at bryn mawr and hated it. its about pedophelia the whole class was like disgusted. i mean really i hate to be judgemental but its just hard to find the beauty in overt rampant abusive destructive pedophelia and child molestation. but i guess it was appropriate; it was 'romantic' in the sense that it describes a mutual seduction of two people
4,Kate Richardson,77,76,Not even well written enough to distract from the subject matter.
4,Priya,81,80,DNF . Too slow a pace for me to read it till the end . Took me a month to just get half the way . Giving up on it ! 
4,Isaac Cooper,82,81,"Lolita is the most pretentious book I've ever read. The characters are immensely unlikeable (even Dolores), the story is repetitive, and the pacing is so incredibly, mind-blowingly, preposterously slow it hurts my brain. But the way it's written! It's so beautifully written!No, it's not. Anyone can write flowery prose; they have a whole profession of it called 'poetry.' But even by poetry standards the flowery prose in Lolita is tedious, and overly-wordy. In fact, the prose becomes so obnoxious that it actually takes away from the story itself (not that there's much of one in the first place - a stepfather rapes his stepdaughter, there we go, that's the story). Almost every paragraph will be halted to draw a useless, pretentious metaphor for no other reason than because the author wants to. Prose is like cinematography in a movie. Sure, you can have really great cinematography, and it can be really pretty and well done and such ... but if it's not mixed in with an interesting, compelling story, and with conflicted and complex characters, it's just masturbation. In the end, that's what Lolita really is: artistic masturbation. There's no attempt to make us care about Humbert Humbert or Dolores Haze whatsoever. In fact, by the end of the novel, I despised both of these characters and wished them nothing but ill will. I'm not saying the subject matter is too transgressive, just that this particular novel handled it in the worst way possible. Flowery paragraph after flowery paragraph, I grew immensely bored with Lolita, and had no feeling other than annoyance to all the main characters in the story. Should I not feel the least bit of pity for poor Dolores Haze who is getting raped by her old stepfather every single night?Because in my mind, I really should feel empathetic to her, and maybe even toward Humbert Humbert, but I didn't, and I don't. I didn't feel anything. Nabakov's writing is so pretentious I can almost picture him standing over his typewriter, masturbating to it. "
4,Rejoyce,88,87,how did i manage not to realize what this book was about? horror. I am now scared to read any more russian authors. I feel dirty.
4,Melanie Chen,90,89,"After everything I had heard about this book, I was really excited to sink my teeth into it (hot chocolate, blanket, and dictionary.com close by). Now that I've finished, I honestly don't know quite what to make of it...I didn't like it. But I didn't dislike it either. Hence, this awkward state of tension I've carved for myself.I think my biggest issue with this book (aside from the subject matter, of course) was that the language itself had its ups and downs with me. I thought the prose was breathtaking at points, especially when HH was describing Lolita, and downright unnecessarily difficult at others. Especially when the book turns into a detective cat-and-mouse chase, I got a bit lost in the turns of Nabokov's winding sentences. As a self-implemented rule, I don't reread books (because there are so many out there that I haven't even read once yet!) but perhaps it is just a testament to Nabokov's skill that I must say this: This book BEGS to be reread.Oh, please, for the love of all that is holy, Melanie Chen, please, some day, way far from now, reread this book. There are so many elusive references and gentle reminders and nudges of word play that you undoubtedly missed the first time around! Perhaps now was not the best time. Perhaps after a boyfriend, a marriage, or maybe even a child, but some day come back and give a second glance to these pages.(I am glad I finally got around to reading it though. Till next time, then.)"
4,Leasha,93,92,Achievement in literature? Yes. Creepy as all get out? Absolutely. 
4,Chelsea Hosford,103,102,I hated this book.
4,Irina Garaeva,110,109,"I've read enthusiastic critics about this book and its deep ideas about love, importance of having the full family where parents really take care about children but - to tell the truth - I couldn't find any of these thoughts :( I've seen only vulgar story that sometimes is uncomfortable to read. Of course this is just my subjective point of view and I admit I didn't understand something - but no way I will try to reach the depth again, I won't re-read it, no-no-no!!"
4,Miranda,120,119,"If I could give this a negative star, I would. This book just creeeped me out. The writing is wonderful, though. "
4,Lhagen,123,122,Worst book EVER.
4,Renee,124,123,Quite possibly the most bizarre and disturbed novel I've ever read.
4,Romesh,126,125,Definitely not my sort of book...
4,Alison Annon,134,133,What. The. Fuck. 
4,Chi Chi,135,134,What a pretentious piece of crap.
4,Kate Rice,136,135,"My passionate dislike of this book is legend amongst my long time friends. When an ex brought this book into my apartment one evening;he and I got into an epic argument about how over rated and depraved a book this actually is. The argument concluded with me tearing his much wanked over paperback copy of Lolita in half and throwing it out the window of my SF Chinatown apartment onto Clay Street.He's lucky I didn't light it on fire, too.Needless to say, the relationship didn't last much longer."
4,Shantadee Gadson,138,137,"If I could, I would give it a negative star. I'm not interested in this book. Less then 15 pages and I don't care to read another page. The content is not for me!"
4,Shae/Shelver,140,139,"Pretentious, boring, and fails to elicit anything other than disgust."
4,Marissa,143,142,I read it because it is considered a classic. It pretty much weirded me out though. 
4,Aleena,145,144,"WHAT, IN THE NAME OF GOD, WAS THAT?It was grave mistake to read this book. I came across this book in a bookshop and was horribly surprised when I read scanned its synopsis. Later I searched on google and saying that I was surprised is understatement of the century.Why did I read it? Because of the reviews and my naivety and stupidity. Honestly, what was I thinking?Anyway, this book was like a powerful gust which swayed me off my feet, filled my mouth with dirt and gagged me. THIS WAS PEDOPHILIA, NOTHING ELSE. IT HAD NO HIDDEN PLOT. NO. NOTHING. The worst thing about this novel was not its plot but the fact that people actually like it!!! to the people who said ”it was beautiful, it was wonderfully written, it had a strong plot bla bla bla” and then blatantly wrote that it disturbed me and gave it 3-5 stars I’ll say YOU’RE FULL OF SHIT.It is a classic, I get it. But it is okay not to like them. It is not a good enough reason to like this book neither is “it happens” or “but look at its end” it is not a sin to dislike classics. I don’t care if it was written well because the plot killed and i did not complete I only read up to the point when lolita’s mother died and humbert and she go about travelling. Rest of the story I gathered from different reviews. I was feeling so horrible about the world by the time I started writing this. “Wonderfully written! Chilling! Best book! 

REALLY? REALLY?

 There is fine line between wrong and right, morality and immorality and anybody who has sight enough to discern that would say that paedophilia is way too far on the wrong and immoral side and that it is not okay, neither is a book written on it.P.S I get the fact that everybody has freedom to read and like whatever they want and I couldn’t care less but if you liked this book I will judge your mental stability."
4,EvaH,147,146,"Horrible, horrible story. It may have been written well, the story itself disgusted me (which may be the intention)."
4,Lialia,151,150,"I found this book so boring, the author goes round and round with the plot..."
4,Alisha Hanson-Glatzel,153,152,"Was Nabokov a talented writer? Yes. Is he a messed up ass who can't control himself and in turn damages others for his benefit? Yes. He gets no credit from me for his writing, he is a jerk who puts his pleasure over others pain. I have no idea why I tortured myself with this one. I got almost half way through and asked myself why I was doing this? Did I need to see into the mind of a pedaphile? Maybe, but I didn't need to finish it, so I didn't. Yuck!"
4,Menna,154,153,i wish i never read that. what a disgusting pedophile !!

4,Ayya,166,165,I hated this with every single fiber of my being. 
4,~*kath*~,172,171,"I hate this book with a passion. I personally believe that the only reason it ever gained any fame was because of it's taboo subject. If it were not so salacious, it would have been buried in time as the piece of sensationalist rubbish that it is."

4,Samah Al-Atwani,188,187,"It is just me or is there something really Wrong with this book... I mean, i had the impression that this book was the greatest book about love and instead it is about a pedofile killing a mother, abducting her child and then literally raping her. As if that is not bad enough, the main character makes it seem that is is the young girl who askes for it... Maybe i got it all wrong ?? "
4,R!x,189,188,"Debo admitir que me brinqué muchos capítulos... Pero muuchos, por no decir la mitad de libro. No soy de los que dice que un libro es malo solo porque no le gustó, y menos este del cual he visto muy buenos comentarios, mas bien prefiero pensar que no era para mi o no era el momento correcto para leerlo. No prometo intentarlo de nuevo porque no creo que eso pase, tengo la película y con eso complementaré las lagunas que me quedaron de la historia. Amén."
4,Marjuque,191,190,"Oh muse why? why compose such boredom? why such painfully lyrical horror of sentences so devoid of stimulus. Why such an impoverished story lacking on such various levels composed of such indifferent ramblings so appreciated by the masses, because of the idea? because of the begining paragraph-perhaps, the only redeeming quality of the book I presume. Justice certainly wasn't done to the idea, it was rendered ugly if anything else. the problem was not the idea but the narrow perspective that was taken. I practically slogged through the whole thing thinking, thinking, thinking, when does this end. Yes that's right this book was horrible. I have nothing good to say about it."
4,Gautama Siddartha,193,192,I didn't like this book for the fact that this is truth. 
4,Gianna,201,200,Too disturbing to read...I can find soooo many other lyrical books with better subject matter.
4,Paula Burdette,213,212,"It was a good, well-written book. I just couldn't stomach the content. It made me angry, sick, unnerved, near-despondent. Like I said, a good book, just not for me."
4,Kaushal,219,218,"For all its fame, I couldn't even finish the book. Gave up half way, and that only because it is considered such a big deal. Others may rave about it, but Lolita ain't for me. Waste of time."
4,Keisi Mancellari,220,219,I'm so surprised that some people liked this book. What in the world is there to like? There's this pedophile who... Does what every pedophile does. Moral? None. 
4,Véronique,222,221,Éloge de la pédophilie. Pas capable.
4,DaniEla,223,222,dnfThat's all.
4,Chloe,228,227,"I persisted in finishing this book because I was waiting for something, anything to redeem it. Nothing did, and it just kept on being relentlessly creepy. Like, am I missing something? Why is this book so popular/famous? Someone once told me that reading this book just made the reader feel kinda dirty. I agree. Time for me to shake off this novel with something more redeeming."

4,cagdas,237,236,SUCKS.
4,Jenn Kerns,241,240,"I found it disturbing to ""be in the mind"" of the main character as he lusted over a preteen. Well written, just beyond chilling and not somewhere I will tread again due to psychological curiosity."
4,Jessica Oban,243,242,"This book was written beautifully. Mr. Nabokov is a wonderfull author. So why am I giving it one star? Because of the story. It's about a pediphile. I'm sorry, I just couldn't read it. I wanted to, but I... just couldn't."
4,Nancy Hall,245,244,"For all the hype I read aboout this book, I was disapointed. It featured a lot of rambling."
4,Tessara Dudley,246,245,"I have been trying unsuccessfully to get through this book for four or five years. I am stalled at the halfway point now, because I am just sickened at the narrator and his terrible rationalisation of the rape he has committed --is committing.My copy of the book says on the back: ""The only convincing love story of our century."" -- Vanity FairPerhaps they read a different book than I did; I, for one, see no love here."
4,Caterina,250,249,"One star means what it says ""Did not like it."" The writing style was brilliant, but being inside the head of the protagonist was so vile that the book made me sick; I couldn't finish it. "
4,Brendan,254,253,"Although the writing was beautiful and the stories within entertaining, I could not get past my disgust of the main characters. If anything, I enjoyed it's American road trip commentary best."

4,Mellissa,258,257,"Absolutely disgusting! I read just over half of it before it became unbearable, I thought well this is such a recommended book, surely it wont be to graphic. I actually throw this book out, but trust me I wanted to burn it!Zero stars from me!!!"
4,Ivan,263,262,"A dreadfully, stupendously, mind-numbingly tedious tale of a codependent pedophile, which could have been three times shorter, and twice clearer for the fact. This so-called masterpiece of literature should be in place of a sleeping drug. A pretentious and trivial tale of a social case, diluted with some Russophobic undercurrents and unbearably smug commentary on most insignificant events and things. Nabokov was just another logorhheic twit who duped the world into thinking he was some genius. I am really disappointed having ever got my hands on this book, as the time spent on it was better spent on watching the grass grow, or basically anything else."
4,Kissu,268,267,"Había escuchado que era un libro erótico y, según sé, estuvo prohibido. Sin embargo, no tiene nada de erótico y la temática ya es muy vieja para mi gusto. Me pareció muy aburrido y el lenguaje que utiliza no es de mi agrado."
4,Molly Octopus,269,268,One of the most disappointing books I have ever read. I was bored to tears trying to get through it. The latter 2/3 of this novel reads like a travelogue.The plot devices he utilizes are nauseatingly cliche and convenient.Overrated.
4,Chrystal714,273,272,"I couldn't get through this book. I listened to the first disk only because I was on a long drive and forced myself. I just couldn't handle listening to a book written from the pedofiles prospective. It made my skin crawl, it made me want to vomit."
4,Sh3lly,275,274,"UNPOPULAR OPINION TIME:I wanted to read this for the 2016 reading challenge with the MacHalo group. Also, we chose it for our February Taboo Month. I tried. But, you know what? F-it. I think this book is shiat. Yes, I am saying it. I have no idea why this is a classic. I admit to being classics stupid, so maybe that's why I don't get it. But to me, this is just a glorified and accepted account of pedophilia. And BORING as hell.The author, and I admit I know nothing of him, creeps me out and I find him highly suspicious just for writing this. The main character is an idiot and being in his head is so trite. I don't find his way of thinking to be exceptional or intriguing in any way whatsoever. I don't find the way the author wrote him as being beautiful or intriguing in any way whatsoever.Here is what I think of when I think of Humbert Humbert and Lolita:I got to 15% and I am out. It would be torture for me to continue with this. And yeah, I'm giving it 1 star. I will find another book for the challenge. I want to kill this book with fire. I never want to hear the word ""nymphet"" again. But hey, I'm sure I read it wrong, so for those who loved this book, maybe I'm just too dumb to get it. I found it offensive and boring; I'm not sure which is worse. This guy was like 40 or something and romanticizing 12 year olds and trying to get in their pants. Yeah, you could just say it's this great fascinating study of a sicko's mind, but I still don't find that literary or beautiful in any acceptable way."

4,Molly Gray,283,282,A 12 year old? Yikes. Could not get passed that.
4,Stephanie A. Higa,285,284,"Nabokov's writing is dazzling, especially considering English isn't his first language, and it's the only aspect of this book that I didn't find totally repulsive. No amount of maniacal poetry and brilliant technique could make up for the actual goings-on of this story. Eventually even the writing began to grate on my nerves because Humbert Humbert is such a disgusting, repellent, horrible person with retarded delusions as well as an extremely annoying character. Every other line I thought, ""What a dumbass."" This ""dumbass"" echo got louder by about tenfold toward the end. How annoying is it to hear an incessant stream of dumbass dumbass DUMBASS when you're trying so hard to keep up with a poem in prose about a child rapist/murderer/psychopath? Trust me; it's worse than it sounds.I get the hype. I guess. I got it at about page three when I realized I hadn't read prose so delicious (the sound, not the excremental content obviously) in a long time. Clearly the book had nothing else to offer besides that and the foolish hope that it would end in literary revenge (foolish, because postmodernists don't like revenge), which is why I sped through the remaining pages. At least it was a fast read. Yeah yeah, Nabokov is a genius and all that, but god did I hate this book. Thankfully I got it for free from somewhere. Who knows.Also, no way in hell did I ever sympathize with the dumbass H. H. Nabokov's writing isn't THAT good. But I doubt anyone's is. No one could make something as awful as child abuse sympathetic...no one! For a real sympathetic psychopath committing a much more sympathetic crime, see The Talented Mr. Ripley (and, to a lesser, extent, Notes on a Scandal). No, the prose isn't as pretty, and the characters aren't as eloquent, but that's the point. Slick talking makes one more suspicious, not less."
4,Deb H,293,292,The worst. Bottom 100 books read. A horrifying look from the lens of a sociopathic pedophile. 
4,Nymphadoralestrange,298,297,The whole concept of the book is sick and twisted. It does not deserve all the praise it receives.

4,Pep,302,301,"Made me want to vomit the whole way through. It is written really well, but when one combines the topic with the real life of Nabokov. UGH. Makes me want OTHER books to wash this one out."
4,Tracy Roy,305,304,The prose is masterful. The subject matter is abhorrent and I was miserable the whole time. 
4,Debbie,307,306,"OK, so I didn't finish it. I just couldn't. ""HH"" was just too annoying. And unfortunately, the entire book consists of his rambling. I wanted to like this book so much and maybe I'm a lesser person for not seeing the beauty of it. The only part that I liked was him plotting to kill his wife - that was a little funny. Does that make me a bad person? I think this entire review makes me a bad person. Ohhhh well."
4,Katiekate,308,307,I started reading this but was too skeeved out to continue. Still sitting on my shelf and I likely won't finish it.
4,Phil Villarreal,309,308,"I hated this book throughout, and I would hope it's not just because I have a daughter. I suffered through the entire thing only to gain the right to smack down anyone who would apologize for this as something other than a child pornography/sex slave fantasy.The elegant writing and incredible skill involved only make me despise the book more. I don't think there's artistic validity here, and I would discourage anyone who feels as though they have to read it to be well-read from doing so. The book is full of agony and depravity, and it's sickening to attempt to put a human and relatable face to such a monster. I believe the literary world would be better off if Lolita did not exist."

4,Dana Abney,318,317,"I did not enjoy this book at all. While I can appreciate it on an intellectual level, I was emotionally sickened by the whole story. Definitely will be steering clear of this and books like it in the future. The subject of pedophilia and the way the main character justified his actions in his mind was not a perspective I enjoyed delving into. Like I said, interesting in an academic sort of way, but emotionally challenging. "
4,Erin Martin,322,321,Argh! I can't even rate this stupid book because I couldn't finish it. I read 189 pages and I was so sickened by where it had already been and where it was heading that I couldn't go on. I think it's because I have daughters and what he does to his step-daughter is not right and not good literature. I'm so mad at myself for reading as much as I did. Thank God for my last alternate for my reading challenge.
4,Gemma Herrero Virto,323,322,"Igual parezco una inculta por hacer este comentario, pero tengo que ser sincera. Me ha resultado infumable, pesado, pedante, aburrido hasta la extenuación. Lo he acabado por cabezonería pura, pero hacía muchísimo tiempo que no me aburría tanto leyendo un libro.El principio no es tan malo. De hecho, me pareció que el escritor había hecho un ejercicio de empatía sublime al poder ponerse en la piel de un pederasta y explicar sus emociones y justificaciones. Pero, cuando comienza la parte del viaje, el libro se vuelve aburridísimo. No se pueden llenar cientos de páginas con los pensamientos de un neurótico pedante y su relación con una cría superficial y caprichosa. En cuanto a trama, toda la parte del viaje no tiene nada. De hecho, lo único que estuve deseando todo el tiempo, era que se despeñasen los dos en alguna carretera y acabasen por fin con aquel sufrimiento.El vocabulario del autor es tan amplio que abruma (yo creo que tengo un buen nivel de vocabulario y aún así, no creo que haya habido una sola página en la que no me habría venido bien tener un diccionario a mano). Eso cuando no se pone a hacer larguísimas citas en francés.En resumen, una de las experiencias de lectura más tediosas de toda mi vida."

4,Sabrine Faragallah,344,343,"I've been waiting for the right time to use this word: abhorrent. And yet ever the empath, I feel the need to rationalize Nabokov's motive. While mildly interesting to understand a pedophile's mind, I couldn't help but wonder if Nabokov's goal was to make a mockery of English romance novels from Austen and Bronte. I began to piece together this hypothesis when I noticed how distracted I was by his overuse of esoteric English words and overly-dramatic first person narrative. To be honest, I started skimming through the passages 2/3 of the way in. Perhaps he felt slighted by the literary community that his native Russian works were not taken as seriously as he would have liked and his epic romance would be a vulgar and repulsive adaptation to forever curse English lit. I'm curious now to know ""the real"" Nabokov and might try another book of his to understand why a rational man would conjure such a story."
4,I Love Audiobooks,347,346,"Zero stars! What a disgusting, perverted, pretentiously-written piece of trash. And this is considered a classic of 20th century modern English literature? Really??!!! Jeremy Irons did a great narration however, but I almost felt sorry for him having to waste his talents on this sleazy excuse for a novel."
4,Juning,354,353,"I really didn't like this book at all! Never been so bored, and never used so many days to finish a book. Didn't like any of the characters in it, and felt disgusted with the main character. There was also too much French, which never got translated aswell. Not everyone speaks French. "
4,Rhonda Lundquist,356,355,"I think his writing is superb, but I am overwhelmed by the subject matter and the evil nature of the protaganist. I wouldn't say don't read it, it just was so vivid it made me feel sick."

4,Gita S.r.,363,362,I hate this book!
4,Athena,370,369,"I found this book to be so un-entertaining. Humbert painfully scrutinizes every single insignificant movement made by Dolores, even as trivial as itching a bug bite, and he's just so tortured. There was a very small section of the book where all that appeared endearing to me, and then I remembered that the object of his desire is an underage girl. I was not convinced when he claimed that she seduced him. He was a grown man, and even made a few references to how young girls had different views about sex. He claimed throughout the entire story to love her but he doesn't know how unhealthy his affections are. He created a co-dependency between himself and the girl Dolores Haze. He needs her, and now that she has no living relatives she needs him. He reminds her that if she should take off, or get away from him that she will become a ward of state. If he wasn't going on about Lolita, he was paranoid that she was cheating on him and raving about that. Or finally, just raving and ranting for the remainder of the book. Author's Note""Certain techniques in the beginning of ""Lolita"" (Humbert's journal, for example) misled some of my first readers into assuming that this was going to be a lewd book. They expected the rising succession of erotic scenes; when these stopped, the readers stopped. too, and felt bored and let down."" I quoted this because it's true, but there are a few discrepancies. The author says ""the rising succession of erotic scenes."" There would need to be erotic scenes to begin with, which there aren't. But if there were it would've made this book quicker to read, with a little more entertainment, despite the inappropriate nature. "
4,Olivera,373,372,"I haven't actually finished this, and now I have finishd my dissertation and have time to read, i really don't want to finish either! I dislike the narrator and story so much, I think I will force myself to read the end another time...."
4,shelby mosel,378,377,ugh probably the WORST book I've read in a very long time
4,Margarette,386,385,"I'm a little irritated that I went into reading the book based on what appears to be a completely off-base interpretation, it seems unfair to criticize an author on the basis that they didn't change how I think, since the cover indicates a love story, ""the only convincing love story of our time."" And i found it to be repulsive and there is never a good pedifile story. it's probably the most overrated book I've ever read. "

4,Antof9,401,400,"I read this because I finally had to stop reading ""Reading Lolita in Tehran"" because there were just too many references to this book! I thought knowing the general storyline would be sufficient, but I kept feeling like I was left out or missing something, and since I'd never read any Nobokov, I figured I might as well read the famous one.And then I had to write a review of this.I'm all over the board on this book, so I'm going to copy some of the comments I made in the past few weeks on the Book Talk Forum (at BookCrossing) about this book. Hopefully they make sense :)My first real post on this book: Reading a book that makes you want to read another book, where I talk about having never read any Nabokov before, and finally connecting his name (that I'd heard many times) with this book.And here is where I post 2 of my main points: 1. that I felt I was on the outside of a private joke (in RLIT) by not having read it, and 2. He is an amazing writer, but the subject matter is really disturbing me. In addition, the blurb on the cover from Vanity Fair ""The only convincing love story of our century"" makes me crazy. It's not a love story when it's one-sided pedophilia.So then I got more into the book, and realized that the foreign dialogue (mostly French) was making me crazy! I'm usually so good at a variety of other languages when reading a book that I take pride in it! But I feel like I missed out on a lot of this one because so many things were more than just a phrase or two. So I started a thread on that.And then someone else started a thread on not finishing Lolita, and I came out and said it: I thought it was awful. And used my strongest words yet: ""It's not a love story. It's about a pedophile and the girl who can't get away from him. Sure there's more to it than that, but WTF? It's definitely not a love story. I'm sorry. I'm not a prude, but it was almost trash. The fact that the writing is so good almost makes the reader sympathetic to Humbert. YEESH! I don't want to be sympathetic to him. He's a revolting ass!"" It's just fascinating to me that people think this book is so great. Or beyond that, that it's a love story! Sure, it's very, very well written. But that does not a great book make. I think. So as not to be totally negative, I'll say one thing about the humor. At one point Humbert Humbert is talking about the Russian cab driver his first wife falls for. He snidely says Oh, he was quite a scholar, Mr. Taxovich. LOL! A Russian taxi driver :) In the same opening chapters, he refers to something as ""Mc___"", also in jest, but I lost the bookmark to where it was and will NOT re-read till I find it. What it made me think of was on the television show ""Friends"", when they want to make fun of a characteristic of each other, say when Chandler smokes, Rachel might call him ""Smokey McSmokerson"". So are these funny names, used throughout the show's run, a literary nod to Nabokov? Could they be? I doubt it. But clearly this was written before that show!Last, one of the saddest parts I read was near the end: But the awful point of the whole argument is this. It had become gradually clear to my conventional Lolita during our singular and bestial cohabitation that even the most miserable of family lives was better than the parody of incest, which, in the long run, was the best I could offer the waif. Heartbreaking."
4,Andrei Silviu,404,403,"What a huge pile of s**t. I honestly think that this is one of the worst books I read. Completely boring, insulting, offensive, annoying and simply BAD. I had the feeling that this book was an incredible waste of time after reading about 10%. I went on to read about half of it. I regret ever thinking of reading this garbage. I found it simply bad, and if I were to describe it in three words it would be: Boring, Offensive, Repulsive. Huge waste of time. Worst book I ever tried to read. Hated every page of it. If i wasn't reading it on my kindle I'd probably had burnt the trash. "
4,Krishna,405,404,"Clever, alliterative and outright dazzling word play do not a good novel make.A fascinating and daring premise is rendered deadly dull by a sluggish pace that's stuck on neutral a good length of this tale of an obsessive and mutually destructive relationship."
4,Shannon Jackson,412,411,"No words for how disappointed I am. I went into this with high expectations, it was something I was really interested to read. The two main characters are both awful, vile creatures with no redeeming qualities at all, especially Lo/Lolita/Dolores/Whatever. She was an absolute brat from the very start and she didnt even grow on me. There was so much description that my eyes bled. Like really, three pages describing how good at tennis she was?! Really?! "
4,Michael Gao,413,412,"I tried guys, I really did try. But I can't do it, I just can't bring myself to enjoy any part of the book. I don't care how great the writing is, I just can't bring myself to finish it."
4,Erjon 7,416,415,"The worst novel ever written in the history of literature! If Nabokov wrote a novel so stupid and became famous well maybe some of us can write a good book and let see if there is a luck to become famous! I don't see any good reason to value this pervert story,writing style and meaningless novel...But that is the nature of people if we don't understand Art then let's spend our bucks with something ""censored""... Ohh and Nabokov used to judge and critique Dostoyevski! well where does he get that privilege?! He is so worthless in reading."
4,Tina,429,428,"First I have to apologize to all the very enlightened literary people out there who loved this story and found something special in its pages. I unfortunately did not:(I have struggled with what to say so I'm just going to share 
my
 truth. Firstly I read this with my book club, a group of 9 very smart and diverse readers and only 2 people (myself included) finished the book! So I can't be that far off base. At one point during reading this I was done trying to figure this story out, it truly made me feel so stupid!! I got the general gist but I know there was so much more. Nothing was clear, to me it felt like Humbert (the very unreliable protagonist) never said what he meant. I also felt like the tense kept changing? He constantly talked about him self in first person and third person... That was very distracting.I think this attempted to be funny but it was not for me. What I found the most intriguing about this book was how crazy Humbert is, in general I mean, because obviously you are not right in the head if you are in your late 30's and sexually attracted to 12, 13 & 14 year old girls. We all know that's crazy, but he was all kinds of other crazy too. I really wished I could have understood Lolita better but Humbert's view of her was too skewed, clouded and full of obsession. If we could get her side in a book that would be interesting as I think a lot of readers have just taken Humbert's word for what she was like. I just don't trust his interpretation of her... Finally this book is described by some as a love story... In my opinion this is not a story about love, love needs to be reciprocated for it to be, this was a story about obsession! "
4,Katehintx,436,435,"Really hated this book so much that I couldn't get past the first few pages. It seemed as though the author was trying to make excuses for his main character, a pedophile. Just couldn't do it."

4,Melanti,456,455,"5+ stars for Lolita. 1 Star for the Kindle edition of the annotated novel due to lazy formatting.There's around 200 pages worth of footnotes and they have a link to the footnotes at the front of each chapter - but no link on the things that are being foot-noted and no indication at all that they were discussed.There's no easy way to switch back and forth between the footnotes and the main text. To look something up you basically have to page backwards to the first page of the chapter, click on the link, then page forward through the notes to the item you're interested in, then admittedly there IS a link provided there to send you back to the main text.So to make the links work without constant paging back and forth, it's almost like you have to read the full notes for the chapter BEFORE reading the chapter. It's really distracting and pulling me out of the narrative. I thought it was going to be individual footnotes so I could look things up as I came across them - not one giant note for the whole chapter. (Little individual footnotes was how the intro is formatted.)You can jump from one footnote to another, from the footnote to multiple spots in the text, etc. But you can't jump directly from the text to the footnote!I think this is one book that would work a lot better with paper rather than this really poorly formatted ebook edition."

I was preparing a speech on freedom of speech at the time and it seemed like the perfect example. Having said that though, I was not a fan of the book, in addition to not liking the way it was written, I found it a little boring in parts, the only scintillating moments were found in his obsession with the 14 year old, and read when I say scintillating I also mean disturbing and completely perverted.

I had heard that it was one of those must read books, so i thought i would give it a try, but i could barely get through the first couple chapters, i actually quit reading this book. it disturbed me that much. It gave me way too much insight into how a pedophile thinks, and justifies his behavior. i have never not finished a book, i usually tough it out even if it is herrendous, i attempt to at least finish it, but this book is the only book i never finished. A grown man fantasizing ahout a 12 year old girl is disgusting and disturbing in too many ways. Especially when she's basically his daughter."

4,Tasha,511,510,"I have never thought any book deserved to be censored or banned until I read this book. I read it because it is a ""classic"" and a love story and I did not realize it was a novel about 40 year old Humbert's obsession with his stepdaughter, a 12 year old girl named Lolita. I was sickened by this book and kept reading in hopes that there would be justice for the disgusting things that happened to a helpless child. This books gives a glimpse inside the mind of a sick man and it is upsetting and awful to say the least. I would not call this ""literature"" in any form. Even if the story itself were not foul, the writing style rambles and is incoherent at times. This is a terrible book that should not exist. "
4,Serith,522,521,"I understand that this story is told from the perspective from an unreliable narrator –I really do– but that does not make it any more enjoyable to immerse in ...nor any more comfortable to read about Humbert’s obsession with “nymphets”. I doubt those that love this book would say that they enjoyed it per se; it’s not that kind of a read. But for me this was too ...real. Stuff like this happens. People like Humbert actually exist. It captures a part of this world that I don’t really want to look at. I don’t want to study it, nor do I want to understand the main character. It’s not that I want to pretend this stuff doesn’t exist – it’s just not my top choice for escapism. Honestly, it concerns me a little that some readers sympathize so strongly with Humbert (especially when his defining character trait is a pedophile who can write pretty words). There are also many readers and critics that don’t connect and see this more as a character study – which is redeeming. My interests simply don’t align.So this is not a book for me. I never suspected it was and I should have followed my instinct – I just wanted to try something out of my comfort zone? Broaden the horizon a little. I gave it a shot and now that opportunity expired. Book closed. Sorry, but I think I’ll be much better off not finishing this one."

4,Quanjun,550,549,"This is not a book that can be summed up in a 5 star rating system. You can't say, simply, ""It was amazing!"", ""I really liked it"", ""I liked it"", ""It was ok"" (the least possible of all choices), ""I didn't like it"", about this book and leave it at that. You'll find that you have to qualify your choice of number of stars, at least I do, so here it is.Let's take Nabokov's point, that a novel is for aesthetics and aesthetics only, it holds no moral, no point, it's purpose is for enjoyment. Enjoyment, you say. But here's where I have to split with the author's opinion about his own work. This book is narrated by a pedophile, not about his choice of icecream, but about his choice of victims, his acts of crimes. It cannot possibly be read in a vacuum where the reader doesn't care about these morals but only care about the beauty of the prose and imagery. So do we really end up enjoying it? No. Really, no. I won't speculate about Nabokov's motives. But imagine if this was instead, an actual romance novel between, say, two appropriately aged lovers torn apart by war. Would it not have been that much more enjoyable? If the language was used on actual love instead of this depravity masquerading as love, would we not love it, read it over and over again, declare it the best love story ever written? But instead we get this. Layers and layers of lies and deceit and just when you think it can't get worse, with great erudition, it does. In fact it gets so bad that it overshadows whatever opposite effect the prose is having.However, I've always liked novels that push the boundary. We can't live in a world where all books are written to be safe, to be feminist, to be for, I don't know, freedom. Because our world isn't like that. This book is refreshing, you don't expect this subject to be written, you don't expect it to be treated this well, you don't expect to read such a damaging crime in romantic words, and that's what was delivered. There is great skill in this book. I said I hated it. I do hate Humbert Humbert. He disgusts me. And to read the book is to be in his head, you want get out, but not before he dies. I feel I can only give the book extreme ratings, one or five stars. Nabokov demonstrated great skills, it is a novel of great achievement, it is extremely difficult to read, let alone enjoy.Nabokov said that people who can't finish the novel or refuse to read about a maniac are sheep. That's a little pretentious. There are many who would be beyond disturbed by the happenings in these pages and I think it's inhuman to say that inability to read through is weakness of intellect. Surely humans are composed of more substances than mere intellect. I'd barely made it through. But what I find repulsive are the throes of reviews who call this ""erotic"", a ""love story"", a ""romance"". I don't know if people are trying to pretend to get a supposedly great novel or letting their own depravity show through because they mistake the novel's popularity is a sign of the general populace's leaning favourably towards pedophilia. Don't read a fiction and pretend to understand a crime of this magnitude and think that you can legitimately (credibly) blame a book for your morals. Humbert Humbert is unambiguously portrayed as a villain. This is something I didn't want to add to my review because I thought it would be obvious. Do people discuss if murder is moral because of a book? No. But now everyone's pretending as if the book opens the discussion to whether rape and pedophilia is acceptable or ""understandable"". Get over yourself."

4,Nikola Sichlerova,570,569,"I expected a lot, but finally I was very disappointed. The book is basically full of Humbert's imaginations and descriptions of Lolita and his passoion for her. Reading endless descriptions of how this fourteen-year-old was beautiful and important for him was just a pure loss of time and I got stuck with this book for so long, because I always had to literally force myself to read it. There are only two things I would appreciate 1. the vocabulary and language used are excellent, 2. the idea and the very story line and basically the unique charm of the whole story are pretty remarkable along with really sophisticated character of Humbert Humbert."
4,Abby,578,577,"Oh gosh, this book was difficult to read. I appreciate the fantastic writing of Nabokov, of course, but Lolita is a horribly troubling and disturbing story. "
4,George,581,580,"Believe me, I tried. Several times I have tried to pick this book up and read it. While I appreciate his writing style, it's too difficult for me to get over his preferrences in women (haha). Maybe after I take a semester of abnormal psychology I'll be able to read this. But now, I just get way turned off by it. SORRY. "
4,Sinem,583,582,"Tamamen vakit kaybı. Bir ayı geçkin zamanda anca okudum zaten, bitmedi lanet şey.Kitabın neden bu kadar meşhur olduğuyla ilgili olarak şöyle bir tezim var; Batı'nın kibri. Batılılar orijini Rusya olan Nabokov'u kendi dillerinde yazı yazabildiği için yüceltmişlerdir. Ki Nabokov da tüm kitap boyunca Avrupa'ya ayrı Amerika'ya ayrı övgüler dizmektedir. Hayatının büyük kısmını Amerika'da geçirmiş bir insanın İngilizce gibi basit bir dili yetkin olarak kullanmasının övgüye sebebiyet vermesi Batı'nın kibrindendir. Bu kibir Batı dışındaki herkesi ve her şeyi küçük görmelerinden kaynaklanır. Ha bir de yazar Batılı birçok yazara selamlar çakıyor kitabında, bu da kitabın övülmesindeki önemli nedenlerden biri gibi geliyor bana. ""Batı orijinli olmayan biri bizim dilimizde bir kitap yazmış üstelik de bizim yazarlarımızı övmüş o halde neden bu yazarı ve kitabı göklere çıkarmıyoruz?"" tamam olarak fikrim budur.Kitaptaki ana konunun ahlaki olup olmadığı başlı başına bir tartışma. Ben kitabın toplumsal açıdan ahlaki olup olmamasıyla ilgilenmiyorum. Ama pedofiliyi bu kadar öven ve kitap boyunca meşrulaştırmaya çabalayan bir karakteri okumak hiç hoşuma gitmedi. Kaldı ki Nabokov kitabın sonuna kitabıyla ilgili olan hislerini yazmış ve orada da kitabında anlattığı konuyu normalleştirirken ""benim kitabım bölümler ilerledikçe pornografinin arttığı tarzda bir kitap değil"" argümanını kullanıyor. Kitabın pornografik olmaması 12 yaşında bir kızla 48 yaşında bir adamın cinsel ilişki içinde olmasını normalleştirmez benim açımdan.Kitap konu olarak zaten can sıkıcıyken bir de tarz olarak, kurgu olarak da yeni hiçbir şey sunmuyor. Rusya kökenli bir adamın -ingiliz dadılar tarafından büyütülmüş olmasını es geçmeyelim- İngiliz dilini yetkin biçimde kullanıyor oluşu kitabı Türkçe okuyan bizler için aslında hiçbir anlam ifade etmiyor. Kitabın ana konusu bu çarpık ilişki olmakla birlikte yan konu olarak da Amerika'yı boydan boya geziyoruz. Yazar bol bol çevre ve doğa tasviri yapıyor. Fakat ben kendi adıma Türk edebiyatında tasvirin allahı olan Yaşar Kemal ile zamanında haşır neşir olduğum için bu tasvirleri de zayıf buldum. Bu da kitabı orijinal kılan bir taraf değil.Tüm kitap boyunca 12 yaş çok küçük ya, istediği kadar kız rıza göstersin 12 yaş çok küçük diyerek okudum. Bir de hikayenin ana karakteri olan adam sadece bir adet 12 yaşında kıza aşık olmuyor. Adam tüm kızların ergenlikten hemen önceki dönemine vurgun. Fiziki olarak ciddi bir sorunu olmayan tüm kızlara hayran. Lolita'ya saplantılı derecede aşık ama 9-14 yaş aralığındaki neredeyse tüm kız çocuklarını seviyor. Bu durum da ayrıca çok rahatsız edici."

I had it, I read it, it made me feel dirty, and not in a good way at all. Maybe the Russians should stick to writing in Russian. And I'll put in a spoiler. The protagonist's occasional references to being incarcerated are NOT for his actions toward and against the title character. Whoa. Were there a ZERO STARS rating, that's what I'd give this one."

4,Jana,593,592,"When I was 19, I had a few affairs with younger boys. They were 17, scared like little chickens, because I was so adult and experienced, had so much to teach them. Some of them are gay now (I knew it! :), some of them pretend they’re not, some of them I see during my commuting and sometimes we politely say hey although sometimes we don’t recognize each other, and then in my dreams I have a blink blink moment, ah yeah, that kid... I sound like a slut. When I smelled Humbert Humbert’s pedophilia - it made me sick. No matter the language, Nabokov’s brilliance, no matter how an average reader doesn’t understand how this book is important. Basically, it’s just having sex with children. 12 years old children being gnawed by sickos. So I can’t willingly say that this this … this, this is goddamn the ultimate fucking best book I’ve ever read in my life. Bumbling, rambling, twisting, jumbling, sweating and pounding about having sex with children. Just to slightly turn the dice, not many people read Unni Drougge's book 'Hella Hell', about HumbertA Humbert. I wrote this review in 2002: 'You have to be ready and prepared for this book. But be open. It's not pornography, but man.' But, then man, then I was just a kid as well. Me and my bubbly hormones set off to build new pyramids. Because then I wasn’t working with teams who have to convince the children/teenagers - that it’s not their own fault."

4,Alyssa,612,611,"Written like a grocery list. If the only reason this book is a classic is because of its prose, there wasn't enough prose to get past the damn waste of paper and space with lists of crap he saw, what he bought, how good looking he is. The only interesting part was at the last few chapters. 95% of this book was boring, there were hardly enough breaks between paragraphs, most of the description was for, like i said, what he saw, what he bought, how good looking he is and where he went with the girl. Just watch the movie."

Don't remember it well enough to give a star rating.Also, the copy I have, with this same ISBN #, is the first Vintage International edition, from March 1989 and a different cover, not the reissue edition for the 50th anniversary of the publication.Okay, the repulsive is too much. If you start, it's worth going to the end tho. Nabakov unmasks the freak, and you can see that Lolita was utterly and completely not complicit in any of what happened to her, and certainly didn't love HH or desire him sexually. She was a sex prisoner, with no family, repeatedly calling HH her father and dad. Nabokov wrote a multi-layer incredibly language-rich text. But I'm not a literary critic - I just have to choose 'did not like', 'it was okay', 'liked it', 'really liked it', or 'it was amazing'.It was amazing, and I really didn't like it. 1 starGoing to do a 're-read' via Jeremy Irons narrated audiobook for classics club group read June 2014.

4,Adrienne van der Watt,624,623,"I was really excited to read this book, as it has gotten such rave reviews... HOWEVER... its a story of a paedophile... the thought was so completely off putting, I had to abandon the book half way through it. Maybe I will give it another try, because admittedly it is extremely well written, its just the subject matter that I could not stand."
4,Lidia,625,624,"When i started reading this book i already knew it was a classic, so you cannot blame me for having certain expectations from this novel, which eventually turned out to dissapoint me greatly. The first thing i cannot still quite comprehend is the accuracy of the description of H.H.'s states and sentiments, now how can one describe so amazingly keen a paedophile's feelings without being one? Either Nabokov was a genius, either he sensed those feelings himself. This storyline is disturbing in so many ways and damaged on so many different levels it sickened me. Humbert may write hundreds of poems and songs trying to declare the love he felt for Lolita, but he still didn't fool me into believing it. He acted always to his own benefit, selfishly and egomaniacally. The only thing i did enjoy about this book while reading it was its rich vocabulary, which did not cease to astonish me, for i am longing for poetic and literary middle engligh and late middle english vocabulary. As for the rest it really is a obscene plot with an even more sinister ending."

4,Anas  Alhaisony ,630,629,"Technically, When it comes to the language, the witty style and the entire play as a literal piece of work , it deserves 5 stars. Unfortunately , I've have never read anything more nasty and disgusting than this book.Therefore, and out of moral point of view, this book deserves only one star and this rating is too much for this mentally sick and morally ill writer and narrator. What I am trying to say is that the world has many interesting books and this book should be the last one you read. :)"
4,Rich Pliskin,635,634,"Overrated. It was a slow, largely uninteresting read, and not because of the lack of steamy sex; it was just tiresome to spend so much empty time with a thoroughly unlikeable character. Plus, if you don't read French, you're screwed. Seemed dated, too. I found the narrative style distracting, indirect, pretentious and florid, especially given the brutal subject matter. He kidnaps and repeatedly rapes a teenager, after all. But what do I know?"
4,Tammy,637,636,Ick!
4,Rsr,639,638,"Nabokov es considerado uno de los grandes autores del siglo XX y su novela Lolita es la obra más conocida y polémica. Con un control de la lengua envidiable, el autor desarrolla la historia con una cantidad de adjetivos, descripciones y alusiones a otros autores y obras, que alargan innecesariamente una historia que tan solo llevaría la mitad de páginas contar. Uno mismo tendría que darse cuenta que los párrafos no deberían llegar a longitudes de dos páginas y media.Las personalidades de los dos personajes principales están muy bien conseguidas y Nabokov consigue transmitir hasta el más mínimo detalle. Por otro lado, el resto de personajes están meramente nombrados, sencillamente porque son necesarios en el desarrollo de la historia, un echo que ayuda a reafirmar la obsesión de Humbert Humbert en torno a Lolita y a si mismo.Hasta el inicio de la segunda parte, la dinámica del libro aun es sostenible. La historia se adentra en el pasado del protagonista, para entender el estado en el que llega cuando conoce a Lolita. Esta parte es relativamente amena y la secuencia de acontecimientos es más o menos ordenada. La segunda parte sigue un hilo de acontecimientos más borrosa. Los giros importantes en la historia los destaca para luego perderse en un sinfín de anécdotas, generalidades, ideas vacuas y fantasías, siguiendo un cierto orden y a la vez caótico. Esas idas y venidas junto a los párrafos interminables con más adjetivos juntos de los que jamás se hayan visto hacen su lectura pesada, aburrida y se llega a perder totalmente el interés por el argumento principal.Este libro es recomendable para aquellos que no les importe leer un relato espeso y complejo, que disfruten de un vocabulario culto y sean lectores de otros grandes clásicos de los cuales Nabokov cita la mitad."
4,Amber,640,639,I didn't like this book. I had to put it down after the first few pages when I realized the author was trying to make me sympathize with a pedophile and a child molester (shudder). I totally felt guilty for reading the few pages I did. Yuck.

4,Jimmy,649,648,"Lolita is a remarkable book. Not because it is good, but because of how damn dull and boring it was. And how uninteresting a character Humbert Humbert manages to be, despite his perversions. Has there ever been a more boring character? What, other than his pedophilia, makes him interesting? He is a shallow man with shallow pleasures. The only thing I got out of this book is the complete banality of evil, which (the phrase in itself) is banal.If you're reading this review, it's quite likely that you already know me and my tastes a little. So I hope I don't have to convince you that I don't hate this book because of the content/subject matter. In fact, I root for it. I root for this kind of subject matter to actually be able to move me, or to illumine some portion of human experience heretofore un-illumined. No, I don't seek a moral. But some kind of depth, yes. Some kind of literary 'umami'. However, no such illumination or depth came.And yes, I see the point (maybe), that this intense aestheticism is his out, it's H.H.'s way of life. It's his moral substitute. But I don't buy it. I think it's Nabokov's out. I think it's his way of not having to come up with anything of substance, but to be completely surface, to be fluttery and butterfly-ey, so that he can rely on his strengths -- i.e. pure surface-level prose, inane and beautiful in that ""decorative"" way. Yes, I mean that insultingly. The guy can write, but for what? He's like a guitar god, wanking out the notes. It's pure masturbation.I have no idea why so many people (and people whose taste I respect) revere this guy."

4,Stephanie Rogers,662,661,"First- the writing is amazing. Second- the story line and realism that the acts and emotions are described with is beyond uncomfortable. As a work of fiction this may be the masterpiece it is hailed to be, but as a story, it is deeply disturbing. "

4,Bonnie Gail,666,665,"I forced myself to read this book as it carries great literary prestige. However, it was a constant battle with myself to keep reading. The redeeming value to the story is Lolita stating, something to the effect of, he was the criminal he broke my heart, you only broke my life."
4,Colin Geer,667,666,"Not my favourite book by any stretch of the imagination.It was, for me, a dreadful example of self indulgent, literary grandstanding, written to impress the reader with its technical linguistic virtuosity. It is almost universally praised and because of this and the plaudits that have been heaved upon it, I approached the book with an open mind. However, after finishing it - and I had to work hard to plough my way through to the end - I could not shake the feeling that this novel seeks to bolster the age old male myth of the promiscuous under-age female; the child-woman who leads men on: the knowing young sirens who are to blame for their own abuse.I have read much of the book's wordplay and the amazing feat that Nabokov pulled off - of having written a novel as 'good' as this in his third language. Well, woop-de-do. After pages and pages of alliteration, of clever juxtapositions and fascinating asides in French, all I could do was grit my teeth at the 'look how clever I am' writing being pushed in my face. An apology for paedophilia is still just that, no matter how well and cleverly it is written, and I would dispute even that reading of this book. 'It's just a story, it's ironic, it's literature' I have read many times, but no, I just don't buy into this view.Needless to say, I did not enjoy it."
4,David Burke,672,671,"It seems a shame to waste such rich prose on such a repulsive story. After high recommendations for this book in various -how to write fiction- type guides I felt compelled to read it despite the subject matter. Overall, there is nothing redeeming here. "
4,Alyse,676,675,"I am SO glad I'm done with this book. Of course the subject matter was disturbing, but I was actually VERY bored. One major complaint: 5-10% of this book is in French! I don't speak French and I have absolutely no intention of Googling every single word, phrase, sentence in this book that was not English. I am sure I missed some content this way. Whatever. Another major complaint: Humbert was horribly annoying. I did not feel bad for him (as many other readers report), I was irritated by his cultured and intellectual mask. His ramblings were out of control, impossible at times to follow and often seemed to be completely pointless. I am so glad to be finished with this book. I can say I read it and I could have a conversation about it, but I thought it was absolutely terrible. "
4,Adri Fernandez,680,679,"For the longest time I avoided reading this, because I always thought of it as quite worthless, in spite of how much the rest of the world considers it a “Classic”. But I am a firm believer into the notion that in order to be “justified” when hating something, you have to know what the heck you’re talking about, which in the case of a book means you have to read it. So I submitted my very unwilling self into a forced reading of a book I didn’t want to read. Which is the wrong approach to reading, really, reading needs to be spontaneous, a book (no matter how beautiful) won’t have any value if it’s forced.Did you ever wonder why so little people like reading? Because they got forced into it when they were kids, and not only did they get forced into it, they got introduced into the “horrors” of reading with books that obviously weren’t meant for them, which made the whole experience more excruciating, hence they marked in their brains forever and ever as “reading equals no fun and frustration”. I’m talking about you, crazy English teachers…Even though I tried to start this with an open-minded approach, I couldn’t avoid my underlying disgust with this book, and I have very little patience with it. And now that I’m 3/4 into it I can just barely stand it (at least I was, when I started writing this post, I’m quite done now, and happy to be done). The only reason I can keep going is simply because I can read, no matter how annoying it is, because I have other “better” books waiting for me to get done with this crap, so I can be a happy enthralled reader again, and one annoying book can’t kill my interest.For those of you that don’t know it, or who have had the luck to only hear about it, Lolita is the story of a man, who develops a very unhealthy infatuation towards a twelve-year-old girl. Some descriptions go along the lines of “A man developing disturbing feelings towards his stepdaughter…” but this, although to a certain degree true, is not correct, and it doesn’t properly imply the actual despicable character known as Humbert Humbert.You see, monsieur Humbert, didn’t just suddenly sprout a sudden interest towards his stepdaughter, oh no, darling, unfortunate monsieur actually has a history preceding his encounter with the little waspish girl, a certain Lolita, endearing nickname of one Dolores Haze.Be warned, this post is full of spoilers, so if you wish to read the book (I have no idea why anybody would willingly want to read it, unless they’re insane like me – don’t be like me) and don’t like knowing how it ends, stop reading this blog post.The Story:The first part of the book (the whole book is written in first person, as a sort of “confession” from a convict) is dedicated to monsieur illustrating his past, describing his first childish love and the failure of that first adventure.When you read comments from people, describing how already in chapter 4 of the book Humbert describes himself kissing his darling Lolita’s open mouth, it makes you wonder if anybody did actually ever even read the damn book.Probably not, because if they had they would know better, and they would know that the open mouth didn’t belong to the title child, but instead to another, some Annabel, who was at the time the same age as the sad Humbert. And while their behavior was not exactly within the norms of decency, at least it was somehow “natural” (I hate this word), and between two clueless kids.Now, the whole book seems to imply, even though the Humbert character himself scoffs at the idea (by constant “nabs” meant for the “psychiatrists” reading his confession and trying to “rationalize and analyze, and explain” his behavior), that his obsession with early pubescent girls was born from this fatal failure to realize his carnal wishes with Annabel, that for the rest of his life he tried to fulfill his desire with surrogates, and failing, of course.(view spoiler)[Monsieur Humbert actually got married in this story, twice. His first marriage crashing into a Divorce and his second marriage finishing in a more tragic way. During his description of his second marriage monsieur Humbert often laments to not being able to use the same “techniques” he could apply on his first wife, in order to get his way, since he had to keep a charade of dreamy ideal behavior to enthrall the mother of his little darling Lolita. In other words he not only was a Pedophile who married without interest or love, but merely to put up an appearance of decency, but he also was an abusive husband who threatened his first wife in order to “keep her in check”. This, however, didn’t stop his first wife from finding herself a lover and eventually running away with him, and thus divorcing monsieur. Humbert reports with some complacency, that his ex-wife and her new husband died in some badly conducted experiment.After this divorce Humbert moved to New York, to claim an inheritance, which allowed him to live comfortably without really working, and to pursue weird pointless projects that brought him in some extra cash to keep on living an easy life. This part of the book is ridiculously boring and pointless really, Humbert is a detail freak, he goes into endless elucidations of his activities, of his “little” obsession, of the habits he cultivates to somehow curb the sharp cruel edges of it, with little luck as he ended up having nervous breakdowns, of how he came to design the definition of Nymphet, pages and pages that kill your brain cells one by one and convince you that getting shot in the foot would be a better option than reading on.Eventually, circumstances arise that allow him to enter the Haze household, completely by accident, he wasn’t even planing to stay, until of course he finally came to behold the object of his desire, the incarnation of every past, present and future desire, Lolita. It is in this household that a (very stubborn and persistent) reader gets finally introduced to the title child and her mother (destined to become the second wife). It is in here, where the story actually starts, where monsieur focuses all of his pointless obsessiveness for detail into describing each and every little encounter with Lolita, whether it be just an accidental glance or a long “innocent” meeting (innocent because nothing really happens, but not really because of the way Humbert talks about them), and records everything in a tiny little diary of his.Lolita’s mother falls in love with Humbert, and confesses to him through a letter, that she leaves behind while she’s driving Lolita off to a summer camp. Humbert at first is disgusted at the idea, but then he contemplates the possibilities and decides that marriage is, after all, the best option. So he marries her, and is baffled by the discovery that Mrs Humbert, seems to be a very bossy kind of woman, she also seems to shatter all of Humbert’s plans, by planing to send her little girl to a boarding school (oh! The horror!). While our Valiant Humbert is trying to work out a way to make his wife see reason, disaster strikes, for she, curious and jealous woman that she is, discovers his secret diary.“Hell hath no fury like a woman scorn’d”And furious she was, understanding the nature of the betrayal, she set forth to write some letters, one for her daughter, one for divorce and one for Humbert. But alas, on her way to the mail collector, she got run over by a car, her missives in her hand and soon destroyed, her anger extinguished like her life, and Humbert feeling that fate was on his side indeed.So he did what he wanted to do all along. He managed to snatch Lolita off from the summer camp, and got her all to himself, for a while. The first year found them traveling from town to town, and state to state, pretty much all over the place. The book here is so unbearably dull, that I couldn’t even focus on it properly for most of the part. Which is absurd since here is when things actually happen.Oh, Humbert Humbert had the most harmless intentions at first, he just wanted to revel in his trophy’s glory, with her unconscious, and him “safely” and “harmlessly” fondling her (as if this made it all less disgusting…). But Lolita would have none of it, after confessing that indeed she already got initiated into the activities, she hastily went to show Humbert what she learned…After pages and pages of pointless listing of random places, and accounts of the subterfuges Humbert had to resort to control the little monster he was creating, parenting ignorant that he was, monsieur and “daughter” settled for a considerable length of time in a little town, equipped with a little private school for girls, where she could get educated in the life changing matter of “how to catch a husband”, as was the case at the period of account.It’s basically all downhill from here, spoiled and traumatized creature that she was, Lolita grew to despise her “father”, who didn’t fathom anything until it became glaringly obvious and entirely “too late”. Feeling that she was slipping away from his grip, he panicked, and again dragged her off to a second road trip. This is another thing that makes you wonder if anybody ever read the damn book, at no point did she ever grow to be in love with him, indeed Humbert often laments how she would recoil from any of his amorous endeavors, and just barely tolerate his advances, although it didn’t deter him from exploiting her dependency on him to get his way with her.The second road trip did not go the way Humbert wanted, on the first road trip neither of them had a plan, but on the second one Lolita was the one with a plan, and Humbert had no more than a dim idea on how to bind her to him forever (very sick ideas actually). During most of this mindless listing of places (again), Humbert notices a recurring figure. At first Humbert (at least self-aware enough to know that he was a fanciful paranoid creature) half believed it to be just a figment of his paranoid imagination. Thus the road trip proceeded, Humbert, Lolita and their mysterious pursuer whom Lolita seemed to know closely.Pages and pages of nonsense, with Humbert becoming paranoid, Lolita at points irritable, at points distant, at points quietly complacent and a mysterious man pursuing them and becoming bolder over time, coming into fleeting contact more often, and more frequently, looking at his own object of interest (Lolita herself), as old and despicable as Humbert himself. And then, Lolita got severely sick, and needed to be hospitalized due to a rather debilitating cold. The same cold Humbert himself got a few days later, which incapacitated him so badly, he could not go pick her up on the day she got released from the hospital, instead she got picked up by her “uncle” known also as the man pursuing them. She basically went from one pedophile to another…and disappeared.Poor Humbert, you almost feel sorry for him at this point, almost.The rest of the book is just him explaining what his life was “after Lolita”, of his futile attempts to find her and of what he did after he realized she was gone. The whole book is exceedingly boring (in spite of its main theme) and this part is the most boring of it all, really. Ah, but the book is not over, it just goes on and on analyzing his boring endeavors at life until, just as you start asking yourself why you’re still reading, a letter by the elusive Lolita finally comes.She’s married, and pregnant and in grave economical disgrace, as could be expected. Humbert finds her, and sees her and tries to persuade her to go away with him, but she won’t budge.And here we finally hear the truth, she had never any interest in Humbert, in truth she cared about another, of Humbert’s age, the mysterious pursuer, whom she calls Mr. Cue endearing shortening of one Clare Quilty, former neighbor and close(ish) friend of the Haze household, a famous playwright, who had been lusting after Lolita’s impressionable mind long before Humbert came into the picture, and who eventually stole her away from him. It was with Mr. Cue with whom Lolita designed the itinerary of the road trip, him who followed, him who eventually picked her up from the hospital, him who threw her out when she didn’t do what he wanted her to. Oh Lolita was more than willing to give herself up to Mr.Cue, but he turned out to be quite impotent, and preferred to take his pleasure in watching pubescent children indulge in carnal endeavors. When Lolita refused to participate in her destined “role”, he threw her out of the house where they had retreated, and Lolita was left to fend for herself.It is in her favor to discover, that instead of going back to Humbert, she chose to live on her own, struggling and working hard, but independent. She found herself a husband, a simple, earnest, honest, and hopelessly poor fellow, from whom she came to expect a child, and finally giving in to the economical strain of her living, decided to contact Humbert, and ask him for help. After getting thoroughly denied, Humbert left her all the money that in truth was hers, which came from the rent obtained by the tenants of her mother’s house, he informed her of the state of her inheritance, and left her finally free to do what she wished with her life.At least Humbert didn’t cheat her on this subject, but then again he had no interest in anything anymore, he was driven by one sole purpose. Armed with a tiny Colt, his objective was simple, he had to blame someone for his loss (certainly not himself), and avenge it somehow. And here the book barrels into its fitting drawn-out absurd ending. (hide spoiler)]The Characters:Humbert: Ah, our main character, our unrepentant “sinner” who applies to us, the readers, for understanding, but not forgiveness. So little development, so “set in stone”, so very hard to empathize with. One can “understand” him to a certain degree, but nothing in the story makes him even remotely redeemable, or likable. He’s a detail freak, obsessive, fanciful, paranoid, and attracted to little girls.Lolita: Our heroine, of course, the book can only show her in the distorted version perceived by Humbert which is not a very flattering perspective. Oh Humbert worships her immensely, don’t get me wrong, but he depicts her in a way that seems to imply her inviting and craving his attentions, which makes her nearly as unlikable and disturbing as Humbert himself. Oh she had a crush on an older man, certainly, but what girl child doesn’t? That doesn’t justify grown men lusting after them. And while leaving Humbert didn’t quite work out the way she expected, she still preferred to set herself lose from the shackles imposed on her by fate, and that makes her quite a great character. Her depiction was relatively realistic (in spite of the grotesque vision of Humbert) in the exposure of her young teenager behavior, her moodiness and her resentment. The tragedy of her life was being born to a mother that despised her, and falling in the path of dangerous men.Clare Quilty: A playwright and Lolita’s true object of desire, a character even worse than Humbert himself, a feat quite hard to achieve indeed. Shameless, entitled, careless, callous, a smooth talker, so used to having people around him, he’s indifferent to them all. He had no qualms at the prospect of getting rid of Lolita, nor any regrets over his behavior.Charlotte Haze: Lolita’s mother. Her behavior towards her daughter was ambiguous and confusing. In Humbert’s twisted view, she seems to struggle between her instinctive female jealousy of Humbert’s attention, and her wish to educate her daughter properly.Final thoughts:I hated this book when I started reading it, I hated it when I was midway, I hated it when I started writing this post, and I still hate it now that I have finished both the post and the book. It can be a “classic” all you want, but it’s still a ridiculously boring book, there was so much nonsense of little to no consequence, meant only to desensitize the reader towards the absurdity of the story. I still firmly believe that people never really read it properly.This post has almost 3000 words, I hated this so much I spent a lot of time writing about it…I just needed to release all the venom that was trapped in my head while I was reading.This book was so terrible I had to roll my eyes often to check if my brain cells were still there, I’m pretty sure I lost a couple…(This was taken almost word by word from my blog about this book :P)"
4,aol,685,684,"I honestly don't know how to feel about this book...I wanted to get my hands on 
Lolita
 for a very long time. I waited so long to experience the beauty of the writing style this book claimed to possess. Unfortunately, disappointment hit me hard on this one.I feel betrayed and kind of glad that I did not waste my money on buying this book but rather choosing to borrow it from a good friend of mine, but nevertheless... Betrayal is still crawling upon my emotions and feelings. I honestly thought my reading experience with 
Lolita
 would be the unforgettable sort, only to wake up to the reality that this book is nothing but empty pages colored with a disturbing concept.To be completely fair and honest, the writing style is very beautiful and unique. The concept of the book is not! For those of you who are not aware of what 
Lolita
 narrates: It's a novel about a middle-aged college professor falling in love with a 12 years old child and rapes her.:\ I couldn't get to the ending. "
4,Jackie,686,685,"First of all, I read this book because it was on a list of the 100 Greatest Novels of the 20th Century. I knew that the subject matter would be hard for me to get through since I teach middle school and have a daughter of my own, but I figured that reading this would probably be a good challenge for me.I understand that Nabokov usually writes from the perspective of unsavory characters and Humbert Humbert is exactly that. The language of the book was very well written and I loved the descriptions of mid-century America, but it was all I could do to get through his descriptions of Lolita and his other ""nymphets."" There was more than one occasion where I put down the book after reading only a paragraph or two, because I would feel so angry that I didn't think that I could lend my concentration to the words on the page. It was sickening to be in the head of this pervert.The book makes it sound as if Lolita seduced Humbert and the reader is supposed to be shocked at just how much control she has over him, and shocked at how she knows it and uses it to her advantage. HELLO!!! She's a 12-year old girl. Anybody who has spent any amount of time around 12 to 14-year olds will tell you that there is a lot of hormonal stuff going on there. However, they are not adults with adult minds; they are children and their minds and personalities are still developing. It is within their nature to push boundaries and, yes, at times, to act provocatively. This does not make them sexual beings or ""nymphets."" The whole idea is disgusting. It makes me furious when I watch the news and hear about another teacher having inappropriate relations with a student. Even more so when the teacher says that they are in love with the student or that they were ""seduced"" by the student. It's just stupid! In order to fall in love with someone or to be seduced by someone, you must first be on the same level as that person. If one is above the other in rank somehow something just seems ""not right"" about that relationship. Adults are done developing, both in mind and body, and to take advantage of a young person just discovering who they are, deserves a special place in hell. Lolita is supposed to symolize America and Humbert is Europe. I got that from the book, but I didn't really get anything else from this symbolism. I just felt like that was something the author put in there to give this book some intellectual credence.In the end, Lolita does leave Humbert, though it is for another arrangement which is just as bad for her, and he goes three years never being able to track her down. She eventually marries and gets pregnant at 17 to a young man who is, at least, closer to her own age than Humbert. Humbert also eventually tracks down the man who he considers to have ""kidnapped"" his Lolita and kills him; and from the way that the book is narrated he appears to have ended up in prison. However, I was personally hoping for a castration-by-Bowie-knife ending. Maybe I just couldn't overcome my own disgust at the subject matter and I have totally missed the mark on this book. I don't know. All I know is that any man remotely resembling Humbert Humbert in thoughts and behaviors who comes near my daughter will get stabbed in the eyes with whatever I have handy."
4,Myke,695,694,"I gave this one a shot, but really, no matter how well it was written, or what point he was going for, i had to put it down after about 200 pages. It's possible that there is some grandness to the novel which only comes with finishing it, but i just couldn't read about anymore pedophelia. I couldn't take this book BEFORE i had a daughter, now just thinking about it makes me mad."
4,Dana West,704,703,"Great writing. Horrible subject matter. Anyone saying that this is a ""love story"" must be delusional like HH. This is a story about lust and greed, period.I've read many classics, it seems to be that this one is a classic by default. It is not obscene, it is not pornographic, but it does make me uneasy. Any abuser justifies their actions like HH. He trapped her, he used her, he was ready to put her aside until he realized that she wasn't his alone. What a douche. Favorite line: Lolita speaking to HH ""He broke my heart, you broke my life"" (or something like that)."

4,Dark-Draco,714,713,"As this is on the list of 1001 books you must read before you die, I was expecting great things. Unfortunatley, I just couldn't get into it. Although the subject matter is, obviously, disturbing, this wasn't actually what put me off. I just found the 'diary' entries very self-indulgent and, to be frank, boring! They also tell you how the story ends, so I decided it wasn't worth persuing when I have such a large number of books still to read."
4,Whitney,716,715,"Reading this book was like ordering a classic cocktail whose name is instantly familiar and loaded with cultural connotation, but which you have never before tasted. And when you finally try it, it's kind of gross. You wonder how on earth it ever attained the significance that people now attach to it, or how people can order it on a regular basis without referring to its extreme bitterness (even if, for some the bitterness is part of the pleasure). And you are able to think, ""Now this is part of my cultural context...but I never need to order it again.""This is not to say that there are not passages of wonderful imagery or that the work is not clearly that of an author at an advanced stage of intellectual sophistication. However, the topic is so poisonous as to overshadow whatever literary merit might otherwise be gleaned from it. I decided to read this book after the background of reading both Stacy Schiff's biography of Vera Nabokov and an earlier VN novel, ""The Gift."" Now I feel no need to go further into the Nabokov oeuvre."

4,Zeke,731,730,"Oh man, this guys name was humbert humbert. I want to say that I completely understand Humbert's preference, however I didn't find the guy to honestly be such an intellectual, but more of a person who is simply mixed up about his choice in women. A more normal person in his situation would marry a women that could make him feel loved, and masturbate to child porn in secrecy like an actual person, but there is not a single nymphet in the world that would actually be like any of the ones in this book. If you haven't actually met any five year olds yet, they are very small, very stupid, and they make fart noises for fun. They won't find anything attractive except for butterflies because they have no sexual urges. In fact had anyone met Humbert in real life, they'd probably just try to stay away from him, because most people don't put that kind of attention in women of that age. The book isn't bad it's jus- wait. Yes it it.I didn't finish it :)"
4,Diedra,737,736,A narcissistic exercise of felony crime that parades about as literature. The objectification of Delores by Nabokov serves as a reminder that the victims in all such crimes are still silenced. I cannot believe that this piece of literary pornography remains on the list of top 100 novels of the 20th century. 
4,Deborah,748,747, The (admittedly well-written) ramblings of a pedophile. I couldn't finish this book purely for moral reasons.

If it did I never made it that far.

I CANNOT get over the reviews that I have been reading talking about eloquent prose...really, people? Is everyone else able to get past the fact that this protagonist is a sick, pedophile???? Maybe it's just me but every time he called her his ""nymphette"" I was revolted. The best part was the end, maybe he should have done that sooner and he could have saved ""his Lolita"" a life of therapy. Not worth the read."

4,Gwen Haaland,790,789,"My Book Discussion Group picked this one. It was one of my least favorite books due to the disturbing content, immorality of the main character and child abuse. Unfortunately I could not get beyond that enough to enjoy the authors beautiful writing style. "
4,Patrick,791,790,"The way that Nabokov portrays Humbert is that he feigns weakness although he is the perpetrator of the crime.The character Humbert Humbert is a perverted child molester that I have a hard time indentifying with. The only reason he likes Dolores Haze is because she is pubescent not because of her innate qualities although later on in the book he claims he loves her. At least in the movie The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Benjamin and Daisy inequality of external age is redeemed by the fact that they are soulmates. Be that as it may, Dolores Haze is a sexually precocious teen who seems eager to experiment with sex especially with an older man. But to Dolores it seems that she just wanted to experiment, she was not expecting to get in a relationship with him.Even taking into account Dolores Haze's sexual precociousness, Humbert's mind is utterly disgusting because he willed this dalliance into taking place. Despite playing the victim in the novel, it was he who married Charlotte Haze so he could get to Dolores; it was he who wanted Charlotte Haze dead and after she died, he was happy and made a plans to kidnap Dolores Haze. Also, he takes advantage of the fact that he is the guardian of Dolores and the only one she can trusts for his own sexual pleasure. Their relationship reminds me of a pimp and his prostitute with stick (threats of the ""horrible"" CPS) and carrots ( buying her stuff and taking her places); thus it takes a tone of an abusive relationship.As the novel progresses, I feel good that Humbert is becoming paranoid and clingy toward Dolores. Karma finally bites him in the ass.I think that the good thing about this book is that it shows that a guy in his 40's and a teen do not work in a relationship because their interests are too different. Although Humbert likes to keep Dolores as his sex slave the longer they are together the more he has to be her caretaker/guardian. As the book progresses, Humbert and Dolores relationship really takes on a fucked up protector/protectee form. That is Humbert although he is lustfully hurting Dolores, genuinely loves her and protects her from the other man who molest her. For her part, Dolores despite running away seeks Humbets monetary help. Although it does not excuse the horrible act that child molester perform, this book does show the complex relationship between a child molester and the child (the child molester being the aggressor and the protector).This book begs to question: ""what happens to sexually abused children?"" Are their future reltionship dictated by the past of being in an abusive relationship with their father figure?"" and ""How can we help child molestors not lust after children (b/c as this book points out, Humbert does realize he is doing something wrong to Dolores just he cannot stop him from wanting to have interecourse with her)?"
4,Tulika,792,791,"The book made me sick. I know that is probably the whole point, and that I should appreciate Nabokov's genius in his effort at getting into the psyche of a pedophile, etc., I couldn't. Not a single line in the book was humour for me, nor did I for the faintest moment sympathize with Humbert. May be I feel too strongly on these topics, but I wouldn't ever recommend this book to anyone. In my view, the most overrated book of all time."
4,Jo Jeffery,801,800," Horrendous and disturbing not at all subversive in its humour just a picture of a paedophile that evokes no sympathy for himself and its victim - apart from ""she lies sobbing at night"" and ""oh no not again!"""
4,Sadiq sagheer,802,801,"I didn't enjoy Lolita, several times I was tempted to put down the book. Though some of the writing/prose was somewhat compelling, I didn't need to delve into the sexual domination, manipulations of the protagonist.I know people out there think this is some sort of masterpiece, but I'm not one of them. I got the concept because it really wasn't that deep, but talk about boring. Two times going on trips and each just as dull as the other. Staying at the same type of sleazy hotels, motels, etc. It just seemed to ramble on and on and at times, virtually said nothing new. The best part was the ending."
4,Alejandra,804,803,"Lolita is a story about a man who is infatuated with a child.I guess I'm one of the ignorant people that doesn't get the ""beauty"" of this book. I found the pedophilia to be revolting. I'm horribly confused as to why so many people live this book so much. I won't dog you if you loved it, but I hated it and it made me sick.I read that Vladimir likes to write his stories from the point of view of a detestable character and then lead them to failure but I can't get past this one. What you're supposed to do is hate Humbert, and you're supposed to read all the way to the end where everything crashes down. It's so horrible the way he talks about the little girl, though. Too real for me. Too twisted for me. I can't see how anyone can make it all the way to the end to find out about his demise.I wish I could give it negative stars. It was that bad. But I gave it 1 out of 5 stars because that wasn't an option."

4,Terynce,814,813,"No. No, no, no. I've no idea how this book has endured for as long as it has. I am at a loss trying to explain or understand it. Deeply disturbing.

Amidst the skin crawling creepiness, I admit, I did laugh out loud once. It was when (view spoiler)[Humbert and Lolita were in the hotel room and he's trying to explain that he's just a concerned father figure and that while traveling they may end up... he's at a loss for words at this point, but she quickly supplies one, ""incest.""

All of the reviewers I follow gave this book high ratings. Thousands of Goodreads members sang its’ praises. It made it into the top 100 works of 20th century fiction. So, it has to be me. I am struggling to understand why this is considered to be “classic” literature. Highly overrated in my opinion.This review is dedicated to my new friend DJ ☺"

I can't even force myself to the finish line. I find the main character desperately dull and Lolita too. I just couldn't care less about either of them. HH is thoroughly unlikeable and not just because he is a paedophile. His narration of the story just makes me want to throw up my last meal. Both are one dimensional characters and the plot I found so boring I was just skim reading pages.Maybe it gets better but I may get hit by a bus tomorrow and life's too short to invest anymore time in this.I'm sorry literature, I've clearly failed you as this is a supposed masterpiece to the rest of the world, but not to me.Oh and I never want to hear or read the word nymphette again for as long as I live.

4,Tia Katrina Canlas,892,891,"To be good, character-driven novels need characters in them that are either (a) interestingly relatable to the reader, (b) uniquely interesting, (c) or both.Definitions and Examples:a) Interestingly relatable: Characters that are interestingly relatable have qualities about them that are not specifically extraordinary but are qualities that appeal to the reader by evoking a sense of familiarity and empathy. They are the types of characters that remind you of your friend, your mom, your son, or even your worst enemy, in a very personal way; they are the types of characters that remind you of yourself when you were younger, or the part of yourself that you are proud of, or the part of yourself that embarrasses you. Such characters keep the reader intensely invested in the story’s upcoming downfalls, triumphs, developments, and conclusions.For example, Jonathan Safran Foer’s Oskar (from Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close) is a nine-year-old multilingual, academic, pacifistic, and musical vegan raised in the information age of New York and tragically affected by 9-11; this makes Oskar a character to whom I can relate in an interesting way.b) Uniquely interesting: Characters that are uniquely interesting (unlike the first category of characters that are interesting in the similarities they share with the reader) are interesting because of the unique qualities about them that make them stand out as an individual. The reader lives vicariously through these types of characters.For example, the carefree quirkiness and all-embracing creativity of Andre Breton’s character Nadja is interesting in a unique way.c) Both: And then, there is Superman who is uniquely interesting in that he is an alien from another planet but also relatable to the reader in that his human life is very average in terms of social status, romantic preferences, and creative achievements; what makes Clark Kent interesting is that he leads an average life even though he has superpowers.Lolita:Nobody I know reminds me of the psychopathic narrator or the bratty, apparently seductive, protagonist. As for myself, since I’m (luckily) neither a pedophile nor a nymphet, I cannot in any way relate to Humbert Humbert or Dolores Haze. Hence, for me to have liked ""Lolita"" would entail Nabokov’s depiction of characters that are unique.At first I thought that maybe working in a group home where many of the kids were molested by their stepparents made me jaded; maybe my career normalized pedophilia for me in a way that minimized the story’s affect on me.However, I realized that Nabokov made Lolita’s main characters uninteresting by illustrating other characters just like them. Throughout the book, Humbert Humbert tries to make us believe that he is obsessed with Lolita but still makes sure to tell us that there’s another nymphet here and there and everywhere. Towards the end of the book, we learn about other nymphets that are molested in pornographic orgies. This makes Lolita un-unique and diminishes the tragedy of her lost childhood; also, she’s a brat just like any other kid (but not in a way that reminds the reader of a daughter, or niece, or cousin).Humbert Humbert’s love for Lolita isn’t uniquely interesting either. Clare Quilty is introduced as another man just like Humbert Humbert who wants to fuck Lolita, but in an even creepier way. He has parties, and friends, and pornography.Now that I think about it… I would much rather have read a book that started with Clare Quilty kidnapping Lolita and ended with the brat being kicked out of his place since she would not participate in his attempts at producing kiddie-porn. At least Clare Quilty is a semi-successful playwright with a gregarious personality that attracts multiple sexual partners and fans. He is outspoken and funny, sarcastic and witty. The only thing Humbert Humbert had going for him was his good looks.Unfortunately, Nabokov saved the uniquely interesting Clare Quilty for the end and tortured me with hundreds of pages of Humbert Humbert trying to think of a hundred ways to bribe Lolita into secretly giving him sexual favors.There are many shocking and uncomfortable themes that writers can play with but characterization is very important. Lolita and Humbert Humbert fail as characters in a shocking and uncomfortable relationship.Furthermore, “Lolita” should not be given so much credit just because Nabokov is ESL."
4,Julia Slagle,893,892,Awful book!
4,Marc Udoff,895,894,Way too wordy and boring. I stopped half way though because I needed a dictionary and an infinite amount of time to want to finish
4,Sharon L,902,901,"i love Nabokov writing style- it's amazing, so beautifull and the only reason why i was able to read the book. For that I should give it a 5 stars. the thing is- The story is aweful, and after seeing so many ravishing reviews I can't bring myself to give it 5 stars when the content is what it is. yes, a story doesn't have to be good (talking about good MC and heroic story), the main character dowsn't have to be likeable. many times more, a story should make you feel shivers, cold, to open your eyes to some sort of reality you prefered not to see. A great author would use a story to challenge your beliefes, and Nabokov achieved all that and more. and yet, I can't bring myself to give it 5 stars because despite all it's QUALITY (that I state each and every time I speak with someone on the book) I need to show that I wasn't fooled. and that for Dolores it was an expirence that destroyed her life, I need to show that I'm aware. and that 1 star represent exactly that for me.I hated the story, the self justified humbert that at first hides the monster he is. the way he tried to describe his sick attraction to Dolores as love i felt chills. i wasn't fooled. when he described Dolores and him as a happy couple, pretending she had the power in their relationship. i wasn't fooled. i wanted to know how she felt. her contempt was clear, the fact that she was scared, was clear. Nabokov really is a genius creating a charcter like humbert, that's able to fool many pepole including himself- with sobs and pity stories, regrets, self justification, and blaming- as if it was she that tempted him! i cried, hurt and was scared for Dolores. i remember how horrified i was when he played with thought of getting her pregnent so she could give birth to a new Lolita for him. i hate this books, it makes me cold, afraid, sending chills of disgust. but the writing, oh, the writing...it's glorious. and Nabokov is a master at deception, humbert is so vivid, so real, it's terrifing."
4,Christina Daley,908,907,"Hated this. And not surprisingly, I had to read it for a class in college. I have this book even mentioned here so that I can say how much I despise it. I would prefer root canal than have to read this again."
4,Sarah Actually,909,908,It's beautifully written but I can't. I just can't. Why.
4,Josiah Harrist,914,913,"Absolutely disgusting, but masterfully written. I will never read this book again, and as someone with a sister the age of the girls that are preyed upon in the book, I find the subject matter absolutely gruesome. Too far, Nabokov, too far. "
4,cyndi,916,915,"The author did a fantastic job of playing broader and deeper English language unnecessary to narrate a pedophilic story. And people naturally choose if it's their best read or their worst. Unfortunately, i'm on the negative side. It took me 5 days and so to read and grasp it and hoped i didn't caught interest in reading this before those days. I had some classes before regarding sexual preferences and this story of pedophilia is under the category of psychosexual disorder not limited to a sexual disorder.I was open minded reading this but it bores me in many ways. And all i did was.. shake my head.;)Note: 2014I'm okay with the pedophilia plot but it doesn't have any charm associated with it. The intensity maybe was dragged by too much wordplay."

4,Eugene Yu,923,922,"i wanted to like this book, but it did not blew me away, the premise of the story started out very intriguing and sensual...LOLITA, the light of my life, the fire of my loins, an excited and seasoned reader would like to dig into this right away, but there were problems with construction of words, and the plot was a little topsy turvy in my opinion, and there were a lot of typographical errors which i find irritating, maybe a really bad ebook copy , anyway i might get a physical copy of this book and try to dissect and compare it with the ebook version, because everybody in the book community is raving about this modern classic which i find a litte disappointing to read. "
4,Deanna,930,929,"I am marking this as read, though I only made to chapter 5. I assume it is because I have an 11 year old daughter of my own, but I cannot take anymore of this book. I can appreciate the literary language used, but the plot is unacceptable to me. I appreciated the ""warning on the back"" and I thought I would be fine. Not the case. "
4,Jenren,931,930,"I know I'm sacrilegious for not fawning over this book, but it makes me nauseous."
4,Cristina Urse,938,937,"I finished it because I was curious to see what happens to Lolita, but the book itself was disturbing. Maybe it would have been easier to read it when I was a little younger, but I doubt it. I will never see the movie!!!"
4,Christina White,943,942,"I made it to page 30. Beautiful writing. Disgusting topic. I can't read it. As a child I was abused and this book makes me feel 9 years old again. I am completely disgusted. I can't believe so many people have rated this book highly. I can see that the author has some skill, but I can't get over the subject... I am so upset by it. Who would want to read this? Who wants to read about a man getting turned on by little girls? Who wants to read the detailed descriptions he puts in about their growing public hair and growing nipple nubs??????!!!!!!!!!!!0 stars."
4,Readingroo,952,951,Could not get through this book - I tried but the subject matter made it impossible.
4,Eleise,957,956,"I know this is a classic. Why can't I like this book, try as I might?"
4,Léah,965,964,"I admire Nabokov's bravery in writing a book about the mind of a paedophile, but I got half way through and simply couldn't read it any further due to feeling totally sick. This, on one hand, shows the great artistic brilliance of Nabokov, but, on the other, it shows such a book is not made for everyone."
4,Mobrien55,967,966,"Knew was a""classic"". So I was into reading that type of book trying to ""broaden my horizons"". Couldn't get passed the first paragraph. When I realised what the subject matter was about I felt icky even getting it from the library and having someone know I took it out."
4,Liana,971,970,No book has ever tortured me this much and no one will ever make me understand why it is considered a masterpiece. 
4,Jared Hempel,975,974,"This read was a necessary lesson in both the valuing of my own intuition and the dialing-down of reverence for ""the hype"".I'd seen this book plastered all over ""Best of"" lists—pushed as the pinnacle of aesthetic writing, a classic of classics, “The only convincing love story of our time”. Hah. After about an entire week of slogging through its 317 pages of numbingly digressive, tediously cryptic, and purposeless prose, I am honestly shocked that anyone could hold this work in high regard.Now, I've read a decent amount of reviews and there seem to be two main points of validation:1) ""The 'Unreliable Narrator' is perfectly embodied to the point that the reader will sympathize with the main character, a pedophile.""Haha, no. A tragic backstory can only seek to explain, never excuse. The very notion of having sympathy towards a character that ultimately enslaves, rapes, and siphons the life from a 12-year old girl is simply unfathomable to me. 2) ""L'écriture! C'est magnifique, un chef-d'œuvre!""Sure? I can admit that Nabokov's grasp of the English language was, at times, absolutely mesmerizing. However, when it is spent, for the vast majority of the book, drowned in the sickeningly-obsessive, lusting mind of a 38 year-old pedophile, it all falls apart for me. All-in-all, if you align with the idea, contrary to Nabokov, that fiction can contain both aesthetic AND cerebral content, then I would recommend avoiding this book entirely. There is nothing offered other than an irredeemably dark portrait of a pedophile, clever wordplay, and weightless words. Do not be fooled by the ""established"" critics like I was. There are so many better books to read, from actually-engaged minds."
4,Lylanie,977,976,Worst book ever
4,Kasey,978,977,"I don't understand why I was forced to read this book in school. Modern Political Theory was the class. What pedophilia and modern political theory have in common is beyond me. It may be a classic, but I truly hated this book. Life is too short to waste it on fictitious trash. I really felt it was like reading Jerry Springer."
4,David Ochs,985,984,"Couldn't even make myself finish it. It was sort of interesting how he made me identify with this terrible person, but that novelty wore off in about 100 pages. Then there were 300 more pages of not much going on. This is probably quality literature, but I didn't enjoy it much."

4,Tera,1010,1009,"If I could I would give this a negative rating. I despised this book. I despised the characters. I despised the repetitive language ""blah blah blah nymphette"". I despised any reasoning that would make this a ""classic"". I even despised the author's notes on the book in the back. Hated it."
4,Margaret Baratta,1013,1012,"Honestly-I don't care who thinks this book is brilliant or blah blah, Nabokov may be a great writer but to read that type of description about a young girl is morbidly disgusting. I had to read this book for class, and with its reputation I might have read it without being forced to. But now that I know that everyone who boasts about this book has never actually read it, that it's not about a young prostitute or young love but a young girl who is tricked, seduced, raped, and ruined by a middle aged monster. While the literary merit of this novel could possibly be argued if you take emotion out of the reading, it is quite impossible for me to do so because in order to read fiction one must attach emotion. It's just too disgusting, as a female, to read this because even if it is fiction, this sick fuck Nabokov did come up with it, even if it's just fantasy aren't we as readers given the right to say your fantasy is sick and twisted?The back cover gives a quote from Vanity Fair as ""the only convincing love story of our century."" Well, we know whoever wrote this at Vanity Fair is to some degree a pedophile and has no concept of love.If this is America's version of a love story no wonder this country is so dense and going to hell."
4,Kelly Cochran,1015,1014,"I just couldn't get past the fact that this book is written from the POV of a pedophile. Couldn't finish it, regardless of its status as a ""classic."" YUCK. "
4,Sezín Koehler,1017,1016,"I do not understand how anyone could think a story of pedophilia is great literature. It's offensive and sick that a middle-aged man convinces himself a child is flirting and even initiates a sexual relationship with him. I have no idea how this novel has become considered a ""classic."" There is nothing classic about the sexual abuse of children."
4,Kim Cannon,1018,1017,Could NOT finish this book.......I could not get into a man who loved young children!!!! Disgusting!!!
4,Julianne,1026,1025,I'm going to withhold my rating on this one for a bit. I know it's a classic but it's also rather disturbing.

4,Anne Freya,1038,1037,"Melihat cover barunya yg dipamerin Serambi, jadi teringat kalau buku yg satu ini blm kutambahkan dlm Goodreads. Dibaca bertahun-tahun yg lalu, cukup kesulitan menyelesaikannya waktu itu krn alur ceritanya membosankan. "
4,Ashley (mac&chip),1040,1039,"I freaking hated this book, especially the audio version – blah, blah, blah. It was boring, snotty and annoying. The sad thing is that I really wanted to like this book. I find the entire May-December relationship thing really fascinating, and have read many books on the topic, but I just couldn't do this one."
4,Kavity,1041,1040,"It was a painful affair, a horridly painful affair, reading about Humbert Humbert's fantasies of nymphets and his particularly perennial obsession with Lolita. And, therein, perhaps, lies the writer's victory - in having been able to depict in torrid imagery, the vulgarities of the protagonist's thoughts. As to those readers who have, over the years, interpreted this story as one of twelve year old Lo bewitching this old ass Humbert, I can only ask you to go back and read the book again, keeping in mind that Lo was ""twelve years old"" when this happened. As for me, I truly believe this book was not only a waste of my time, but also a drain on my mental capacities. And I can only attribute completing this book to my own obsession to not leaving books unfinished. Agreed that it is very well written prose, but the mental strain of reading something bordering on porn is a huge price to pay for very well written prose."
4,Marisa Whitaker,1045,1044,I'm trying to go back and read some classic novels. I tried to find any merit in this book. Instead I am disgusted in several levels. 
4,Ann Tracy,1047,1046,"Meh... Even less impressed with this book the second time around. Granted I'm going through a lot in my life right now so the subject matter was probably too heavy for me right now.I'm not sure if it's the subject matter that turns me off or the writing style. Perhaps I could muster through the subject matter if I loved his writing. But I don't. He just seems a bit full of himself. (That'd be the writer AND the main character, take your pick.)So shoot me, I don't like this book considered an American Classic - although why it's considered that I'm cluess as it's not that great and he isn't American."
4,Carlie,1050,1049,"Because it is written from the pedophile's point of view, I hated this book. When I read, I often identify with one of the main characters. It was impossible to do so wih this one. Everyone is mentally disturbed. If you have a high sense of morality and justice, trust me, this book will make you feel like you jumped headfirst into a latrine."

4,Ginny,1066,1065,"I did not enjoy reading Lolita. Let me clarify. There were parts I liked, and I appreciate this book and respect Nabokov's writing style. I will definitely read more of his work and maybe even reread this someday... eh probably not. I like the premise of Humbert addressing his readers as his jury, but as his jury I absolutely loath him and couldn't enjoy his beautiful language or whatever. He was too vile a narrator to let myself get swept away in his tale of ""love"". I dragged my feet through this novel but will enjoy the future discussions I have with others who have also read Lolita."
4,Prinny White,1067,1066,"Many people have recommended this book to me. ""It's written from the perspective of a pedophile, but he's not the hero. The reason you read this book is not to sympathize with Humbert Humbert; it is for the sheer delight of reading Nabokov's prose.""I decided to give it a try. I love a beautifully written book, and can appreciate a morally ambiguous character. Sometimes, they're the most fun.Two pages in, I closed the book again, disgusted. ""Nope,"" I thought. ""It's still about a pedophile."""

I really don't understand why a book about pedophilia and utterly destroying a young girls life is considered to be such an amazing classic...WTFE I had an ebook of Lolita and promptly erased that bitch the minute I finally finished it, I can't remember the last time I wanted a book to end so badly. "
4,Elle,1101,1100,"This book disturbs me so much more this time around than when I read it in high school. Its rating is based on my emotional response to it, not Nabokov's craftsmanship, which remains diabolically clever. Nabokov employs vivid language to bring to life the narrator's lust for 12-yr-old Lolita, detailing how he first plots, plans and steals his pleasure, then how he becomes her guardian and ""has"" her. It reveals offhandedly the ways he subjugates her, making her earn ""the hard and nauseous way"" every treat her heart desires, the endless presents with which he tries to buy her love and cooperation--in essence the whole twisted and ultimately unsatisfying nature of his love and his dawning realization of what his love has done to her. The role of consumerism and the material struck me in their role as context, attempted bargain in exchange for her innocence and in the very culture's culpability in commodifying her sexuality from that young age. ""One day I removed from the car and destroyed an accumulation of teen-magazines. You know the sort. Stone Age at heart, up to date, at least Mycenan, as to hygiene."" Nabokov suggests the culture itself taught Lolita, little Dolores Haze, the role she was given as commodity, as property, as mirage and as dupe. ""She believed with a kind of celestial trust, any advertisement or advice that appeared in Movie Love or Screen Land.... The words 'novelties and souvenirs' simply entranced her by their trochaic lilt.... She it was to whom ads were dedicated: the ideal consumer, the subject and object of every foul poster."" The book's point-of-view puts the reader in the place of the pedophile and the consumer, asking us to see the world and Lolita through his eyes, making us voyeurs complicit in treating her as object and challenging us to feel sympathy for the predator as much as for his prey. In this manner, it's as courageous an undertaking as it is an uncomfortable one, even if one gets the sense that Nabokov is toying with us as Humbert toys with Lolita. "

4,Kris - My Novelesque Life,1118,1117,"1 STARS""Lolita is a novel by Vladimir Nabokov, written in English & published in 1955 in Paris, in 1958 in NY & in 1959 in London. It was later translated by its Russian-native author into Russian. The novel is notable for its controversial subject: the protagonist & unreliable narrator, a 37–38-year-old literature professor, Humbert Humbert, is obsessed with the 12-year-old Dolores Haze, with whom he becomes sexually involved after he becomes her stepfather. ""Lolita"" is his private nickname for Dolores."" (From Amazon)I know it is supposed to be a classic and while it is well-written I did not care for the characters or the story."
4,Yasmine Alfouzan,1126,1125,"I was going to be mature about this, you know. “Maybe I shouldn’t give it just one star. I mean, it’s very well-written, isn’t it? It’s not the worst book in the world. It’s not 50 Shades of Grey. It’s… literature.” No.I cannot imagine the last time I felt such despise towards a book. The Stand by Stephen King comes to mind, but that book was over 1200 pages long. You can’t blame me there. This book was so bland, that I questioned my love for reading. With such topic, I find it hard to believe, how can it be anything BUT interesting? Color me surprised. This novel is only about 350 pages long, and all I could think about was: when will this one-dimensional drivel be over? I get it. We are reading about an obsession. But this book is so monotone. So repetitive. It was not interesting. It lacked depth. It lacked revelations. Details. Nothing about it was controversial. In this day and age, nothing about this book surprised me or really changed my view about anything in life. Excuse me for not finding (wonderfully well-written) descriptions of how delectable 12 year olds are, something of great interest to me and my life. All in all, I’m glad I read it, just so I know exactly what to say whenever someone tells me that they thought Lolita is a work of art and one of the greatest books ever written. "

4,Abice07,1138,1137,"I'm not sure how V. Nabokov style of writing granted this book so much fame. Personally I felt this story quite sicking and I'm not sure how you could view it any other way. Simply it's about a self absorbed pedophile, the things he does to his step daughter, and how he rationalizes his disgusting actions and borderline brainwashing. I couldn't get past the pedophilia in this book, maybe some people can? "
4,Clare,1139,1138,"This book has caused more controversy in my book club than most! It is a hard read for a mother with daughters but in its defence it is beautifully written and in his 3rd language to boot! Some of the members of my book club have decided not to read more than the first 14 chapters as they think it is morally shocking but there is pathos, humour and wonderful literature if you can get past the subject matter! "
4,Parvati,1147,1146,"I just wanted to throw up the whole time I read this book. I don't care how well you write, I don't wanna read about pedophilia. Makes me sicl=k."
4,Yasmin M,1148,1147,What in the name of fuck?.. I don't even..
4,Cora,1154,1153,"Okay, so apparently this book is a classic and all, but I must admit I struggled to complete it. This was the first book chosen for my newly formed bookclub; I'm surprised that anyone showed up to the next meeting.Apart from the pedophilia bordering incestuous story line, the book was just plain hard to read. Paragraph after paragraph describing every detail to it's simplest form. The other major turn off about this story is the narrators narcissism; several times throughout the story the Humbert Humbert addressed the reader outside the storyline to discuss his effect on the ladies. It was a reach for me to identify with the main character on any level. Bouts of mental illness that the narrator/main character experienced throughout the book made it difficult for me to decipher reality from his delusions. You can imagine how this element contributed to the readability of this story. In conclusion: a slow, perverted, hard to read fictional story meant to be read as a memoire by a pedophiliac narcissist. The end. "

4,Azra,1158,1157,"The writer knows his job, his thoughts and sayings are very good and he knows how to represent bad and unlogical things in his favour but I just couldnt deal with the fact that he is somehow sexually harassing 12 year old girl, because under all circumstances that's what it is. That was enough for me :)"
4,aRee,1159,1158,"Mungkin karena buku ini sedianya berasal dari jaman yang berbeda dimana kata-katanya amat penuh dengan simbol dan deskripsi hal-hal yang nggak gw pahami, jadilah saya sering melompat-lompat dari halaman ke halaman berikut.Singkat ceritanya...gak paham...apa karena terlalu sastra utk otak dan selera saya yang modern? ;P Entahlah...Pastinya, ada banyak perbincangan mengenai buku ini dengan semua penghargaan yang katanya pernah diterima dan kontroversi yang dia timbulkan. Harapan saya agak tinggi waktu membaca buku ini. Seperti salah satu buku karangan anak bangsa yang membuat saya melihat banyak hal yang saya tidak bisa pahami pada pilihan menjadi penyuka sesama jenis. Yah...menurutku Lolita gak sedikitpun kasi pengaruh seperti itu.Seperti yang saya lihat di salah satu review (Natalie kalo ga salah), dia benar2 mendeskripsikan pemikiran saya. Tidak ada ambigu moral setelah membaca buku ini, kesimpulannya tetap: Humbert 'sakit'. Lolita tidak mencintai Humbert dan yang dia lakukan pada Lolita, terserah dia bilang dia cinta, adalah pemerkosaan. Anak sekecil itu belum mengerti dan dia memanfaatkan itu. Dia menahan Lolita, membatasi pergaulannya dan..kapanpun dia ingin, he just do that to her. Gak peduli dia sakit, gak peduli dia nangis. Mengerikan...dan di review buku dibilang ini adalah salah satu novel terbaik sepanjang masa?? Aduh..."
4,Alyssa Armstrong,1160,1159,Did not finish. Super creepy.
4,Ashlie,1162,1161,"I actually didn't finish Lolita... yes, the writing was beautiful, but it just wasn't my thing. I just felt more and more uncomfortable getting deeper and deeper into that creep's head. I'm all for freedom of speech and there's little I hate more than censorship, so go Nabokov... I'm just not going to read it."
4,Doreen Cenci,1167,1166,"I never stop reading a book even when i hate it. But this book...ugh! I was able to put aside the inappropriate and rather disturbing subject matter, but I found Humbert obsessive to the point of annoyance. There were some times where i felt sympathy for him. He obviously never moved on from losing his first childhood love, Annabel. I loved how Nabokov used Poe's Annabel Leigh poem as his inspiration. Also I enjoyed Nabokov's dark sense of humor especially when Humbert would speak about Charlotte or plan or demise. I really wanted to like this book and even as I type out my review I think maybe I will try to continue. As of now, I am walking away."
4,Sammy Nicholas,1170,1169,"I had to read this for class, and I didn't get passed the second chapter of Part 2. There was a whole bunch of unneeded details or details that got redundant because they had been previously mentioned. So basically the book is about a PEDOPHILE who falls on love with this girl Annabel when he is also a boy, and forever only likes young girls, even though he is no longer a boy. He marries a woman who cheats on him and then divorces, he calls young girls that remind him of Ana nymphet, which are young girls between the ages of 10-14 that are just experiencing the brushes of womanhood. Then he meets Lolita, marries her mom, Charlotte, to stay close to her, and then they travel the U.S. Lolita eventually grows sick of him and runs away, and finally he realizes that his sick perverted self cost Lolita her childhood. It is a long book, and it is pretty hard to get through and the language is confusing. It is not worth the time, and if you have to read it Sparknotes is your best option. The characters were alright, but a lot of them were alike, which I realize is a common theme throughout the book, and it just made the characters all run together. If you have the option, don't read this book, it is awful."
4,Katie Wallbom,1173,1172,"I picked up this book, not really knowing what it was about, but hey it's a ""classic"" and must be good. I hated it. I kept reading, hoping that there would be some point. When I finished, I promptly threw it in the trash. I don't feel bad about it either & I love books.What happens in this book? Older man sleeps with a child, they drive around the country, and she ends up barefoot and pregnant in a hovel. The end."
4,Ludmirska,1178,1177,i hate this book!
4,Nancy Varley,1182,1181,Worst book I have ever finished. Felt compelled to finish just to say I have read it. It was written in an interesting manner but I did not care about any of the characters and the subject matter was awful.

4,Sara floerke,1200,1199,"I picked this up because it is a ""classic"" and I was reading ""Reading Lolita in Tehran"" and felt I needed the background. But this was like sifting through a dumpster from a fast food restaurant in order to find a quarter. Yuck.I didn't miss the point. It's written from the viewpoint of a pedophile. He knows he is evil, he knows this is all wrong, but I decided with a little prodding from the Spirit, that I didn't need to be dragged through all his twisted ideas. Why descend to hell if you don't have to?"
4,Zahra Hassan,1201,1200,"if it deserve a star is for the fluency of the story, other wise its a story of a paedophil trying to gain the world sympathy by convincing them it was the poor Lolita- who was crying for help all over the story - seduced him first and it was for her he became criminal at last.and it gives every paedophilic a reason to continue destroying many childrens life by calling this story ( a classic )"
4,Logan,1202,1201,Adored mostly by stupid internet chicks who seek attention by acting like 5 year olds.
4,Candace Larson,1204,1203,"Although I admit the book was written beautifully, I was never able to get over the subject matter. I generally dislike reading a narrator with zero redeemable qualities. I pushed through because it is on virtually every top 100 books-to-read list and because it came very highly recommended. I was ready to stop 20 pages in and, while it did get easier, I still felt dirty and gross. One critic called this book ""the only convincing love story of our century""--I disagree. It is about obsession, justification, greed, and the dismissal of human decency.I may be considered a prude or perhaps I missed the point of the novel. Regardless, I'm giving this book one star because I disliked reading every page."
4,Mason Thomas,1205,1204,"It took my awhile to write a review on this book because I really needed to digest what it was I had read. I hated this book. I absolutely hated this book. I love books that show man's decent and ultimate fall, but I just couldn't get past the pedophilia part. The description of his deep mental perversion for nymphets was just too much for me to read. It was disgusting, which I guess means the author was successful. I wrote on my American Psycho review that Easton Ellis wrote a book that was gorgeous but grotesque and it wouldn't be right for everyone. That is what Lolita was like for me. I respect the book for what it is but would not recommend it to anyone and would never dream of taking a second look at it."
4,Patricia O'Brien,1208,1207,It's well written but does that make it a good book? Vladimir Nabokov may know how to string words together but the cold hearted misogynistic stories he writes just make me want to throw his books across the room. I was alternately bored and appalled by the intellectual sniveling of Humbert. If I wasn't forced to read Lolita and Pale Fire for a class I wouldn't have bothered with them. What a waste of time. 
4,Mae-Lynn,1210,1209,"I'm into controversial subject matter in books, so I thought I'd love Lolita. Nope. I was bored. I didn't like the writing style. It just wasn't what I expected at all. I couldn't even finish the book. ""The most beautifully written book of all time""? Yeah right! I don't see what all the hype is about. "

4,Greta,1219,1218,"Positive thing I've found about this book was the rich vocabulary and the expressions. A really talented author.Furethemore I was quite disturbed by the context and the similarity of the whole storyline, it was quite a boring read, the only reason I kept going was with the hope it picks up and the vocabulary. I have heard so many good things about this book but it did not fulfill my expectations."
4,Lizzie,1220,1219,"I honestly cannot understand how or why on earth this bizarre book has been labelled as a 'modern classic'. Perhaps I am missing something, but this is one of the most awful books I have ever had to read! The language is far from poetic; it is utterly ridiculous, and the characters are thoroughly unbelievable and unrealistic. "
4,Ann Single,1226,1225,"Nabokov says Lolita tackles one of three American taboos. Personally, I wish he'd used his considerable talent to write about a mixed race marriage or a successful atheist. It's hard to smile along with Humbert when I can hear a child sobbing in the background. I don't buy Humbert's remorse and think the author has a disturbing lack of compassion for Lolita who is not some siren-like creature. She's a little girl who is most horribly abused."

Es prácticamente un viejo lascivo babeando sobre una prepúber. Huácala. Parece que sigue siendo demasiado fuerte para mí.No puedo negar que la pluma de Nabokov es estimulante. El principio del libro... es atrapante. A mí me dejó mal. Pero después sentí verdadero horror. Ya, quizá sigo siendo muy pechoña. Quizá lo intente después, pero por ahora una sola estrella, y no solo por el comportamiento pervertido (jaja), sino que porque, durante lo que alcancé a leer me pareció solamente eso, el retrato de una obsesión... nada más que eso. El largo relato de una obsesión. No hay mayor gracia en eso, me da la impresión. No encontré lecturas secundarias.Lo intentaré de nuevo más adelante. La tercera es la vencida (y si no, filo)."

4,Acer Pseudoplantatus,1291,1290,"My only reason for forcing myself to read Nabokov's Lolita was the recommendation and praise for it by a very good friend of mine, who had made me aware of Julian Barnes (a now favourite writer of mine).Her description had raised high expectations that were disappointed greatly. I wanted to like the book, I tried to like it and I continued to hope for some redeeming qualities while I was reading. But I couldn't. I can't stand it. Not a single bit; not a single aspect of it. And never has a book annoyed me so much.I'll discuss the style  first, since with this book it is style over substance and this style is being praised as beautiful, great and even genius even by many of those giving the book bad reviews. The way I see it, the style is neither; Language-wise, even though there are a few beautiful descriptions, the writing is decorative, hollow, pretentious (incredibly so), self indulgent, weightless in the bad sense, overwrought, smug, self regarding and sterile; a miserable failure at an attempt of being poetic not for artistic reasons but for appearing cultured and erudite. The style of the narrative  is repetitive, rambling, tedious, chaotic (switching between first and third person, in the beginning it was often unclear whom he spoke of) and unreliable (I still cannot understand, why some people seem to be so fond of unreliable narrators). Certainly the ""mastery"" of language displayed (word-plays, literary devices and so on) is impressive (especially when considering that English it is Nabokov's third language),however to me it is mere technical linguistic wanking,meaningless for the most part; eloquent without saying anything. I find neither beauty nor artistic validity or valuable essence in this technical exercise. Content -wise it is the attempt of Humbert Humbert to convince the reader that he, despite having raped a 12-year-old over and over, being a psychopath who degrades and objectifies women and a manipulative murderer he is actually a good guy. And not just a good guy, but a victim of ""demons"" (that disgusting and deluded ""nymphette"" concept as well as stating that he was ""seduced"", despite an failed attempt to drug and rape Dolores), that his objectification and abuse (what I mean here is not just the rape but the abusive relationship; isolation, control and so on) of a child are love and that being a paedophile he is aesthetically ahead of the curve for being able -unlike most men- to identify ""nymphettes"". Oh, and he's oh so tortured. And through all that he is condescending, degrading, often repeating how great he looks, how cultured he is and how he could have any woman. The excessive use of French again seems like an effort to appear cultured; not wanting to communicate any other idea but his own ""greatness"". But wait, it gets worse; he is one of the most flat,one-dimensional characters I've ever encountered. There is noting more to him than narcissism, occasional self-irony (yet not nearly enough to be redeeming in any way) and paedophilia. An abhorrent story presented or should I rather say distorted by an narcissistic psychopath. In conclusion ; I consider Lolita overrated rubbish; .a unjustifiably glorified (well crafted) piece of shit. The only way I can explain to myself that this book has become a classic and is so highly regarded, is that critics love(d) the pretentiousness and shock value and most readers are afraid of being called philistines or prudes. How someone at Vanity Fair can write that it is ""The only convincing love story of our century"" is beyond me; having not read the article I only hope that it was a sarcastic mockery, that the publisher mistook for praise, for it is neither convincing nor in any way about love. "
4,Anja,1293,1292,"DNF at 55%This is a first. I just dnf'd an audiobook. This has never happened before...Why the hell is this a classic? Because some guy said so? Because of the oh so beautiful writing style? Why?No, don't bother. I don't give a flying fig, tbh.This book is just awful. It's boring, tedious, verbose, and pretentious. And the main character is nothing more than a perverted asshole who never owns up to being a perverted asshole. All he does is justifying himself.Ugh. Ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh. Ugh."
4,lafon حمزة نوفل,1297,1296,Amazing writing. Incredibly vivid description. And yet I did not like it. Perhaps this is because I know that I am not secure in my own understanding of the world. Or that I realize that I am not ready to read about parts of humanity (word used loosely) alien to me. At any rate whatever the cause I only reccomend this book to people who know who they are completely and without judgement.

4,Geni,1339,1338,"After all the hype about this book being one of the greatest novels ever and it being required reading for all serious readers, I tried it and found it challenging to even finish. To me it was simply one poor guy's obsession with himself and a girl much too young for him to prey upon. I am most impressed, however, with the intellect and command of languages demonstrated by author Vladimir Nabokov. "
4,Jo,1348,1347,"This was not a good read, good readers."
4,Libby,1350,1349,"OK I want to preface this entry with this statement: I don't usually give up on books before I finish them. In fact I can only remember two books that I chose to not finish reading out of the many thousands I have read in my lifetime. This will be the third. I have failed to complete the book, and for once I really dont care. I have not an ounce of guilt or regret over not finishing it. Why did this book cause such an extreme reaction in me? a) I found Nabokov's writing style flowery and pretentious. In my opinion it was overwritten.b) The parts that were supposed to be comic I found to be only disturbing and nauseating.c) HH's deluded concept of ""nymphettes"" made me cringe with a disgust that I could not overcome.d) HH sad belief that what he was experiencing for Lolita was ""love"" was a laughable concept to me.Perhaps this novel can be called a classic by those who find quality in Nabokov's writing style and who can see layers of depth in such things as metaphors for the old and new worlds of Russia and America. However, I like to call a spade a spade and all academic posturing aside it is quite simply about how a vain and manipulative misogynist paedophile attempts to justify his sickness to the world...and that to me does not classic literature make. It makes my skin crawl to think about how this novel is probably held as a true classic in the paedophile world. "
4,Melinda Flaugher,1351,1350,"I am not sure why this book is recommended as a classic and on book club lists. The writing style was excellent but the content was horrible. In today's society, the author could not write this book without going to jail. "

4,Jonathan Bennett,1393,1392,"An unusual read. The authenticy of this story is ruined by the prelude, which is in the same unusual yet creative style of the rest of the book, yet ""supposedly"" written by other people. I'd read the prelude last if I were you! As for the story, many have said you can sympathise with the character, I however felt I was being manipulated as a reader as much as the writer manipulates his victims, and not once did I feel sympathy. Pity possible, but not sympathy!! The book kind of drifts in and out, the middle is very tedious to read, but the beginning and end are good to read, although I did find myself drifting off occasionally, however when I came back into the story I realised I hadn't missed much!"

4,Jessica Lane,1407,1406,"After looking at other reviews I see that my one star is uncommon but I couldn't stand this book. It wasn't the story, but the writing style. I know that the style is to show how Humbert wants to convince the reader he is a good man and that his feelings for Lolita are real despite her age, but it was just to long winded and round about for me. There were times I just wanted to yell get to the point why do I need ten pages to describe something and why do you need to stop and tell me why you are describing it in detail. The story itself I think is an amazing look into the mind of a pedophile and how they justify what they do. But I just wish he could have done it with less words. Maybe in time I will appreciate the writing style but as I write this review that isn't the case. "

4,Rena Jane,1419,1418,I hated this book. The protagonist's glorification of his pedophilia and playful treatment of such a serious subject was revolting and repulsive to me. I found absolutely no redeeming value in it at all.

4,Mel Eldridge,1424,1423,"I have no trouble understanding why this is often considered as a literary masterpiece. Vladimir's use of words is unnaturally beautiful considering the content of the story, and he vividly captures Humbert's feelings and emotions. However, I could not find it in myself to enjoy this novel or find it pleasurable to read. Despite the eloquent writing I found myself wishing the story would end, just so I no longer had to keep reading the perverted and disturbing musings of the narrator. Whilst this may of been Nabokov's intention, this is not what I look for in a 'good' book. However, I understand that others may feel differently. "
4,Arotella,1428,1427,"Ugh. This book was painful. Not only did the male protagonist make my skin crawl, but the way this book was written made it agonizingly slow to get through. If u are looking to read a ""controversial book"", read something else!!!!"

4,Jeff Thompson,1460,1459,"This book has long been on my list of ""ought to reads"" just because it's a classic. And let me be clear. It is divine and artful prose, some of the most masterful writing I've encountered. BUT, I have to sheepishly admit that I didn't really know what I was getting into. I knew that Lolita chronicles an affair between a middle-aged man and an underage girl. I didn't know beforehand that the girl was 12 years old. So, from the very beginning, I felt deep repulsion (as Nabokov intends -- after all Humbert describes himself as a freak and a monster). Now, I am no prude when it comes to literature. I recognize that there is much that can be learned by seeking to understand human failings, cruelty, and ugliness. So the fact that Humbert is a twisted pedophile is not where I find fault with this book. What is inexcusable to me is Nabokov's reprehensible depiction of the predator's impact (or lack thereof) on Lolita herself. Nabokov portrays Lolita as flirtatiously complicit in the seduction, which is not utterly unbelievable, as there are indeed precocious 12-year-olds in the world. But then Lolita somehow floats above the horrific ravages of protracted sexual abuse, unscathed. She seems to suffer little emotional trauma, and ultimately, after being the target of two sexual predators, manages to find a stable, though not ideal, marital relationship. This is thoroughly beyond credibility. The devastating effects of pedophilia on its victims is beyond dispute, and I have witnessed that effect on a few women in my acquaintance. To allow Lolita to blithely move on after being a child sex toy is a grotesque disservice to women who suffer the abuse of actual predators. I suspect that my reaction is all the stronger because I am the father of a 12-year-old myself. As I was reading Humbert's lurid accounts of the pleasures of statutory rape, I couldn't help but wonder how many mentally imbalanced people had been influenced by this book to consider taking that pleasure to themselves. If even one child became a victim of a would-be Humbert as a result of this ""classic,"" it would not be worth whatever literary value it might have added to the world. If that 12-year-old daughter was your own, I can't imagine you disagreeing. On the other hand, if Nabokov had at least given us a realistic view into the distortion, confusion, and chaos that would have attended a real Lolita as a result of her abuse, I might change my opinion about this book. When I read about a flawed protagonist, I want to end the book feeling sympathy toward him or her at the same time that I feel deepened sorrow for their mistakes. With Lolita, I somehow finished the book feeling the opposite: I was completely cold toward the protagonist, and - to my horror - found that my revulsion toward his pedophilia had somehow dulled. That is not a contribution worth the pages it is printed on, no matter how elevated the prose. "
4,Simon Vandereecken,1468,1467,"Enfin fini, et quelle torture, quelle horreur que ce livre. Bien sûr c'est un classique avec tout ce que cela comporte de jugement biaisés mais mon dieu ... Même si le style est intéressant, le contenu est à mes yeux parfaitement repoussant. J'ai eu l'impression de lire les mémoires de Marc Dutroux, à travers un personnage plaintif et larmoyant sur lequel j'étais apparemment sensé m'apitoyer. Mais on parle quand même d'un vieux pervers qui kidnappe et viole une jeune fille de douze ans ! Je ne comprends vraiment pas comment on peut apprécier cette histoire et ressentir de l'empathie pour le personnage de Humbert Humbert ou même trouver la moindre trace romanesque dans cet opus. Je le range gentiment à côté des 120 jours de Sodome, même écrin stylistiquement parfait mais au contenu immonde."

4,Marinn,1495,1494,"Perhaps I'm a prude or take its subject matter too literally, but I was unable to find beauty in this book. As a person who loves literature and loves to discuss literature, I really wanted to find some redeemable good quality in the book, but I failed to do so."
4,Alida,1498,1497,"Sorry no amount of beautiful prose makes up for the fact that I want to scrub my brain after finishing this. I wish I could un-hear it. As such I wish I could rate this ""I hated it"" instead of merely ""didn't like it"". I read it because I'm working through the world classics' little by little. It is indeed a fascinating psychological study of a disgusting, filthy, cowardly and deluded pedophile. A sad love story, sure, in the same way that date rape is consensual sex.Any identification or sympathy in any way shape or form for Humbert is only possible if you fall for his manipulations and/or you are clueless enough or ignorant about the life-time effects of this abuse on victims of pedophiles. To have sympathy for Humbert is the same as having sympathy for Ted Bundy or the BTK killer. At least they put an end to the suffering of their victims. Humbert's murder of Lolita's soul will endure as daily torture for as long as she lives. "

4,Alexandria,1508,1507,"I won't go into the sexual nature of this novel, other than to say that Nabokov's entire approach to such material will disquiet even the most hardened of readers. There is rarely explicit description, for which I am thankful, but the implications of certain phrases left me numb and cold. Indeed, I still don't know what to make of most of the novel, other than to say this:I believe this book is only a classic because it is shocking. Nabokov's writing is drearily detail-heavy, and his language becomes florid at the most odd of times. The novel could have been a great deal shorter, but Nabokov seemed to like the sound of his narrator's voice. And as for Humbert's justifications for his attraction to pre-pubescent Dolores Haze, I can only say that they are flimsy at best and yet Nabokov presents them as eerily concrete convictions worthy of consideration. I was left, as I said, cold and numb after the completion of this novel. I don't see why it is a classic, and I now view it as a kind of gauntlet I had to survive in order to really say that I am open to reading any kind of literature. Never again will I pick up this novel, and I would not recommend it to anyone unless they want their view of humanity suddenly, sharply, and almost irreparably dimmed."

4,Susan  Odetta,1527,1526,"Brad picked this up from the ""banned books"" bin featured at the Hilo Public Library. He read it and urged me to do so. I can understand why the book was banned in 1955; the protagonist is a preferencial pedophile. The book is written from the pedophile's point of view in excruciating detail of that mindset, and herein lies the problem. His view is predictably disgusting and eventually boringly so. There seemed to be no point to the story...period. By about 1/3 through, I wished fervently for someone to kill him off.....it didn't happen. Reading this was a completely distasteful waste of time and I finished the damn book swearing at my husband for suggesting that I read it. The book, had it not been banned, might have simply bored the readers to death in 1955 and then it would not have become such a big lasting deal for so many decades since. I recommend ""don't bother"". "
4,Mila Zuliana,1528,1527,"*pants*I’m not cut for this stuff.I had such a hard time finishing this book, and I can’t say that I enjoyed it. If this book was a movie, I would probably keep nodding my head off in my seat and keep being elbowed by something that says that I’ve bought the damn ticket so I’d better go through it with my eyes open.Now, listen, I’m not bashing and saying that this book is a bad work, because, hell no! It is beautiful. It is a work of majestic (and somewhat lewd) art. And if it was a movie, it would be an Oscar winner movie, the one everyone raves about but nobody completely understands (by nobody of course I meant myself, please don’t get offended).It’s not the theme (the controversial theme of pedophilia) that made me have a difficult time enjoying the book. I mean, the first reason I wanted to read this book was because I like me some age difference relationship (lol). It’s one of my secret kinks (well, not so secret anymore now), and, it’s Lolita! An icon. Sure I had to read it. But then my intelligence is not yet on this level of genius (and to be honest I feel sorry for myself, because it makes me seem uneducated, but whatever). It was like visiting an art gallery, full of brilliant works, and I was just staring and nodding with a serious face but actually thinking, “What the hell am I doing here?”This book is full with beautiful words and difficult ones too. I don’t think my vocabulary covered them all. Nabokov used a lot of French which I know nothing about. I wish I can comment on it more here but to be perfectly honest I was extremely out of the loop. I kept groping blindly through my way, and when I finally saw the light at the end of tunnel, I couldn’t be more grateful.This book is wonderful and all, but I just didn’t enjoy reading it. I guess I should stick with my average reading materials and stop pretend to be smart, lol."

4,Karolinaaa,1543,1542,"I totally hated this book. I can't understand why is it so famous. I'll give just one star because Nabokov made me hate Humbert more than any other character. I find this “romance” really stupid. I cannot express how much I hated this! It's really sad, how a “classic” it's one of the worst books I've ever read. I don't recommend it at all, it may be that I'm silly, but still, I hated this book. "
4,Linda Hua,1545,1544,"It's been years since I haven't finished any I've picked up. This was the book that broke that streak. Aside from the hard-to-swallow pedophilic nature of the story, I found the narrator, Humbert Humbert, to be conceited and unnecessarily verbose. I got 76% of the way through the story, but I couldn't finish it--book two was just far too dry and meandering for me to care to continue."
4,Laura Macdonald,1550,1549,"Very disturbing and I'm sure that it is possibly fantastically written and a great insight into the mind of a paedophile, but I struggled to contain my nausea whilst reading this.

My beloved lecturer did well to advise me not to write about it in exams all those years ago."

I am a fan of the russian classics and thought this book of the 50's might be my taste as well.However, I cannot understand how people can enjoy this book. It is full with word games that are impressive given that the author is no native speaker, but are rather annoying for the reader. Actually some chapters are down right torture. The characters stay flat through the whole story. To be honest I had to put the book away after about half or 60 percent. I know that some books are not pleasent to read at times, but you feel rewarded once you are past those passages. In this book, however, I had no hope that this would ever happen. "
4,Doha Hotait,1577,1576,"provocative, But not my cup of tea. "
4,Emilycbelanger,1580,1579,"This book does something that's very interesting: it gets into the mind of a pedophile (note: he is a pedophile, not just someone who has an affair with a younger woman) and humanizes the character, while still showing just how horrible every he's doing truly is.But I don't think this book should exist. Far too many people read it and walk away duped by this unreliable narrator into thinking that the relationship was actually consensual. Plus, reading it is a traumatic experience."
4,Miranda-Hermione,1581,1580,"Okay, okay, I get it. Great literature, timeless classic, elevates the flawed hero into an art form, blah, blah, blah. But seriously, Mr. Nabokov, would it have killed you to come up with a more believable plot? I've read better fanfiction than what you came up with. It's not just the pedophilia, although 200+ pages detailing how irresistible little girls can be--and how Humbert Humbert goes about acting on that desire--is not exactly my idea of a pleasurable read. I can see what Nabokov was trying to do here. He's trying to create the most despicable character he can come up with (Humbert Humbert, bohemian pedophile extraordinaire) and, through perspective and slanted writing, turn him into a sympathetic character. And he almost pulls it off. Just not quite. Humbert can plead all he wants about his feelings and his reasons and his situation. I just wasnn't buy it. What I could tell was supposed to come off as persuasive, to draw the reader in, merely served to push me farther away from the novel. By the end, I would happily have burned every copy of the book I could lay my hands on.It is, admittedly, a very interesting concept for Nabokov to have tried. I applaud him for managing to write this book. I just wish I hadn't had to read it. On the other hand, I can attest that this book will stick in my brain for a very, very long time. "

4,Lilli,1634,1633,"Found it incredibly difficult to read, not just because of the subject matter (which is a constant struggle to ingest) but also because of the repetition. I understood the subject matter long before I picked the book up, I have never avoided a book highly recommended purely because of the content. Whilst it is difficult to read about, I like the idea that this book sheds a small light on a problem not often spoke about.However as Lolita continues no part of the plot made me feel anything. I wasn't excited, on edge, saddened or indeed joyful about any part of the story. I admit, slightly disgusted but this book didn't bring up the strong emotions I feel whilst reading a good book. It was a shame really, I thought I would like this one."
4,P,1635,1634,"Do you find descriptions of child rape ""lyrical, poetic and aesthetically pleasing""? If so, here's the book for you. I have a difficult enough time seeing grown women treated like sexualized objects but when it happens to little girls, I can only see red. Poor Lolita, what kid deserved such a life--even in a fictionalized universe. And the fact that this novel and its Vietnam War cheerleader, Nixon-loving, closet paedophile (if you doubt the charge, see an article by Brandon Centerwall in an academic literary journal for details) author is touted as high literature is just another fact to file under 'Things that are Wrong with Humanity.'"

4,Ben Winch,1657,1656,"There are books I read in my late teens or early twenties and disliked only to return to them later with the suspicion that the failure had been mine and to love them. This is not one of them. Not only was my first impression total indifference, but every time I've felt tempted to dip into it since I've been immediately repelled by the artificial, uninspired, unconvincing prose - the type of watered-down and kitsched-up Poe-isms that I excise immediately from extreme embarrassment when they appear in my own writing. Not only that, but my reasons for picking the thing up again are never deeply-felt, just a kind of exasperated 'OK I'll take another look' whenever I'm reminded how many people who otherwise share my tastes seem to revere it. But f**k that - this sucks. When I read Kafka at nineteen, OK, I didn't get it, but it haunted me, and one glance at Metamorphosis a few years later was enough to convince me. But this doesn't haunt me, nor does it disturb me, just leaves me indifferent. Florid ham-acting and ugly to boot, Lolita is just not my cup of tea.POSTSCRIPT: Ugh!

4,Magnolia,1690,1689,"I hate Lolita. I think Nabokov is writing about the violence inherent in authorship, a theme he touches on in other books. Nabokov chooses the violation of a young girl by an older man who consistently reinterprets her actions to suit his strange and violent fantasies to make his point and it is extraordinarily well-made, but harrowing to read. I spent most of the book wanting to take revenge on Humbert.The disturbing thing about this book is the way so many readers uncritically believe the words of an unrepentant child molester because his is the voice the novel is narrated from. I cringe every time the book comes up; even though I do think it is an important work that makes a fascinating point, I am greatly disturbed by the number of people who miss the point and just think Humbert is a artful narrator and Lolita a teasing slut."

It would set a precedent for more stories that would become more deviant, and debasing as time marched on with each decade we would see an increase in the use and abuse to young girls, as sexual objects and sexualization before their time.

Why would a repulsive love story of a pedophile get so much hype? The author, undoubtedly, has an excellent grip on his writing style.

And it was given in such a self celebratory tone of voice, that it made me want to shriek.This is my own opinion, of course. You don't need to agree. "
4,Sheila ,1725,1724,Ugh! I'm not impressed. This is nothing more than the sick story of a pedophile and the poor girl whom he sets his sites on. 
4,Rosie,1729,1728,didn't finish it because too boring oops 
4,Shalaka Nanda Kumar,1734,1733,The author makes it okay to be a pedophile. I was disgusted half way and couldnt bring myself to go any further.
4,Joel,1743,1742,"Sorry, I just couldn't get past the subject matter on this one. 'Lolita' was just about the creepiest thing I've ever read - maybe I should shelve it as 'horror'. The writing was a bit dense for my tastes, too."

4,Yeliz,1765,1764,"Lolita is like a mirage in the desert. It's made to look challenging and ultimately satisfying but what it really is is just a hollow image of something it can never be. In other words, as complex and detailed the mirage (or Nabokov's prose) may seem, it's just a feather in the wind. Overall, I came to believe this book has survived on its shock value alone but that's not enough for me to deem it an important literary piece. Mr. Nabokov's ""brilliant wordplay"" or prose lacks what I call- a life. A book can't haunt you if it never had a life to begin with. Lolita is one of those... I don't see myself ever going back to quote it someday, or longing to read it once more, or telling others of its message, or recognizing the influence its had on my perspective. Which is to say- Nabokov's ""brilliant prose"" did nothing for me because it carried no weight."
4,Trevor Shane,1767,1766,He's a lovely writer. I read poetry for its poetry. I read books for the story.
4,Hologram Mary,1774,1773,"This one was in the bookstore under the employee recommendations and having heard much about it and the employee's blurb piquing my interest, I FEARFULLY picked it up. It turned out that the referring employee was the one checking me out that day and she had more to say about it which almost had me returning it to the shelves in peril. See, I was a new mom at the time and hormonal and over sensitive I was, not to mention that now with having a daughter, the subject matter of this book was basically my worst nightmare. Never in a million years could I have anticipated that someone could make a subject of this nature so... BORING! It did not shock or horrify me. I wasn't left aghast like I thought I would be. It was basically another story of unrequited love. Plus, it was a little hard to follow. The referring employee told me that this was written in English which was Nabokov's eighth language. Read with that in mind, I was impressed, but the story... SNOOZEVILLE! And besides it caused me to have ""Don't Stand So Close To Me"" by The Police stuck in my head for a month! *raspberry*"
4,Nicole ,1780,1779,"I know this is a classic, but I couldn't get through it. It wasn't even the subject matter of a man rambling on about his obsession for 7th graders, it was the rambling. I thought the writing was horrible, badly constucted and I couldn't handle it."
4,Karina,1783,1782,"Despite Nobokov's obvious writing talent, I had a difficult time muddling through the book's premise...this is not a ""love story,"" as touted by a reviewer. This is pedophilia."
4,Pru,1789,1788,"not an easy-flow read, no french-to-english translations and plenty words to look up. good thing for Kindle built-in dictionary. typical Nabokov. still trying...hard time following. ADD kicks in..."
4,Cathy Turner,1790,1789,Did not enjoy this at all!
4,Amber Koppenhofer,1791,1790,"Long, laborious ribbons of unnecessary narrative make for a beautifully written but boring story of one man's obsession with a girl far to young for him. Nabokov no doubt has a way with words, but his tedious descriptions did not keep my attention. Making words into art does not disguise this pathetic tale of pedophilia. I almost didn’t finish listening to it. I nearly gave up numerous times. The main character is simply unlikable, not only because he is a pedophile, but because he is a pompous ass. The only redeeming thing about this audiobook is that it is narrated by Jeremy Irons. If you like long arduous accounts of characters and landscapes, if you are a fan of poetry, and if you don’t mind reading about a man’s lust for a little girl, then maybe this is the book for you, but for me, I will be happy to delete the files from my MP3 player and never revisit this novel again."

4,Drew Cernava,1813,1812,"
“There is no other bliss on earth comparable to that of fondling a nymphet.”
I'm not quite sure what to say about this book. On one hand, the topic is so perverted and sickening, but on the other, it's quite possibly the most beautifully written piece of literature I've ever come across.The plot disgusted me; it was about a fully-grown man being attracted to and abusing a little girl. But Nabokov's writing was absolutely incredible.
“Can you remember,” she said, “what was the name of that hotel, you know [nose pucketed], come on, you know—with those white columns and the marble swan in the lobby? Oh, you know [noisy exhalation of breath]—the hotel where you raped me.”

4,Carina Mørch-storstein,1815,1814,This was too disgusting. Couldn't finish it!
4,Ramsey Hootman,1816,1815,"I've been meaning to read this book for a long time, but now that I've started I find it's just not something I want to spend any time on. I get that it's clever and well-written, but neither of these things is reason enough for me to spend any more time than I have to in the head of a pedophile. It's pretty creepy, and not in an enjoyable way. So... yeah. Didn't finish."
4,Carie,1822,1821,"I have a hard time understanding why this is a classic. The writing style was lovely, but I found nothing in the story that moved me --- at no point during the read did I become engrossed in the story. This is why it took me a month to read and why when I finished it I ran around the house celebrating finally getting to move on to a (hopefully) more transporting book. As a secondary note, I find the summaries of this book and blurbs intended to entice the reader entirely misleading. Can't we just have an honest advertisement --- it is a story about obsession and pedophilia and how a wretched adult justifies abusing a child."
4,Rachel Arens,1824,1823,"i couldn't keep reading...i kept thinking that it must have a redemptive ending because i've heard people like this book, but i just couldn't even get to the end. "
4,Johanna H.,1835,1834,"The book was very hard even impossible for me to rate because of the challenging topic. I can't make me like this.. Even though i was deeply disturbed i continued reading the book thinking (or hoping) to find the turning point which would make me like this, make me like the narrator, feel sympathy for him or forget for even a second what a horrible, perverse, life wrecking and dirty old man he was. I tried to find the masterwork classic that everyone was talking about. I didn't find it. I must admit that the author was very good in twisting the word to his use, he wrapped this story in gold with his witty and poetic language. But under this wrapping it was was it was..The narrator was a paedophile who married a woman to get near her preteen daughter, who ""kidnapped"" this said daughter and raped her every night while she cried herself to sleep thinking that he was asleep. Who hit her because he thought she flirted with boys her age, abused and controlled her. Even though the author sometimes overshadowed this part of the story it was still there under the surface. The story wasn't told in a obscene way, there were not much details but that doesn't mean they weren't there. Oh and the irony at the end. Everyone who read the book will know what i'm talking about. It was an insight into the mind of a sick man and it disturbed me deeply.. I couldn't see this as just a novel, no because it really happens, everywhere in the world. The word Lolita is now even used as a term. Our media is full of it and even if they don't know the book everyone will know the famous Lolita. The picture of a Lolita will be different for me from now on. There was nothing romantic here, Lolita didn't wanted it she always said it was rape and Humbert Humbert (a fantastic name, right?) was a sick perverted man who had a poetic way of speaking which couldn't distract from the sick things he said and the crimes he committed. Since the times this book was published our world has changed a lot. We live in a digital world now and our society has so much information at hand with just a click. The whole world is connected and we can educate ourselves about every topic wherever and whenever we want. Cases of child abuse come up daily in the news and we know a lot more on how to avoid things like this.. But it still happens to often. We know now a lot more on how children get affected by it too. If the book came out today it would probably be out of Lolitas sight. I don't think it would become a classic today too. People nowadays will see the story probably different from then. And i'm sure that everyone even if they loved this book and gave it five stars know how sick Humberts behaviour was.But i think the problem that many people have here is that we don't want to believe that people who do things like this are normal humans like us. We can't imagine them doing everyday things like everyone, having a normal work, we don't want to imagine them as teachers, office worker or going grocery shopping . It is easier to think of them as evil people through and through. It is a revolting thought for us that EVERYONE could be a child abuser. But this book challenged this belief. Humbert is not just a paedophile, he is an intelligent man he writes poesie, can speak several languages, he even loves Lolita in his own weird way which must be something good, right? He wants to control her yes but he wants to protect her too. He abuses her but he is somehow a father figure for her too.We see the world through his eyes and maybe that is the answer to that.Maybe that makes it hard for us to believe that he is evil and the things he does are wrong. We should not forget that he sees the world different too. No one else would say that a eleven year old flirted with him. But he does.. Maybe he just interpreted it like he wanted it to. We must not forget that Lolita was twelve years old and he turned into this kind of sick twisted father figure for her. Trying to drug her, rape her. There was NO consent to this and she did NOT enjoy what he did to her. She lost her mother and had nowhere to go. She even believed that he killed her mother (which he did in some way). She was a child and he took everything from her what she needed and turned her into some kind of compliant sex slave.No author, not even Shakespeare himself could justify Humberts actions here. This books is not bad. By no means.. It was a challenging topic and i had to make myself read further many times because it shocked me. I don't there's anyone who reads this book and goes out of it without some questions and things to think over. I can recommend it for people who know what awaits them. It is NOT a love story it is a story about abuse and rape."
4,R,1840,1839,"Boring, florid, unlikeable characters."
4,Norrin2,1844,1843,"The intelligentsia mafia will call you a prude if you dare speak heresy about Lolita not being a great book. But there are other reasons to not like this book. Maybe it's just me but when I read fiction I need to have at least one character I can identify with or pull for, and I hate everybody in this book, Lolita, her mom, the pervert with the same first and last name. And if I'm going to spend time with people I hate I might as well go to work. "
4,Sally Siawidjaja,1846,1845,"I read the Indonesia translated version... and it's not my cup of tea... I guess the writer is success full in showing the emotions of the pedophile, but story wise, it is boring. "
4,KT,1850,1849,"I disliked this book intensely, although I'm aware I'm just about the only person on earth who does. I never got into Nabokov's worldview or his language, and just how the hell did Clare Quilty find Lolita initially anyway? Why is Humbert so freaked out about it, since they clearly have similar ends and could meet up? And Lolita barely has a voice here. It's an interesting premise, but reading the book was like chewing on gravel."
4,Aaron Burns,1852,1851,"Turgid, pretentious tripe. That Nabokov is a skilled writer seems to be a point he intends to make with every word of this revolting book, which presents a sense of desperation and a lack of humor. It's as if he prepared a wonderfully eloquent cake made of shit, and demands you admire the cake for it's eloquence. Humbert Humbert is a disgusting lecher, and spending time with him is highly unpleasant - as much for his overblown sense of self as his pedophilia. A Platonist might present this as exhibit A in his prosecution against poetry:""What is the redeeming feature of this novel? I'd argue that it is as imbalanced to write with eloquence on the subject of garbage, as to write garbage on the subject of eloquence.""Humbert Humbert is a cynical pedophile who commits the unforgivable sin of being boring. Lolita is sensationalism with a thesaurus."

4,Bucletina,1860,1859,"Un libro que sólo me ha producido desagrado y al que no logro encontrarle ningún valor literario. Hay una solapada connivencia del autor hacia la relación entre un adulto y una niña. Sí, se supone que todos sabemos que el tipo es un pederasta, un asqueroso monstruo, pero hay personajes así de desagradables que logran despertar emociones, y que nos llevan a una especie de montaña rusa literaria. Debería haber algo detrás de la historia. Yo no lo encontré. "
4,Jody,1863,1862,"I can't say I'm glad that I've read this book. I can say that I'm glad to be able to mark it off as read, both here and on my mental 'to-read' list. But I wish I had never read it.Oh sweet Jesus. I absolutely loathed this book.The subject matter was, of course, vile. I feel like I need to go and have a bath in disinfectant, bleach my brain - anything to get this filth off me. But, subject matter aside, this was the most pretentious piece of crap I've read in a long time. Long-winded, at times completely pointless, and God, the parts in French - enough already! The narration style was (to me) absolutely irritating - his incessant talking of himself in the third person (Humbert Humbert), as well as his ridiculous nicknames for *himself*. It was obvious that he was a complete lunatic. He really did not appear to have any remorse for what he had done, or indeed any real acknowledgement that he had done anything 'wrong'. He was obviously trying to endear himself to his 'readers'. Nabokov was obviously very skilled - he's an incredibly memorable character, and quite possibly the only character I despise even more than Joffrey from Game of Thrones. Absolutely no redeeming features or qualities whatsoever. I can't remember a book ever making me feel like this before. That in itself is worth something, I suppose, but I just don't know how to rate this book. I am wavering between one star - because I truly detested it like nothing else - and five stars, because it's clearly a masterful piece of literature.So three stars it is - I'll split the difference. And I would never, never, never recommend this book to anyone. Ever.Edited on 30th June 2015 - down to one star. I hate this book more & more as time passes."

No matter the great craftsmanship of Nabokov, this is a book about a pedophile.No matter the deep psychological look the author takes into the mind, this is a book about a pedophile. And I cannot find an excuse for that. I just can't seem to separate the facts and judge to book just on one level and completely ignore the ""ugly"" parts. "
4,Celina Rose,1869,1868,"Oh where to begin...I did not care for this book at all. Yes, Nabokov's writing is full of literary references, and he uses beautiful symbolism in his writing that is indicative of a classical writer. However, even with an annotated version of this book, I could not get past the subject matter. Also, I did not understand the references he made, nor did I try to understand it. I could not find a single character that I could like, and the entire time I just wanted the book to end. I don't care that this book is considered a classic, I did not enjoy this book for one single second. "

4,Lismary,1885,1884,Even one star is too much for this book! I gave it one star because the author has a good style of writing but this has to be one of the worse books I've ever read. I really cannot see what could be so enjoyable in this book I could not connect with the book and Humbert Humbert does not really love Lolita. I have to say I don't that love that everyone else sees its not love it's him feeding his ego and his desires. He liked nothing about Lolita he loved his idea of her not what she really was. This book was sick. 
4,Frances Davidson,1891,1890,"hmmm... would not recommend. I made it over halfway through but was wincing far too much to enjoy it further. one of three books I couldn't finish.

I suspect not."
4,Waode Heni,1901,1900,"I 40% tried to read it religiously but ended up skimming the rest of the book. I couldn't see the moral value, if any. I couldn't stand the point of view of a paedophilia."
4,Marc Manley,1905,1904,"I fail to see why people love this book. There is a pitiful attempt to look at the book through the lens of the Belles lettres, but given the book's crass subject matter, I find little room to do nothing other than condemn it for what it is.A lot has been written on Nabokov's storytelling capabilities as well as his love for language, which is supposed to be fascinating since English is his third of fourth language. This, combined with Nabokov's very troubling tale of pedophilia, child pornography, and sexual molestation, in which at the very end, the author attempts to not-so-subtly convince his reader that Humbert is the lesser of two evils, makes for a very disappointing book. This was a required reading for an English course this Fall."

4,Bridget McNamara-Bates,1936,1935,"I fucking hate this book! If i could i would give this book only half a star.The useless flowery language and charming descriptions hide a a book of murders, jealousy and a painful parody of incest. The continual self-loathing and pity party of What-ever-his-fucking-name-was (lets call him HH) was infuriating to read, the only thing more horrifying was HH's ability to divide young children (girls) into 'plain' or 'fuckable little nymphets' who clearly seduced him by merely existing. As the book goes on, it covers HH's attempts to play Lolita's father. From the sickening joke of marrying the mother to trap the daughter, the ploy is extended to cross all problems. Everything is solved by murder or rape, and the persona's self hatred forces a measure of compassion which the sickening fuckwit does not deserve.The use of french is annoying and the struggle of translating bizarre phases (without using a translator) is the only thing that kept me from setting this book on fire, and crying.To cap, i hate this book and use of flowery detail to escape the actual acts of abuse enrage me to no end.

I really thought this was going to be about him adoring little girls in a nostolgic sweet fashion in his old age. I wasn't expecting him to try to live out his lost fantasies of his prepubercent years. I have to say I didn't want to give this thing any stars. Maybe because I'm a mother including 2 little girls that I can't get past the fact that he's a pedophile. I don't care if it's consensual or whatever. It's sick. I'm upset that such a book can be considered a classic.

4,Geoffrey Todd,1987,1986,"“Lolita” by the Russian author Vladimir Nabokov, a Russian writing in his third language, was published in 1955. It is set in the USA and is the story of a middle-aged academic “Humbert Humbert” who is exclusively attracted to pre pubescent children aged between 12 and 14. He becomes sexually obsessed with a particular 12 year old girl, Dolores Haze who he nicknames “Lolita”. Humbert contrives to become her stepfather and when subsequently her mother dies suddenly, takes Lolita on a bizarre journey around the USA, raping her in a series of seedy motels. The book is recognised as a “classic” and is for example included on Time’s list of the 100 Best English Novels in the English Language from 1923 to 2005. It appears on school syllabuses but its difficult subject matter is witnessed by the existence of another book advising how it should be “taught”.Nabokov’s portrayal of the central character “Humbert” is that of a paedophile (ICD – 10, World Health Organisation International Classification of Diseases). According to the author, he extensively studied “similar case histories” to fashion the character of his anti-hero. Humbert as a young teenager has a thwarted sexual relationship with a 12 year old, but as he gets older his sexual preferences fail to mature. Subsequently he only ever finds 12 to 14 year old girls sexually attractive but also they must have certain characteristics eg pallor, thinness, brown legs, white ankle socks etc. A real turn on for Humbert is soft downy body hair which he describes in, what is for him, highly erotic detail. He prefers to stay in lodgings beside play grounds to better observe “nymphets” as he calls them. Using textbook paedophile strategy he courts and marries an adult woman whom he finds repulsive, for the sole purpose of gaining access to her 12 year old daughter, Dolores Haze. Humbert evolves a plan to murder the mother but by chance she is killed in an accident. He justifies having sex with a 12 year old with the familiar excuse that in other civilisations it is perfectly acceptable. According to Humbert, “she is asking for it” (of course) and it is she that seduces him rather than he raping her (again, of course). He visits her in the classroom where she is working after school hours and bribes her to jerk him off as he fixates on the narrow pale neck of a “nymphet” sitting in front of them. He exerts both physical and tyrannical emotional control over Lolita, threatening her with all sorts of dire consequences should she tell “their secret” or run away. “I succeeded in terrorising Lo who, despite a certain brash alertness of manner and spurts of wit was not as intelligent a child as her IQ might suggest. But if I manage to establish that background of shared secrecy and shared guilt ………….”. Indeed, Nabokov’s extremely accurate portrayal of the mind and machinations of the paedophile mind is so convincing that it has led some to speculate unsurprisingly that he himself was a closet paedophile, although no such evidence exists.Nabokov’s prose has been much praised, despite his amazing predilection for the use of words that are not commonly or ever used. For example, just now randomly opening the book (honestly), in the space of just a few pages he uses “maquette”, “telestically”, “bemazed”, “nevrotic”, “versimilitude”, “logodaedaly”, “logomancy”, “undinist”, and most ironically “recondite”. There are also frequent lapses into French and for non French speakers, the Penguin edition at least offers no help. Juste ciel, he even exhumes the word “valetudinarian”, which I last came across in Smollett’s “Humphrey Clinker” (1771). Many readers will find the subject matter of this novel dismal and wretched but apparently not the literati. For example “Lolita” is extensively reviewed on Wikipedia with sections entitled “Erotic Motifs and Controversy”, “Style and Interpretation”, “Literary Pastiches Allusions and Prototypes” but the “p” word is avoided absolutely. Perhaps all reviewers of this book need first to sit through a Forensic Medical talk on paedophilia and child abuse. Knowledge of such matters in the early 1950s was minimal but sufficient to make it difficult enough for Nabokov to get his novel published. Over 50 years later there is very much greater and increasing awareness of paedophilia. I suggest that if this novel were now presented to Penguin for publication there would be only two certainties – rejection, quickly followed by a knock on the door from the police. Geoff Todd"

4,Draven,1993,1992,"Could not sympathize with any of the characters. I felt myself holding the story at a distance and could not enjoy the experience whatsoever.I'm an emotional reader and therefore a book of this kind, requires a cool, collected and detached intellectualism I am not capable of."
4,Bettielee,1999,1998,"Ugh. You know what - I have a lot of books to read this year - and I am having a terrible reading month. This book is too long and boring and all I can think is I want to be done with this. So I am quitting it 70%. This is so much of what I hate about our early/mid-20th century literature. Namely - the giant male ego. Blustering, pulsating, throbbing male ego. gah."
4,Gloria,2013,2012,"Seriously? Am I missing something here?Yes, I understand Nabokov has a way with words, but really...?For reasons I won't get into, I had an impossible time separating out that fact from the horrible premise of this story.""Classic literature"" or not, this disturbed me.I would probably read other works by him ... if I can get over my now almost instant aversion to him based solely on this book."
4,Carl Rush,2023,2022,"Started the book... but couldn’t get into it, although I will try again some other time. I had heard that the main character was a paedophile but after reading a few reviews there seems to be a divided opinion on this. So one day I will return and make my own mind up."
4,Brenna,2024,2023,I just could not get through this book. For me the subject matter was troublesome. The way Nabakov writes aobut Lolita and the things Humbert does with and to Lolita just got under my skin. I couldn't help but feel Nabakov himself objectified her in a disturbing way.

4,Katie Story,2035,2034,"I DID NOT like this book. Perhaps, due to the sensitive subject matter, it was revolutionary when originally published; however, I can't understand why it is considered such a classic piece of literature. The term ""lolita"" typically refers to a young girl who is found sexually attractive to older men and the plot follows that definition to a tee. The subject matter is pretty shocking by today's standards, so I can't imagine how audiences perceived it upon release, as I felt Lolita tells a disgusting story about a demented man using beautiful language. It also speaks to a person's inclination to want to explain their actions, as a means of absolution from the crimes commited. "
4,L P,2036,2035,I can't finish this.just no.
4,Angie H,2045,2044,technically I did not finish this book. I read about 140pgs and then the last chapter. This book sickens me.. and I'm not going to put myself through the misery of actually reading it... 
4,Christina Rau,2048,2047,"I didn't actually finish reading Lolita. Going into it, I knew it would be about an older man falling for an underage girl. Still, I didn't realize it would be so, well, CREEPY. I felt like I was becoming one of those teachers on the news who start affairs with their students. This book, simply put, was not for me. It probably shouldn't be for anyone else. I'm not saying it should be censored; I'm saying that it shouldn't be a book anyone labels as their favorite. Just because of the creep factor. Creepy."
4,A. J. McMahon,2049,2048,"Glib and superficial, with nothing much to say apart from the narcissistic obsession of the narrator. It is not at all funny, the people are all unpleasant in one way or another, the prose style is largely verbiage and the storyline thoroughly boring. The whole book goes nowhere from beginning to end. Not worth reading."

4,Penelope,2058,2057,"This is Nabokov... And well, by being Nabokov... I must have read it all wrong. This is an endlessly one-dimensional debased love of an old man for a 12 year old teenager. I tried but I could not felt the collide of hyper civilised Europe with the cheerful barbaric postwar American I'm sure literary critics found myriad reasons that I just don’t happen to see at all. This is grooming and rape.The thematic defense for this book, as it has nothing to offer, except the absurd tale of a weathered old pervert man ogling young girls and choosing one who epitomises his unacceptable desires. Eventually, he has his way with her, completely controlling her young body and mind-f******* a little beautiful teenage. This is a book about a grown man’s obsession and his fornication with a 12 year old girl. And nothing more. "
4,Chrysta,2062,2061,"Oh no, this is not what I was hoping for at all. Flower speech going on and on and on about innocence and peach fuzz. This seemed more about a creepy guy trying to vindicate himself then a story about a young siren sexy and coy... Really, it was just boring."

4,Lance McMurchy,2076,2075,"While this book was never going to be a I would really like, being book about a narcissistic professor sexual relationship with a twelve year girl (having a 9 year old daughter doesn't help). And even though the book being a comedy, a paradox, and may be a few other things -- it did not shirk the morally repugnant consequences of such behaviour. Interesting. So I have to say: It was a strange book. You would think the author would have a sick mind, but I don't think that is the case. He is just describing what is -- and, in some Wittgenstein way -- opening up the issue of pedophilia to public scrutiny. I only topic I can think it relates would be that of suicide; being one of those topics we as a society don't want to talk about (particularly in the late 1950's). And this is why it is seen as a classic. Not because it is a great book; But because Nabokov is opening up a Pandora's box by using comedy to describe a taboo topic.Classics are classics because they are, somehow, special. Not because they are necessarily great works of literature. So I have learnt. "
4,Cindy R,2080,2079,"It may be a classic to some people but I hated it. I suffered through to the bitter end hoping for some redemption or clarity and found none. I couldn't wait to be done with having to listen to the narrator's ceaseless, self-obsessed whining and endless self-pity over losing Lolita and having to deal with a society that doesn't understand his need to be a pedophile. Get thee to a locked facility that will keep children safe from you Humbert!"
4,Meagan,2081,2080,I found this book far too disturbing to enjoy it. Maybe that's the point. I just felt gross reading it.
4,Angelica,2088,2087,"It took me forever to finish this book! Honestly I think that says enough. I had such a hard time staying hooked. I don't like starting and not finishing books, which is really the only reason I persevered.Humbert is so incredibly arrogant and annoying. At times I wish I could've told him to shut up with his rambling and just get straight to the story. I'm disappointed. I think I imagined the book to be more interesting than what it is, just the insane ramblings of a pedophile."
4,Joy (Thoughts of Joy),2092,2091,Read my thoughts at: Thoughts of Joy...
4,ian nix,2093,2092,"I don't know why, in the present literary climate, stories need to be disgustingly raw to be called art or beautiful. This was not beautiful and I don't know what Nabokov accomplished artistically other than a few brilliant phrase-turns. He's a great writer, but I don't want to read about a guy in his mid-thirties getting his rocks off with a nine year-old."
4,Sasha,2095,2094,"Read it because I felt like I should after reading ""Reading Lolita in Tehran."" Wasn't impressed by it bur feel like it should be read because its known as a classic."
4,Lorian Bruce,2096,2095,"Has the male of the species progressed since this work was created? Judging by the Victoria Secret Commercials, I think not."
4,Charmaign Mauren,2101,2100,"I tried to read this book out of curiosity when I read the plot. The author plays with his words and most of the time I could read French words which makes me stop and look up at my online translator to know what it means. Well the emotion of the author is so intense that he wrote it beautifully which makes me feel it. I don't think there is something wrong about the book. Every author can express anything. So when you don't feel like reading it, it is okay. And I could say I recommend young girls to reading it. It is not forbidden. I have read romance novels when I was young. It should do just fine. "
4,Kristine,2121,2120,"One word: Meh.Wanna read literature that's actually revolutionary? Read a memoir or a story of a girl who was a victim of abuse from her own point of view. Trust me, no 3 pages of painstaking details/wordplay of furniture in there.Nabokov's writing is inventive and oftentimes quite poetic and beautiful. But subject matter makes me want to burn it. Not sure what sort of revolutionary idea you're supposed to take from this, old men have been lusting after young women since the dawn of patriarchy and still are. All it really does is try and get you to sympathize with the guy by painting him as a human who doesn't want to act on his desires, which isn't a new idea either. Why is this considered a classic? I don't get it. Honestly reading it was a waste of my time.“Words without experience are meaningless.” Wish Nabokov could've taken his own advice."
4,Jennn,2122,2121,"The prose was lovely, but the story was a bit weak. However, due to the content matter, I had to put it down. I usually don't get squeamish, but I suppose that this is the line I draw. Great vocabulary usage, though..."
4,Alla,2127,2126,the author was a sick man. at first it started as a decent story but ends with a bunch of sick pedophile thoughts. i couldn't even finish it. i thought i throw up.
4,Amy Jones,2129,2128,"I will concede that this is an extremely well written book, but if you are wondering whether or not to embark on this literary classic, let me give you this friendly warning: Lolita is not just a book about pedophilia, the reader becomes the pedophile. Our narrator, Humbert Humbert goes into excessive and explicit detail while chronicling his lust for Lolita. The reader is not just a passive observer, the reader is an accomplice. While I have read several books with controversial content, this is the first and only book I have ever thrown away. If you choose to descend into the depths of depravity with Humbert, be prepared to feel perverse and dirty. His mind is not a place I feel comfortable, so I never finished the journey. "
4,❁Lisa Ann❃,2138,2137,"Since I listened to the Audible version, I wish there was a separate rating available for the narrator, as Jeremy Irons would receive a 5++ from me!!Regarding the story itself, it does contain much elegant prose, however I could not get beyond the subject matter. It may be touted by some as a love story, but in my opinion neither character is capable of feeling unselfishly motivated feelings for another person. By the time I reached the mid-way point in the plot, I just wanted to get to the end of the story asap!!"
4,Michaela,2139,2138,Maybe I'm still not old enough but I just did not get it and felt disgusted most of the time.
4,Rachel Kopel,2154,2153,"Looking back on this book, I would not read it today. I am much more sensitive to sexual abuse and exploitation."
5,Julie M,4,3,"This book was boring and a terrible story. The descriptions were great, but that's about all."
5,Tim Weakley,5,4,"I have to divide this review in two.Firstly, I have to say that I was biased against this book before I even began because of the subject matter. There is just no way in which you can paint this material as uplifting, or mind broadening, or anything positive that I can think of. Yet it continues to make the various lists of ""great works"". I am not narrow minded...mostly ;) This book however is beyond the bounds of endurance for me. It was difficult to complete.Secondly, I have to look at the bones and blood of the book. Did the author accomplish what he set out to do? Did the work affect me? Yes on both counts. The writing, with the exception of the supposed conflict at the end of the book, I thought was very well done. The combat at the end actually had me laughing because it seemed so silly. Maybe there was supposed to be tension, I'm not sure, but it really hit me as funny.Also...let's not pretend that this is a love story. This entire thing is about control, and mental illness on the part of Humbert and Dolores. He keeps telling himself that he is in love. He doesn't even know what love is. He's fixated on a child that he has turned into a possession. The climactic struggle of the work occurs when some other mental defective manages to steal his toy. His world unravels because he is finally forced to see that it was false and based on this playhouse that he had built around the young girl.I'm not going to go into the perverse mindset required to see a child as a sexual object. The work provokes reactions and strong opinion so in that respect I would say that it is a successful book. Could I have done without reading it? Yes truthfully. Is it a ""great"" work? I think the race of man can aspire to much better things than reading about the thoughts of rapists and pedophiles. It's not great. At most I think history will see it as a curiosity. "
5,floowee,6,5,"I have to say one thing... It was hard to finish!! Probably because I read the Indonesian translation. There were to many confusing words and the plot didn't seem coherence one to another. It took me quite a time to finally finish it. Despite all the difficulties, the final chapter was a real enlightenment. It revealed nearly all of my questions for the whole story. And indeed, it is a twisted piece as the rumour said it. I can't give a good rating for it, since I don't like the translated version, but someday, I might read the English version and like it more. "
5,Maddie Holden,7,6,"It's hard for me to classify this as a book I've ""read"" when I could hardly even make it over halfway through. I'm sure that any positive reviews about this book are in regards to the lovely writing style, the seemingly heart-wrenching quality of a forbidden love, or the overall popularity of this book. To me, this book is so famous because of one reason: it is terribly controversial. I'm not sure how many people can stomach reading the tale of a middle aged man preying on a pre-teen girl - his step-daughter no less! What some may see as romantic reports of trying to fight the odds to have a happily ever after, I see as the obsession and possession of a young child by an insane and creepy man of a father's age. This book is more criminal than enjoyable. It's horrid, disturbing, and down-right pedophiliac. I would suggest against reading this if you're looking for a truly enjoyable book that won't put your mind at unease."
5,Reza,12,11,"Yeah, I thought this book was okay. It hooked me in with the first two paragraphs, and then slowly became a struggle to read. I found him to be long-winded and pretentious. In short, I was bored the majority way through."
5,Hawra Alq,13,12,I honestly thought the book was over rated by my friends who made it sound so good. The author's writing was so confusing at times that i was literally dragging through each chapter hoping for it to get better. 
5,Pinkyivan,15,14,"Overall I'd describe it as a good insight into a twisted mind, much like A Scaner Darkly or The Gambler, but even as that it doesn't offer that much. It has more complex language than the two, in fact the writing is what made me interested in it. If it had a more standard writing I probably wouldn't have finished it.It is a good read, but somehow I feel it has not earned the praise it is so often given. In terms of content it is not on the level of other classics and in terms of aesthetics Proust, Poe and heck even Dostoyevsky do a better job (if you got the right translation of course).All in all the best thing about this book is the influance it had on Gene Wolfe so I'm very glad that it exists."

5,Dave Yan,23,22,"It took me about two weeks to finish reading Lolita. To my disappointment, due to the exclamation of the best work by Nabokov, I felt it difficult to comprehend the flow but read it up anyway. Compared with his Laughter in the Dark, this one is in a totally level of reading difficulty for a English as a second language reader. Guess I have learned quite a lot of vocabulary for sure. "
5,Morten,24,23,"Jeg er ikke til ord-gejl, så jeg fandt den noget kedelig! Halvvejs inde, og det må være nok. Gider ikke læse resten. Humbert prøver at skrive/snakke sig fra det forkastelige han gør, og det er da en interessant nok historie, men fortabelsen i ligegyldige detaljer var dråben for mig."
5,Cherie Medford,25,24,"It's a classic, so I read it to see what all the fuss was about. Definitely controversial, especially for the time period, but not much else can be said for it, at least not by me. In three hundred twenty some odd pages, nothing happens. The beginning of the book, where he talks about life before meeting Lolita, was more interesting than the middle or end. I also got really tired of translating French words, phrases, and paragraphs. That may reflect more on me than the auhor, but in any case, I'm glad I finally finished it."

5,Camila Shimada,33,32,"Después de mucho pensarlo...creo que lo calificaré con 2 estrellas. A pesar de que el argumento me llamaba mucho la atención, y a ratos quedaba muy pegada, en general no conseguí engancharme con todo y quizás eso se debió a la forma de narrar del protagonista, demasiado difusa y retorcida a ratos (no retorcida de enferma xD sino que daba muchas vueltas, y comentaba mucho y eso me hacía perder el hilo de lo que estaba leyendo)Confieso que lo leí de morbosa nomás; la historia de un Hombre treintón que por un trauma de su niñez se siente atraído por las púberes y termina enamorándose de Lolita, la hija de la loca que le arrienda un cuarto. Es bastante sutil para narrar, porque perfectamente lo podría haber hecho pornográfico y contar detalles pero no lo hizo, y a mi opinión me gustó que siempre se viera el punto de vista del protagonista. Humbert explica todos sus actos, de forma que parece bastante lógica, pero aún así hay cosas que no dejan de ser...tenebrosas en el sentido que se metió igual con una cabra chica de 12 años y que le robó su niñez xD independiente de que ella fuera despierta. Sin embargo, dentro de todo el trastorno del loco, igual deja entrever su cariño y preocupación. En fin, no creo que lo lea de nuevo :/"
5,Firyal Maulia,34,33,"Vulgar, detail, detailnya yang bikin menjijikan. yucks"
5,Matthew,39,38,"I had imagined Lolita as a twisted love story, but it really is more of a tale of addiction and more specifically obsession. Humbert Humbert's journals are very personal, which makes for shocking and vile literature, but I feel that Nabokov didn't dive into Humbert's pschy deep enough for me. However, I would recommend the book just simply in order to experience Nabokov's brilliant play with words. "
5,Kendra Powers,42,41,"slow at parts, but eloquently worded for a book about a pedophile and his nymphet"
5,Sean Costello,43,42,"Lolita is a strange mixture of great writing and appalling subject matter. I found the writing style of this book to be enjoyable, and very well done. However, from a content perspective, it is quite a horrific novel. Humbert Humbert (whom I shall refer to as HH) is a pedophile who proceeds to invade the life of a woman so that he can take advantage of her daughter Dolores. When Dolores' mother dies, HH essentially kidnaps her and brings her across the country, doing whatever he pleases to her along the way. Dolores manages to 'escape' from HH with Clare Quilty, a truly monstrous man who lives in a way reminiscent of the film Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom. Ending with HH giving Dolores all the money he has left and killing Clare Quilty.As a character, HH is a tragic individual. An abnormal man who does unspeakable things to children, yet is repulsed by vulgar language? He does comes across as almost likable in some instances, and to be genuinely in love with Dolores towards the end. His character is where I find the story to be intentionally conflicting for the reader, Nabokov introduces HH's pedophilia right from the get go so it is always in the readers mind. No matter what HH does that can be seen as a positive in the story, you can never actually approve of him as a human being because of his disgusting acts. Towards the end of the story, HH seems to be trying to atone for his sins by keeping his perversions under control, providing the monetary means for Dolores and her husband to start their new life, and destroying Clare Quilty (a man far worse than HH). However the fiendish acts he commits through out this story outweigh any and all 'good' he does. Though try as he might, there is no redemption for the things he has done.The narration of this story was really quite interesting and for me the part I enjoyed the most. HH's self-awareness made for a different experience then most novels. He is a clearly sick individual, as you can tell by his bouts of madness evident by his writing throughout the story. Nabokov's use of 'unreliable narrator' also makes the read amusing, not being able to believe everything said with 100% confidence. I did, however, find this novel to be fairly repetitious. Some parts felt like I had read them 4 or 5 times previously and really seemed to be more filler than anything. Overall I thought that Lolita was an alright novel. With, unfortunately, nothing in particular that made it stand out to me as being one of the classics it is revered as, I thought it was just.. odd."

5,David Davy,48,47,"Much like Ross and Rachael, Sam and Diane, or even Jerry and Elaine, comedic tension and entertainment value goes downhill after Humbert Humbert achieves his goals. If this is because I am not an astute or patient enough reader, so be it.Or maybe it was the fact that we both have the same name twice that hit a little too close to home."

5,Emily Carpenter,57,56,"I know I was only supposed to write a review for one book for Part One of my Senior Institute Homework. However this book was terrible, awful, and depressing. The writing was poignant and used language in an intruiging way. However although I'm all for free speach by the end of about the 3rd chapter I wanted to destroy the book. The main character almost gets into your mind, and is almost asking you to sympathize with his atrocities. Furthermore because of all the detail from the first character, it made me wonder if the author was writing from personal experience. I definitely do not want to read this book again. "

5,Kaethe,61,60,"As a college freshman I loved this. But the older I get, the more repulsive it becomes to me."
5,Kelsi,64,63,"A difficult read, hard to follow what was actually going on. Seeing everything through the eyes of a pedophile was also rather disturbing. It was unsettling knowing that people like this actually exist. Felt especially horrified when Humbert actually drugged 'Lolita' and essentially raped her. Not sure what one could learn from this book... except that pedophilia and kidnapping is wrong... "
5,Johanna,72,71,Disturbing--I couldn't bring myself to continue after reading half way.
5,Charity,73,72,"So the book is eloquently written. Some sentences are beautifully lyrical - and for that I give it two stars. HOWEVER, the actually story is really, really icky and I give that zero stars. I knew what the story was about before getting into the book, but I would have never imagined how much I would cringe and think ""ew"" while I was reading it. Yep - ew. Ew ew ew! Just ew."

5,Olga,78,77,"For most this book gets a 5/5, and I think the writing is exceptional, I do, but it still just sits strangely within me. I still think about it, though I read it years ago, and that too says something. So I want to give it a higher rating, but just can't, though I think Nabokov is incredible, this is where it stands with me. "
5,Filomena,80,79,"Finally finished! Two and a half star. Vážně nevím, co víc říct. Příběh byl pěkný, poutavý, sem tam zajímavé přirovnání, ale. Děsně rozvlekle napsané se spoustou popisů, které děj rozvolňovaly až se stával nudným či nepřehledným. Kdyby neměla knížka 319 stran, ale jen půlku, dostala by hvězdiček daleko víc. Je mi líto, ale tahle klasika mě prostě moc neuchvátila."
5,Mohar,81,80,A very controversial subject indeed. Tried empathizing with the author by somehow can't relate to such a relationship. The language is simply great.
5,Tim Cronin,82,81,"The problem with Lolita is that no matter how beautiful the prose, and it is, is that not everybody desires to sit through 300+ pages detailing Humbert's yearning to, among other things, have sex with a 12 yr old. It may be great writing, but that doesn't mean it's a pleasure to read, so it defeated the point for me. Honestly, I couldn't wait until it was over so I could move on to something else. But to each their own."
5,Tricia Long,83,82,"Great writing, but I couldn't get past the terrible things happening in the novel. Wish I could have, it was so beautifully written and translated."

5,Arsen Zahray,85,84,"The book is ok at best. The author's writing style is interesting, and he argues persuasively that it's not a really bad thing to have sex with teenagers/children. I concur. In my opinion, what he did wrong was rather having an abusive and controlling relationship with another person. Which is not rare. For some reason, this book is really famous. I honestly can't see, why."
5,Tessa,87,86,Half enjoyed. Why do people name their kids after this book?
5,Cheylianie,90,89,"I thought I would enjoy this book, I was wrong. I know it's a classic, but what can I say? It didn't capture me. Maybe I'll go back to it later in my life."
5,Redgeorgiadawg,95,94,I hate to say that I read this book. I'm glad I read it before I was the mother of two small children. I can't imagine they feelings it would evoke at this stage of my life. I wanted to heave it across the room at times. It was ok. The writing style very specific to this author. Great discussion if you can stomach the subject matter. 
5,Lori,96,95,"I did a google search ""why is Lolita considered a classic?"" Read a few blurbs, but not sure I agree. Some reviewers said if you read it twice, you're more likely to ""get it"" and because the second time you're less shocked by the pedophilia. Well written but...eh..."

5,Caitlin Trepp,100,99,This book was really hard to read due to the wordiness and subject matter. I followed along as I read with Sparkpeople but I didn't feel the connection. I don't feel how this book is really elevated to the level of classic literature.

Hard to pick up again. "
5,Kat,105,104,"This is an excellent book which I can't stand, because it does far too good a job of getting into the mind of a pedophile. I can't read it without feeling disgusting; my body shivers with the chills of his descriptions of little girls. I don't have any sympathy for Humbert Humbert, and I'm not sure that you can. I know many people respect and critique Lolita, but it simply is too creepy to read. "
5,Jacqueline,110,109,"""Лолита"" - ами, сложна работа. Роман, който ми бе изключително трудно да харесам... и същевременно да не харесам. Това е първият ми сблъсък с Набоков, от чийто талант съм впечатлена- дарбата на този човек да пише толкова изящно бе единственият ми стимул да не захвърля книгата още в самото ѝ начало. Често почти забравях отвращението си от Х.Х. заради очарователните му (на моменти почти поетични) монолози. Например един тенис мач- нещо толкова обикновено и нормално, Набоков шлифова по неузнаваем начин, разигравайки го през погледа- или по-скоро през сърцето- на Х.Х.:Преди сервиса, преди да се задействува, Лолита сякаш си поемаше дъх, престояваше два-три такта отвъд бялата черта и при това понякога тупваше веднъж или дваж топката или с връхчето на бялата си обувчица чукваше веднъж-дваж по земята, винаги се държеше волно, винаги си оставаше спокойно весела — тя, която рядко би ваше весела в тягостната за нея домашна обстановка! Според мен играта й на тенис представляваше най-високата точка, до която едно младо същество може да издигне сценичното изкуство, макар че за нея вероятно това представляваше само геометрична същност на основната й житейска действителност.Изящната яснота на движенията й намираше слухово допълнение в чистия, стегнат звън на всеки неин удар. Щом попаднеше в аурата на нейната власт, топката ставаше по-бяла, пъргавината й качествено по-скъпоценна. Прецизният инструмент, който тя употребяваше, изглеждаше в мига на гальовния допир невероятно точен и спокоен. Нещо повече: стилът й беше съвсем вярна имитация на най-първокласен тенис, лишен обаче в ръцете й от каквито и да било практически резултати. Както ми каза Електра Голд, сестрата на Едуза, изумителната млада треньорка, когато веднъж седях на коравата пейка, започнала да пулсира под мен, и гледах как Долорес Хейз без усилие разтяга по целия корт миловидната Линда Хол (която впрочем я победи): „Вашата Доли има монтиран магнит за топката точно в средата на ракетата, но ей богу, защо е толкова учтива?“ Ах, Електра, защо не — при такава грация! Помня, когато присъствувах при играта им, почувствувах как поглъщането на тази красота буквално ме облива с едва поносими тръпки. Моята Лолита имаше навика леко да повдига полусвит в коляното ляв крак при размаха, и пружинирането в началото на цикъла сервиси, когато се развиваше и за миг се изопваше в лъчите на слънцето живата равновесна мрежа между четирите точки — поантата на този крак, едва обвитата в мъх подмишница, загорялата ръка и далеч назад отметнатият овал на ракетата, докато тя извръщаше блесналите зъбки на усмихнатата си уста нагоре към малката планета, увиснала толкова високо в зенита на силния и строен космос, създаден от нея с определена цел — да го нападне със звучен плясък на златния си камшик. Подаването й беше прямо, красиво, младо, с класически чиста траектория, но въпреки бързото й темпо не беше мъчно да й се върне, защото нямаше нищо измамно или умишлено в продължителния подскок на топката й. За да бъда напълно честна обаче- сюжетът ми се стори меко казано отвратителен. И да, това ми субективно мнение изобщо не ми попречи да осмисля художествената стойност на книгата/ да оценя посланията, които носи/ да взема предвид времето и обстановката, в което е писана/ и т.н., и т.н. С елегантната си, фина, чувствителна натура, Х.Х. не ми стана по-малко противен. Бях чела някъде, че ""A gentleman is simply a patient wolf."" В ""Лолита"" видях ужасната деградация на този ""patient wolf"" от gentle до mental. И не, за разлика от останалите вдъхновени, умилени, прекланящи се etc. читатели, не изпитвам и капчица състрадание към Х.Х. Твърде тънка ми се струва границата между изпепеляваното му от сбъркана любов сърце и умопомрачения му, болен мозък. Самият Набоков споделя следното в тази връзка:В една свободна страна, разбира се, никой истински писател не е задължен да тегли черта къде свършва чувството и почва чувствеността. Романът ми има доста препратки към физиологичните нагони на извратения човек — не мога да отрека това.(...) именно сцените, в които празният безделник би съзрял разпасана чувственост, всъщност представляват конструктивно необходим елемент за развитието на трагичното повествование в неотклонното му движение към онова, което единствено може да бъде наречено морален апотеоз.Образа на самата Лолита все още не мога да подложа на окончателна ""присъда"". Тя си е просто дете- и ми се струва, че не трябва да я виня, въпреки масата обвинения, които прочетох, че всъщност тя е тази, която е прелъстила ""бедния"" Х.Х. Трябва да се запозная с повече критика (и коментари от самия Набоков), за да си избистря още някои моменти около полюсното ѝ - ту плашещо зряло, ту стряскащо детинско поведение.В общи линии, не бих могла да обобщя мнението си за ""Лолита"" по-добре от казаното в самия предговор на романа: Отчаяната честност, която искри в изповедта му, ни най-малко не го освобождава от отговорност заради дяволската му изобретателност. Той е ненормален. Той не е джентълмен. Но колко магично пеещата му цигулка поражда у нас нежно състрадание към Лолита, кара ни да се увличаме от книгата въпреки отвращението си към автора! Приятни цитати от книгата, мъничко доказателство за нежния ""размах"" на Набоков:Всичко това е много интересно и допускам, че вече виждате как се разпенва устата ми пред припадък — обаче не, нищо не се разпенва, просто издухвам разноцветни мехурчета от щастливи мисли в съответната чашка.***Чувствах, че животът ми има нужда от някакъв потрес.***Явно бе от жените, чиито полирани думи могат да отразят дамски читателски кръжец или дамски кръжец за бридж, но душата не могат да отразят; жените, лишени напълно от чувство за хумор, всъщност напълно безразлични към тези десет-дванайсет теми за салонен разговор, които са им достъпни, но твърде придирчиви към правилата на разговора, през слънчевия целофан, на който ясно избиват стаени, потискани и немного апетитни неща.***oгледах я през мъглата на отказа си***и сетне без никакво предупреждение под сърцето ми набъбна синя морска вълна***„Ces matins gris si doux…“***Все пак този четвъртък бе запазил за мен капчица мед в жълъдовото си калпаче.***Докато наблюдавах това със самостоятелната яснота на бъдещия спомен (също както гледаш нещата с усилието да ги видиш такива, каквито ще си ги спомняш по-късно)...***И през цялото време усещах малкия си индивидуален пожар вдясно от мен: тържествуващото й око, пламналата й буза.***„Ах, прости ми, душице моя, моя ултравиолетова душице — казах аз и напразно се мъчех да уловя нейния лакът; а понеже исках да сменя разговора — да сменя прицела на съдбата, боже мой, боже мой (...)***Разбира се, ще се боря.

(...) Разпределили сме всичко това по графи и колкото по-рядко виждаме дадено лице, толкова по-приятно ни е да се убедим при всяко негово споменаване, че той послушно следва представите ни за него.

There were some points where the polt was strong and intriguing and Nabokov's poetic prose style was very nice to read sometimes. On the other hand, though, our protagonist Humbert Humbert spends what seems like eternities doting on Lolita and describing ad nauseum the details of young ""nymphet"" and their relationship.One of the classics, but one you should probably only pick up if you have a stomach for gross overdescription and doting and can get by with only snatches of intense plot here and there.*-This was the Just For Fun Book Group's selection for August 2010, nominated by me.*-This is #4 on The Modern Library's 100 Best Novels."
5,Irene,118,117,"I read the Indonesian translation. It was awful... Then I got bored trying to emphathize the main character personality. Yeah man, whatever. I had to put down the book many times and sighed... And then I found it more interesting and motivating to try to understand Lolita's personality. That's how I kept going and finished the book. More likable, since I met many pedophile victims in my work. Still, this book doesn't make me forgive pedophiles easily. Not even a tiny bit more. "

5,Ana Clara,126,125,"I read this as fast as I could, I wanted to get it over with. As soon as I started reading I knew I had probably made a mistake, and this book wasn't for me. I kept reading because everyone talks about how great the writing is [it's good, but nothing much, in my opinion (I did read a translation, and who knows? maybe it was a bad one)]. I read because I wanted to know what happened to Dolores, and I just don't like DNF'ing books.I don't understand why people like this book. I get that it's not the SUBJECT that they like, but the writing, the way it's put together, and etc. I've read some reviews explaining, but I still don't get it. I saw none of what they talk about (again, maybe the translation. Maybe my head was too clouded with disgust: for what was hapening, for the way Humbert blames it on everyone but himself, for how he tries to portray himself as some hero just because he was so against actually having sex with the girl because she was just ""so pure"", for how he takes advantage of her vulnerabilities, for how he thinks he's better than the other older guys who look at her, for how he romanticizes this relationship that is everything but romantic, for how he keeps making her travel with him as to not get too involved with anyone else, for how he gives her money if she does certain things, etc. I could keep going for ages).It's weird, because I don't really feel like making a long review. Usually, when I don't like books, I have thousands of things to say, but with this one, I'd rather just not say it, or not say too much. I'm sure it's been said before, by people with more knowledge and control of the english language than me. Let's just say it made me very uncomfortable, it made me wonder all the time why was it even written, and why it was some people's favorite book. Leave it at that."

He stays in a small town where he rents a room owned by Charlotte Haze who has a 12 year old daughter, Dolores aka Lolita. Humbert immediately becomes infatuated with the young girl and plots to have her all to himself.I've had this book for around five years now. I tried to read it when I was 15 but I found it quite hard to read, not for its content, but just the language and the way it's written. So coming back to it now, not much has really changed. I am in two minds about it, I found it incredibly hard to read yet I thought it was an interesting plot. There were times when I found the style of writing to be beautiful and then I'd just get lost again and think, ""What the hell is going on here? Is this part of the story or what?' I found that I couldn't wait to find out what happens next which is always a good thing.As I said, I mostly found it hard to read but I also found the characters to be extremely irritating. Lolita is such an annoying little harlot, Humbert slightly psychotic and delusional and the rest of the characters are just blah. Rather than give this review one stars, I gave it two because of the general plot."
5,Iceman,139,138,"Lolita, luz da minha vida, fogo da minha virilidade, meu pecado, minha alma. Lo-li-ta"".Assim se inicia um dos romances mais polémicos de sempre e aquele que marcou toda a carreira literária de Vladimir Nabokov.Nabokov nasceu em 1899 na cidade russa de San Petersburgo no seio da aristocracia. Em 1919, devido à Revoilução Bolchevique, a sua família é obrigada a abandonar a Rússia, refugiando-se em Inglaterra. Nabokov matricula-se então na famosa universidade de Cambridge onde se licencia em 1922 em literatura russa e francesa. A partir daí, Nabokov saltita de lugar para lugar. Primeiro Berlim, depois Paris e em 1940 e para fugir aos nazis, parte para os Estados Unidos da América, onde se dedica a leccionar literatura russa, além de trabalhar em tradução de livros e no departamento de entomologia de Harvard.Profundamente pedante, chegando mesmo a afirmar: ""penso como um génio, escrevo como um autor distinto e falo como uma criança"", Nabokov desprezava escritores que, segundo ele, escreviam literatura ideológica e politicamente correcta. Assim odiava escritores como Thomas Mann, Balzac, Dostoievski, Gorki e Kafka, dizendo insolentemente deste último que a sua obra ""Metamorfose"" era um excelente livro de dissecação de insectos... Em suma, tinha fama de misantropo, a mania da superioridade e era completamente intratável, ou seja, e digo eu, era um completo Palhaço!E pergunto: Como é que este senhor consegue escrever uma obra que é considerada como um dos clássicos da literatura?Mas após a leitura deste livro, entendi porquê.Como classificar Lolita? Narrado em jeito de memórias, uma forma que torna sempre uma história credível, ""Lolita"" é uma trágica confissão de Humbert Humbert, o protagonista-narrador, que na prisão e antes de enfrentar um julgamento por homicídio, resolve contar as suas memórias em relação ao grande amor da sua vida. Narrado sempre na primeira pessoa, ""Lolita"" é um conto chocante que descreve os pensamentos e acções de um pedófilo.Humbert é um pedófilo. Tem 42 anos, europeu, professor de literatura inglesa que, depois de algumas aventuras amorosas na Europa, chega à América com o intuito de apagar o seu passado no velho continente. Acaba por se instalar numa pequena cidade onde aluga um quarto em casa de uma viúva quarentona chamada Charlotte Haze, que tem uma filha ainda criança: Lolita, 12 anos.Nessa altura e devido aos seus pensamentos, apercebemo-nos que Humbert gosta de crianças a quem ele chama de ninfetas e percebemos, dentro do possível, o porquê dessa paranóia.Mas Humbert começa a desejar Lolita, pensamentos libidinosos começam a percorrer a sua mente. Só pensa nela e imagina-se já envolvido com ela. Posteriormente Humbert apercebe-se duma inclinação de Mrs. Haze em relação a ele e, é precisamente através desse casamento que ele se aproxima de vez de Lolita, pois passa a ter “poderes” sobre ela enquanto padrasto.A narrativa segue o seu pervertido rumo com alguma sensualidade e humor, no entanto o tomo é sempre chocante, a paixão de Humbert é avassaladora, doentia, obsessiva. É curioso o pormenor com que Nabokov analisa a mente de Humbert. Ele efectua um exame profundo da mente do pedófilo, inquietando-nos com o que extraí, as conclusões vai-nos chocando, ferindo e é impressionante o seguinte contra-senso: tem a capacidade de nos convencer que a pedófilia pode não ser tão aberrante, tão doentia como podemos julgar, podendo mesmo ser uma forma de amor. É impressionante mas é verdade. Nabokov joga literalmente connosco, com os nossos preconceitos, com os nossos medos e, depois de entregar o jogo, volta a tirar as cartas e baralha novamente. Repara-se que ele atinge o auge do chocante e do aberrante quando descreve os diários e sucessivos abusos (quase violações) de Humbert a Lolita, [que diga-se também de passagem, não era nenhuma ingénua ""colegial"" de 12 anos] Humbert deseja até engravidar Lolita para que pudesse dar à luz uma ninfeta, para, obviamente, futuro deleite de Humbert. É asqueroso! Mas depois Nabokov dá completamente a volta a este sentimento.Mas será ""Lolita"" um simples livro erótico, pedófilo, pornográfico ou psicológico?Claro que não!Este livro é escrito com um objectivo.Nabokov (um autêntico palhaço) odiava Freud (o homem devia odiar toda a gente), considerava-o um bacoco primitivo que falava por clichés e sem pingo de inteligência. Assim criticava a psicanálise e a psicologia e este livro é simplesmente uma paródia a estas duas ciências. No livro, Humbert (Nabokov) goza com os psicólogos, indo ao ponto de afirmar que inventava sonhos para os psicólogos descodificarem. A forma como Humbert vai narrando os acontecimentos, os seus impulsos sexuais, a sua obsessão por crianças, é notoriamente uma paródia a Freud e à sua psicanálise. Existem também uma série de enigmas presentes em todo o texto, assim como frases com segundo sentido. No romance surge uma personagem feminina que se chama Vivian Darkbloom que é um anagrama de Vladimir Nabokov, ou seja, um autêntico jogo criado por alguém que era mestre de xadrez e que pretendeu fazer deste livro um género de quebra-cabeças. E repare-se que afirmo que isto pelo que fui lendo sobre a obra, porque eu próprio não dei conta de alguns pormenores que afirmam estarem lá colocados estrategicamente.Independentemente de quaisquer considerações sobre esta obra, independentemente daqueles que afirmam ser este livro uma obra de arte escrito de uma forma genial, eu vejo-o como um livro onde um escritor arrogante brinca e manipula, brilhantemente é um facto, o leitor. Um livro onde o escritor mandas às malvas simples regras éticas e humanas, descrevendo a mente nojenta de um pedófilo com uma finalidade objectiva: Chocar e achincalhar outros personagens destacados doa sociedade da altura.Por isso, para mim, Nabokov foi um palhaço! "
5,Jami,142,141,"Hard to get through, I now know why this was a ""banned"" book. Yucky"
5,Leona Storey,143,142,"  “Words without experience are meaningless.”  This isn’t going to be a nice review. I’ve never been happier to have finished a book - not because it was good or anything, but because I’m so goddamn glad I never have to read any of Humbert Humberts’ words again or hear his stupid, over-the-top story. Christ, first of all, I just want to say, has Nabokov ever heard of this thing called a paragraph? One of his paragraphs lasted two flippin’ pages (I’m trying not to swear here - I really dislike this book). Two pages!!! Who does that? Upon seeing it, I physically groaned and shut the book. I couldn’t be bothered for it.Humberts’ endlessly descriptive narrative was so tiresome and unnecessary. It made the story so hard to follow. The last couple of chapters were practically unreadable, I had no idea what was going on. Revisiting places of something or other, and then a really misplaced crime that felt like it had been stuffed in there because Nabokov realised that 100 pages of his book had no relevance and he was trying to make me care for his perverted and boring story.Honestly, a book about a paedophile’s obession with the twelve year old Lolita should be way more interesting than it was. Not in a sick way, but that sort of topic is something that 99% of writers wouldn’t dare touch with a bargepole, so of course you are naturally intrigued to see how someone writes about it - but never was I so disappointed. He started so well, and had me going well for about 100 pages, but after that it was so… pffft.Perhaps I’m not clever enough to appreciate this book, though I can say without a doubt that Nabokov is an interesting and skilled writer, he just didn’t execute this well enough. And knowing that English is his third or fourth language, it is some flawless writing. (He knows more words than I do!)Besides all this, I feel like the reason this book was banned in the first place wasn’t because of the disturbing subject, but because it was pure and utter drivilling crap. "
5,Brett Mullane,144,143,"The book has its moments mostly in the first half, but overall this book is repetitive, self-serving rubbish. Can't recommend to anyone. "
5,Danielle Allen,146,145,"I wanted to like this book. Nabokov's prose is eloquent and I really enjoyed his storytelling style. However, I just couldn't get over my disgust for the protagonist, a proud pedophile. It took me an incredibly amount of time to finish this book, considering its length, because I had to keep walking away from the book because I found it so disturbing. It would literally bother me for the rest of the day after reading certain sections. Even though I know the book is fictional, I still keep thinking of poor Lolita and everything she went through, and I feel sick knowing that there are people out there like Humbert who have no real self awareness and understanding of the impact of their actions. "
5,Jim Krotzman,147,146,"After reading Lolita, I felt dirty as I did after reading Naked Lunch by William Burroughs and Tropic of Cancer by Henry Miller."
5,Kirsty,148,147,I understand why this book has effected the literacy world in the way it had. The book is written beautifully and poetically. It explores lust in the rawest form and introduces a topic which is rarely spoken about. I appreciate the book for the boundaries it has broken conceptually however found the book too over powering with the use of constant metaphors and in depth descriptions. I struggle to move forward and grasp everything that Lolita represents. 2 and a half stars for me.
5,Paula Laureano,150,149,"I was really enjoying reading this book until I got to half of it. I was laughing of Humbert Humbert. He was an interesting character. He is mentally ill, but he doesn't know it. The reader follows his ups and downs while he tries to achieve his goal. And he is sarcastic! And its kinda fun. But everything changes when he achieves his goal. It gets disgusting. And boring. And made me stop reading the book. "

Or maybe it's just me.I know several people who love this book, and I kind of see why if we're just talking about the way Nabokov crafts characters who are so flawed and are incredibly gifted at explaining away their flaws. But the plot creeps me out, so much so that while I would re-read it to try and figure out what gets people all fired up about this book, it's going to take me a while to reach that point."
5,Tien,166,165,"I've always been hesitant in picking up this book noting the subject matter. However, it is a classic and seems to be one of the great lit works so it must be worth it to read. It is quite a bit different from my expectation. I really didn't expect 'Lolita' to be who she is and I... DON'T... LIKE... HER. Since I like neither characters, it's really not a book that I favor at all. Still, I have to admit that I do like the ending - what Lolita becomes, Humbert's revenge, etc. I'm not very good at appreciating literary works, I only go with what I feel when I read so therefore, the rating this book earned. If I didn't like the ending, I'd probably only give this book 1 star."
5,Vinay Kumar,168,167,"Writing style is good but otherwise it seems to be pornographic material, still a good read."
5,Afsheen,169,168,Finally done. 
5,Tami Gandt,170,169,I didn't see the appeal of this book. It took me forever to finish. 
5,Terhura Bankston,173,172,"Although Nabakov is a brilliant writer, this book was a hard read. "
5,Michael  Malone ,176,175,"Very surprised by how dull this book was. I'm still unsure what exactly the plot is, and why we should care about either Humbert Squared or Lo--both are sniveling, self-absorbed and a bit hard to root for, while one of them is, of course, an incurable child molester. Nabakov drops the ball in terms of showing Lo's reaction to the death of her mom, and the final scene involving Quilty is a mess. Its saving grace--despite being a complete arse, Humbert is funny: funny in the way your bitchy, snarky, sarcastic friend is funny...in doses. "
5,Gabriel Thy,177,176,"This book is serially over-rated as anything beyond the literary culture vulture set, but then again, this is not 1950s USA. The topic is shocking. The psychological profile of a wife-murdering child molester is hardly the stuff of tea room chatter, but it does hold true to the test of groundbreaking literature when even a few women in Tehran find the revolutionary air worth breathing... "
5,Jonny Amalgamated,178,177,"Alright... So I only got 49% of the way through it, but I'm done."
5,Jossalyn,179,178,"unpleasant story, unpleasant characters, hard to read around this and the self-conscious self appreciation of the author.first read in 1982"
5,Kadivs,180,179,"This book was an excercise in boredness. The first 3/5 of the book are really just boring. Over about 100 pages he meets lolita, then spends about 200 pages just traveling around the US with her without anything worth mentioning happening. Just traveling around, some descriptions of the hotels they stay in, some descriptions of activities they did (going to the cinema, playing a match of tennis etc), nothing else.The second part of the book starts out like this as well, but it picks up a bit at around page 300. Then it's actually kind of interesting until the book ends at page 500. If it continued like the part before, it would have been a guaranteed 1 star.The rest, 200 feaking pages, are nothing but several epilogues/afterwords. I haven't read them yet and am not sure if I ever will, but how narcissistic does an author have to be to spend 2/7 (nearly a third) of his book just talking about how he wrote it? Granted, it may be that this part also contains some texts by critics or other authors, I don't know, but still, 200 pages, WTF.I can only recommend this book for people who like to be bored to tears (I fell into microsleep several times while reading it, it's really that boring) or those who like to overionterpret stuff, because this book is ripe with ""symbols"".How this book could ever get so ""big"" I don't know. Probably just because a pedofile as the protagonist was really controversial.I also suspect that most people here on goodreads that actually give this book a positive rating either diddn't read it and/or did it for the same reason people buy books just to fill their bookshelfes without ever reading them (or the reason people buy ""modern art""), that is, to look sophisticated. I bet the people tought ""hey, this book is famous, it's world literature, if I don't give it a favorable rating, people will think I'm a yokel!"".Sure, I may be wrong with that and in some cases someone honestly liked it, but still, I just can't imagine someone actually enjoyed reading that book. I just can't."
5,Sandra Shergill,181,180,"Beautifully written and even funny in places, but it's hard to like any character and its easy to hate Humbert Humbert for his hideous cravings, arrogance and sense of entitlement. "
5,A. E. S.,183,182,"For all its contrived hype on its sexuality, the book is not very sexual at all, nor is it exciting. Humbert is very human but also an extremely dull, cowardly man. Lolita is who she is without knowing what exactly it is she's doing or its consequences, in other words she obscenely retains her innocence even as she is having intercourse with a man twice her age."
5,Sunil,187,186,"The book is written as a memoir of the author recounting his life and in particular his relationships. It is quite disturbing as the author is a pervert. The prose involves the use of very long sentences and such flowery language that it is quite often difficult to tell what exactly the author is talking about. The language is very poetic, however, and this does fit with the passionate tale the author is telling. Definitely worth a read if only to marvel at the use of the english language and at how infatuated one can get whilst in love. I found the interspersed use of french throughout the novel annoying."
5,Book Worm,189,188,"Creepy and scary! A nightmare! This book scared the living daylights out of me. As a parent, I loathed Humbert's very existence and hated the book as a consequence!"
5,Kalle,190,189,"I have to say that for the most part this book was simply boring. I understand what it perhaps tried to achieve: to characterise the main character, but his inner dialogue and endless ramblings got old rather quickly."
5,Surendra Dighe,191,190, a story of a insane.Experienced a different type of reading.
5,Chloe,194,193,This should have been a short story. Vladimir Nabokov is revoltingly arrogant and self-satisfied.
5,Rhonda Nelson,195,194,"I hate this book. Hate it! If I never hear or read the word “nymphet” again, it will be too soon. Glorified pedophilia is not for me. I stuck with it though because it is on my “Must Read Classics” list. Blah. The only redeeming quality was that I listened to it as an audiobook and Jeremy Irons was inspired reading as Humbert Humbert."
5,Adrielle Pottle,196,195,"Disturbing, disgusting and ridiculous. Praised for what I ask? For having a pedophiles in it? Seriously, it baffles me what people find as good literature. Utterly pathetic. Yes this is only my opinion but there is no way on earth I'd recommend this to a soul, classic or not. This was a set reading for me at uni, otherwise I would have never read it and who knows, maybe that has something to do with my distaste. I doubt it though."
5,Sirine,201,200,"The plot of the book is really interesting, because it was a new idea to me. I thought it to be creative and bold.But the problem however was in my comprehension of the book since English is not my native language and the author used an elaborate style of writing. This has sometimes caused me problems in understanding what was happening in the story which frustrated me. But I'm sure that if had understood more, I would've liked it even better.Not to forget that H.H and Dolores can both be really frustrating at some points, plus the narration gets boring very often.Their relationship is also very disturbing and H.H is a man of many issues who should seek help.I think I'll try to read it again in a couple of years when my English has improved and when I've forgotten how much it bored me and dragged to end."

""Allí está, no reconocida e ignorante de su fantástico poder.""

Lolita es un clásico que tenía muchas ganas de leer y sin embargo no me sedujo.Empezando con el personaje principal y narrador, Humbert Humbert, a quién odie profundamente.Entiendo que es solo su punto de vista lo que nos cuenta, pero siento que él solo quería saciar su deseo con un personaje prácticamente inventado en su cabeza, sin importarle nada más que eso, ni siquiera lo que pensaba o sentía la propia Lolita. (view spoiler)[Aunque, menos mal, casi al final se da cuenta de sus errores y los admite:""Ahora, hurgando en mi memoria, recuerdo que en esa ocasión como otras similares, mi costumbre era ignorar los estados de alma de Lolita y consolar a mi propia alma vil.""
 (hide spoiler)]La narración me gustó, pero tiene demasiadas descripciones, cosa que al principio no me molestaba, pero una parte en la mitad del libro es solo eso: descripciones y nada de acción, entonces llegó aburrirme mucho.

""Lo bestial y lo hermoso se juntaban en un punto.""

Yo pensé que iba a encontrarme un personaje que me iba a quedar grabado por mucho tiempo, pero sin embargo, no le encontré nada especial a Lolita. Para mi solo fue un personaje sufrido que deseaba tener una vida normal, nada más.Sé que es una obra para analizar muy profundamente, pero sino logra cautivarte no hay nada que hacer, y a mi no logró hacerlo.

5,Víctor Gutiérrez,207,206,La premisa es buena pero el libro es muy aburrido.
5,Jennifer Rayment,209,208,"Mini Book Review: This was a constant struggle for me to get through. I basically would read a chapter a day and that was about all I could handle. It is extremely well written and Nabokov had a brilliant way of describing even the littlest thing so well that you could close your eyes and see it. It is also a book that can lead to some passionate discussions. That being said, I truly did not like it. The characters were reprehensible, the subject matter depressing and icky and it just went on and on. As with most classics there is detailed character development and flowery descriptions which are not to my particular tastes. I like a good story, makes me less of an intellect I know, but I am not going to be something I am obviously not. At least I can say I read it and can discuss it in greater detail -- but I can guarantee you I will not be reading it again.1.5 Dewey's (Based on my enjoyment of it NOT the talents of the author)I read this because it was part of my BBC Top 100 Challenge. I borrowed this copy from Sheridan College (Through Inter-library Loan -- Love my job). Guys one of these days I am buying you a new copy - this copy was published in 1970 -- and so was I - and like me its old and not in the best of shape"
5,Loren,214,213,"Read it out of curiosity, not my kind of book though."
5,Rochelle,215,214,"It took me three months, and about five books in between, to get through this rambling hot mess of a book. I appreciate Nabokov's style, and will admit to reading some of his prose passages that I thought were pure delightful, but so much of the narrative was bloated and excessive. The book opened strong, and I liked the literary device of framing it as a memoir, but the subject didn't enthral me and characters were flat. To be clear, however, I wasn't disengaged because I was prudishly taken aback by the subject matter. If that were the case, I would have had more of reaction than indifference and apathy. No, I was simply bored, and am still puzzling how the good folks at Vanity Fair called it, ""The only convincing love story of our century."" I could name a hundred more convincing than Lolita."
5,Dorottya Szabó,216,215,"I experienced the difference between reading a good storyteller and reading a good story. And he also wasn't a great character (well, he was but that is not the point), the way he writes is great. And how he acknowledges all thoe thing he didn't know or just told himself to believe! But it didn't connected with a great story it could be just some practice for him. I don't know, still i really enjoyed it. "

5,Sofia,221,220,"Lolita is extremely well written, however the subject matter was too much for me to enjoy this read at all. "
5,Lua Limaverde,222,221,"Ao dar duas estrelas para um clássico como esse sinto-me como se estivesse ofendendo as pessoas que amam o livro ou ofendendo a mim mesma, como se eu não tivesse sensibilidade para entender a beleza do livro. No entanto não posso fugir do fato de que minha leitura foi penosa. E não foi penosa como eu pensei que seria devido ao tema, foi penosa porque não me envolvi, porque a bela escrita não foi suficiente para me prender, para me conquistar e olha que até gosto de uma história em que quase nada acontece e a escrita é o que se sobressai.Lembrei-me de O Colecionador, de John Fowles, uma história semelhante em que o narrador também é um homem obsessivo, egocêntrico e cruel e neste eu senti tudo que pensei que iria sentir ao ler Lolita: repulsa pelo personagem mas uma vontade irresistível de continuar lendo. No livro de Nabokov eu não via a hora de tudo acabar, mesmo não dando muito importância a como iria acabar. Uma pena que não tenha funcionado pra mim."
5,carl  theaker,223,222," Had to read for Contemporary Lit and while I liked many books in the class, this one didn't catch on with me. "
5,Alyssaluca,226,225,"This book for me was a difficult one to read. The the first part of the story (the part where Charlotte was married to Humbert) wasn't bad, as I felt there was something to read next, and that I was waiting for the big reveal of Humbert's secret love affair for their daughter. But no! It happened, she died, it was dramatic, and I'll say that was great. But the rest of the book bored me (and that was the majority of the book). It could be that I am only 14, and the description in this book lost me many times, so there's the chance I'm just too young for the book. It droned on, and I was getting to the point of just finishing it! In saying all of this though, the main story line of the book was exceptional. It was different from most things I've read, and (only the first part of the book) really grabbed my attention."
5,Neil Denham,227,226,"Well, that was interesting! Read this for a book group, can't say I enjoyed it, but can see why it has become a classic. Reminded me a bit of Fear and Loathing in it's style.May take me a few weeks to formulate what I think of the book, and will be interesting to discuss with other about it. "
5,D. A.,229,228,"I discussed this book over a great french dinner. Although the subject matter was hard to read, Nabakov did an excellent job with the characterization of Humbert. As awkward as it felt, I knew this man. At times he made me laugh and at others he made me wince. So much so, that I was unable to finish it. It's not a favorite, but I can understand why it is a classic."
5,Amani,234,233,"Nabokov is a master prose stylist, and this book is worth reading for that alone. But I find the relationship between the two main characters disturbing. Dolores Haze is going to have to spend a fortune in therapy to get over what Humbert did to her."
5,Aleshka,236,235,It is a very graphic book but a bad story. 
5,Brian Levinson,237,236,"Man, Alfred Appel is a douche. He adds nothing. I sometimes wonder whether ""Alfred Appel"" is a pseudonym for Charles Kinbote (after all, Kinbote once said that all Zemblans are ""apple-cheeked"""" -- a hidden clue?). Anyway, just read the damn regular version of ""Lolita."" Even if you don't speak French, you can pick up what Nabokov means through context.I will give Appel credit for one thing: thoroughly explaining the names in the ""paper chase"" hotel-register sequence at the end of the novel. I have to admit, I didn't understand the significance of ""Dr. Kitzler, Eryx, Miss."" until Appel explained it to me. Now I know it's something to do with clitorises (clitori?). Awesome."
5,Jenna Garrett,238,237,"I know its a classic, but this book just creeped me out."
5,Cristi,243,242,i guess i didn't like the plot/story enough to truly see the good writing or finish the last 50 pages
5,Chelsea Heath,246,245,"The subject matter of this book was highly disturbing and it was pretty difficult to follow most of the time. Some interesting writing methods, but mostly a bit confusing."
5,Mackenzie,248,247,"Pop culture has completely distorted the plot of this book, so I picked it up with the wrong idea. I wish I had known. Anyway, as much as I trudged through almost all of it, the ending was somewhat redeeming, not just because he gets caught but also because of his murderous pursuit. That scene is probably one of the most vivid and is rather comical. I'm still not sure how I want to rate this as I really struggled getting through it, and I did not particularly like the characters or narrative, but the first several and last few pages of the book are good, Humbert's meditations very human, though definitely disturbing. He may not be a sympathetic character, but his thoughts often ring too familiar.Humbert says of his love for Lolita, ""It was love at first, at last sight, at ever and ever sight"" (270). Then he later admits, ""I simply did not know a thing about my darling's mind"" (284). Love then becomes defined by pure physical attraction and reaction, which is pretty shallow to me. He says he wants to preserve her innocence, yet Lolita accuses him, ""You merely broke my life"" (279) and rightfully so. Whatever feelings he has for her are selfish, and he does nothing to even try to behave appropriately for her sake. I can see how he might think he loves her, but as the jury whom he addresses, it's hard to give him that credit.One might praise Nabokov's use of words, and he does show excellent control over how he uses language. However, he definitely beats the reader over the head with his puns and play on names like Dolores and ""dollhouse"", Humbert and ""humble"", examples that do not even scratch the surface of the theme. It started to feel like the reader couldn't be trusted to catch onto the puns, so they had to be viciously exploited. I won't blame Nabokov for that, as it works with Humbert's own voice, but it was definitely annoying. Only by the end did he seem to trust his jury enough to pick up on his wordplay, or maybe he was just as ready to finish his tale and not spend extra time on his puns as I was.A part of me wants to give this 3 stars for the sake of its weight in society, but I truly did not like it enough to justify giving it so many. Maybe I missed something, but I don't really understand all the hype around this book. Unless it's just the shock factor of Humbert's degeneration."
5,Yaroslavna,249,248,"If there is a lesson to take away from this book it is that trying to justify one's actions, by showing everything from one's own perspective, only serves to make the crime committed appear much worse and the offender more despicable. At least Hannibal Lecter did not shamelessly pretend not to know that his actions were wrong and did not place the blame with his victims. Not admitting mistakes is a very unattractive quality which is why, despite the beautiful writing, I simply found Humbert's constant lies extremely unpleasant to read. In the end I have no sympathy for Humbert, no matter how hard he tried to evoke it.“Every man calleth that which pleaseth and is delightful to him, good; and that evil which displeaseth him: insomuch that while every man differeth from other in constitution, they differ also one from another concerning the common distinction of good and evil. Nor is there such thing as agathon haplos, that is to say, simply good...” Thomas Hobbes"
5,Dugan Maynard,253,252,"The deranged memoir of a psychotic pedophile-- just a bit of light reading I guess. Overall the writing was fairly good, but I found the number of typos and the quick switches between french and english fairly distracting. I thought the story could be improved if it was ambiguous as to whether or not the narrator assaulted the girl for the majority of the book as I think this would increase the dramatic tension-- as it currently stands it comes off as creepily oppressive.The ending is also quite odd, from the point following Humbert's mental breakdown after Lolita leaves the story takes an oblique turn and we are introduced to secondary characters who are quickly discarded, plots that go no where and a fairly gruesome murder with little build up or explanation.Overall an interesting yet highly flawed read."
5,Iñigo,254,253,"Un libro muy extraño, pero con unas descripciones realmente impresionantes. La trama es bastante aburrida, pero el vocabulario que usa Nabokov hace que te olvides que la muchacha que describe con tanto detalle y morbosidad tiene solamente doce años."
5,Debbie,256,255,"I largely found this book very boring. Yes, the subject matter was a little racy but that didn't bother me. I listened to this on audio and 11 minutes were spent describing Lolita's tennis game and how she looks when she serves. Some parts were very lovely and poetic, but I was so bored and looked forward to the audio coming to an end."
5,Sydney,257,256,"Difficult to read, but everyone should read Nabakov"
5,Eva Leger,259,258,"I finished this book. And I only skipped maybe 5-7 paragraphs.I'll say this - if you're like me and you get annoyed by too many details gear up if you plan on reading this. I'll admit though, this book IS the details. Without the over-abundance of details this wouldn't be where it is today.Overall, I'm glad I finally made it through but I can't see myself recommending it and I definitely won't be reading it again."

Depende"
5,Liam Bluer,265,264,"Couldn't get through it due to its wanky, navel-gazing prose."
5,Charlene Lewis- Estornell,267,266,"At times, the writing was spectacularly good. It was certainly shocking enough and broke all the taboos; and yet it, was terribly contrived and boring at times. Certainly being able to access and depict the darkest places in one's mind is a rare talent. Nabokov nails that aspect of the depraved human mind. Maybe all the hype set my expectations too high. I am not sure if that is the case of not. I only wish I could get back the hours I spent on this book. "
5,Thea Landen,268,267,"I feel the need to point out that my low rating is not due to the subject material, but rather the style of the book. Objectively, I can definitely see why ""Lolita"" is considered a classic, and there are some beautiful, brilliant lines, but there were points where the book seemed to needlessly drag and I struggled with the decision to keep going or not. It was interesting, I'm glad I read it, but I didn't really find it an enjoyable experience."
5,Shania Tasker,269,268,A book about a man with an obsession for girls - or as be calls them Nymphets - between the ages of 9 and 14? Not particularly my favourite story. I personally couldn't (and had no motivation to) finish the book.
5,Luke Holden,270,269,"Took me a while to get through this one. Not exactly a bad book as such, but not my thing at all. Writing style was difficult to absorb and I found myself glazing over and zoning out throughout the book. The most interesting part is Humbert's obsession with Dolores and the manipulation and abuse she suffers (although H.H. tries to convince you otherwise) as a result of his infatuation. Overall, pleased I made my way through it, but it left me feeling cold and I'm doubtful the prose will stick with me for any length of time."
5,Sifra,278,277,"Yes, I knew what she looked like after the 50th time to explained in length, dear author. I didn't need this other 200 times to fill those pages. The whole story need nothing more than 50 pages in total, and it lasted for 271 pages... UGH"

I can't get past the pedophilia, sorry. But reading it over again, I am noticing a lot more of the puns and allusions that people get excited about; I would say that if you like ""Literature,"" it's worth checking out."

5,Gretchen Buechler,286,285,"The part I found most interesting or one might say ""readable"" is the span when the narrator is going crazy. Otherwise, I think young Dolores puts it best when she says, ""But do you mind very much cutting out the French? It annoys everybody.""UPDATE: My boss recommended I try a different translation. Back on the ""to-read"" shelf it goes."
5,Sana Sheikh,288,287,a bore
5,Sarah Syahirah ,289,288,"Finally, managed to finish it!"
5,Justin Mitchell,293,292,"Yes, Nabokov is a master wordsmith. His writing style is detailed, complex, and vivid. But after reading this book I honestly can't get behind it. Is it possible for a book to be too well-written? I think yes, when the prose itself impedes the reader's understanding of the story, the characters, and the plot, which in the case of this book is exactly how I feel. What are words supposed to do? They are supposed to increase people's understanding of each other and the world they live in. When prose becomes so dense as to prevent understanding as opposed to increasing it, as a form of avoiding communication as opposed to undertaking it, then I feel a writer has failed to do his or her job, and in this case Nabokov gets so wrapped up in linguistic curlicues that he forgets to use his words not for their own sake but as tools of communication. Increasingly, I am moving towards a rejection of writers that write for the sake of writing. Usually, I find they are hiding either a) that they have nothing to say, or b) that what they have to say has very little or no redeeming value. And I just don't feel like Nabokov has much to say in this book; his two main characters are shallow, uninteresting and unsympathetic people drifting through a moral vacuum. And I refuse to allow use of the postmodern trapdoor, i.e. ""but that's just it, the world...has no meaning..."" because I think it is a passive cop-out. Humbert Humbert is a deranged sociopath and Lolita is a self-involved twit, and they live their lives in a decadent, disconnected haze (which is I suppose why Lolita's surname is ""Haze,"" but Nabokov doesn't even manage to make that point clearly). And I'm even open to a serious examination of the psychology of pedophilia or modern alienation and disconnection, or perhaps a questioning of society's sexual mores, but Lolita is none of those things. I'm not going to say it was bad, it wasn't, but it wasn't all that good, either."

5,Kamilah,297,296,Don't think I will finish this book. I felt dirty half of the time and other half wondering why the protagonist had such long winded thoughts. Maybe I'm not that deep but I really don't understand how or why this is a classic.
5,Bella123,300,299,"I had long been meaning to read this classic and was sorry I did. For me, it was overhyped and way too sickening and disturbing a storyline (have two teenagers myself). I had to force myself to finish this book. Vladimir's writing was very good however. Possibly too much vodka was consumed when writing this!!"

5,Brandi Piepgras,302,301,"I've read this book twice now, once with a friend and recently for an English class. Both times I've been left with a sick feeling in my gut, knowing that this is not a book that I will or ever could enjoy. The writing and wording is beautiful, as are the puzzles and culture references weaved into the novel. I can and will accept that those are the reasons that this novel belongs on the list of greats. However, coming from a woman who suffered sexual abuse as a child, this novel is nothing but a nightmare that makes me suffer all over again. The beautiful writing does not take away from the fact that this is a story about a man who prays on a young girl for his own pleasure."

Well, the first time I read it was more than ten years ago, so I guess I've changed a bit during that time..."
5,Taryn,314,313,"I was able to finish ""Lolita"" due solely to Nabokov's superb and clever style...the storyline was revolting, but the narrative was infuriatingly engaging and convincing. Things ended tragically for all of the mostly unlikable main characters and when I read that vanity fair called it ""the only convincing love story of our century,"" I threw up a little in my mouth. I found the writers notes at the end of the novel essential to my being able to concede a two star rating. I do not regret reading it, but I did not enjoy reading this book. "
5,V.,316,315,"I didn’t enjoy this book very much. The sexual/moral side of things didn’t really bother me. I think it was quite tastefully handled (considering) and since the story is being told by the perpetrator himself, you don’t expect it to be an even-handed telling.My main issue was with the narrator. I just found him very longwinded and tedious to listen to. I should say, I’m not a very big fan of poetry or language for its own sake. Not that I mind if a writer takes ten pages to tell me something, but I object to having to read ten pages to be told the same one thing ten times. I have the same reaction to people in real life who love the sound of their own voice too much. I realise that Humbert is very much an intentional creation and is meant to be a pretentious snob and a rather pompous narcissist and what-have-you , but to find that amusing you would have to think there was a legitimate, non-pompous version of that sort of character. And I don’t think there is. The guy who insists on telling you a wonderful story in the original Greek can’t be anything else.The story itself was surprisingly mundane. Much travelling around middle America and fretting, lots of fretting. Very repetitive. Would have probably made a great novella. "
5,James,317,316,"Although this book is infamous the author, for one reason or another, pulled the punch by making Dolores being already sexually active and even proactive in the case of Humbert. Maybe this was required for the time when this story was written but I find Dolores' proactive participation in her and Humbert's relationship more offensive than the actual relationship itself. That doesn't make the relationship right but it does lessen our revulsion.The story itself seems to me to be of two parts. The first part is pretty good and kept me involved. The second part I found boring and the last section which deals with descent into madness is confusing at best, and possibly allows the reader to experience in a small manner what madness feels like."

5,Keiley,319,318,"As I'm sure many of you are aware, Lolita is quite a famous novel. In fact it is a very, very famous novel. And when the entire world insists to me that a book is good, I generally take the time to read it. Particularly when the world insisted that this novel was a moral-breaker. The kind of book that left you standing in that moral grey area of your thoughts in which wrong and right were completely lost. So I was rather excited for this book. Alas, despite starting it in December I have only finished it today. Why, you may be asking, and that is because frankly, I did not enjoy this book. For the most part, reading it was a special sort of suffering, the likes of which I have never before endured.The novel follows the life of a Mister Humbert Humbert, who has a fetis--I mean love for young girls, whom he calls nymphets. He blames this 'love' due to the fact that when he himself was young, his great love, Annabel died. After beginning to live with a widow, Charlotte and her young daughter, Dolores, Humbert finds himself utterly enthralled with Dolores, who he privately nicknames 'Lolita'. Eventually he marries Charlotte in order to stay close to Lolita, but when his wife discovers his love for the child, she threatens to leave him and expose him to the police. So naturally, the woman gets hit by a car and Humbert collects Lolita from school and they travel the country, eventually embarking on a sexual relationship that turns into rape and prostitution fairly quickly.People often tell me that Lolita is a love story. No, it is not. At no point do I believe that anyone in this book loved anyone else in this book, least of all Humbert and his dear sweet Lolita. He was infatuated with her, and she loathed the man. He kidnaps and rapes her, even when she is gravely ill, and blackmails her into remaining silent about their affair. There was none of the moral hardships that I was informed I would endure, apparently I was supposed to be rooting for them, but really, I found Humbert despicable and Lolita to be a whiny brat, a thought that he shares. He detests her entire personality, the only reason he's so 'in love' with her, is because she looks like his long lost Annabel.At least three quarters of the book is spent describing nothing at all. Literally. And about half of that is describing Lolita herself. A quarter describing Humberts woe over the fact that he cannot have her, and even when he does have her, that she is actually a whiny little brat. It's all flowery prose about nothing. Well nothing and the fact that everything Lolita does is so perfect and tempting. At least in the eyes of Humbert.Alas, I could not appreciate whatever value the world seems to think this novel has simply because I found that there was no real plot, the characters were all detestable and if I have to read one more flowery description of Lolita/her beauty/her actions/anything to do with her, I might blow my brains out with a handgun."
5,Kimberley,321,320,"I listened to more than half of this book on audio but didn't like it, so didn't finish it. I watched the 1997 version of the movie years ago when I was around Lolita's age and remember thinking it was good and quite a sweet love story. Now in my late 20's, I didn't feel the same way about the book. No matter how poetically written it is, there's no getting away from the fact that Humbert is just a pedophile that lusts after young girls, or ""nymphets"" as he calls them. Although he never took advantage of Lolita against her will, there was something that just didn't sit right with me and made me uneasy.Moral issues aside, I found the book too long winded and a bit boring. I might watch the movie again and see how I still feel about that."
5,Hollie,322,321,I got the creeps from it...
5,Willona,329,328,"I hate this book. It's extremely well written--a true work of art, however, the subject matter is too much for me. It's not a love story. Lolita is 12. And Humbert attempts to slip her a roofie on several occasions... there are so many elements of this story that are not actually related to love that I don't understand how this myth about it being a ""love story"" or a tale of female seduction even got propagated. It's just bizarre to me. But, Nabokov was a skilled and gifted writer and he could tell a story. I find the story itself tragic and disturbing."
5,Charles Rouse,331,330,"Read it if you must. Why not. If Nabokov's reputation rests on this, I have some questions for the reputation makers. If there was any other story, in any other context, that involved a twelve year old girl being seduced by a forty two year old man, we wouldn't review the story, we would call the police. Why does Nabokov get a pass on fiction because it is fiction? That's the question. "
5,Gavin,332,331,"Paedophile is a bad man and an unreliable narrator. News at ten.No seriously though, the use of language and word games raise the odd smile throughout and yes Nabokov gets bonus points because English isn't his first -or even second- language but again: Praising good prose is like applauding because someone played a lot of notes.The characters are uniformly flat and unlikeable, the plot is repetitive, circular and dull and even with Jeremy Irons reading this thing to me it was an absolute slog that left me feeling 80% bored to 20% uncomfortable."
5,Mallary,333,332,i found it very hard to get through.. iwas getting a bit bored.
5,Florian Blümm,334,333,"The beginning of the story is very captivating. Humbert's honest approach to his most taboo desires. His pathetic plans and even more pathetic attempts of getting closer to lolita, any lolita.But her mother's death is very disappointing. This turning point in the story seems almost like an afterthought. Of course any active murder on Humbert's part would have been out of character. But couldn't Nabokov have thought up any other passive way of getting rid of her? A fatal accident, just in the nick of time? Come on!The 1st road trip is still interesting to follow, with all the psychology and guilt. but you could as well stop reading after they settle down..."

5,Owen Spencer,339,338,"Lolita chronicles the exploits and mental fantasies of an aspiring, 40-something-year-old pedophiliac who develops a morbid infatuation with a 12-year-old ""nymphet"". Although it is extremely well-written, the subject matter of this novel is far too disturbing and disgusting to be enjoyed. Here's an analogy: This book (Nabokov's critically-acclaimed exposition of sexual taboo) is like an aesthetic statue sculpted from fecal matter. It's like a beautifully polished turd with a repugnant stench. You can only admire it for so long before the smell overwhelms your senses and you turn away. I read only the first fifty pages."
5,Anais,340,339,"It is well written, no doubt, but this is not a love story. It is a story about a pedophile. If you get the book right, you're fine. Unfortunately most people don't get the book at all. Lolita is not a seducer, she is a victim. 12-year-olds don't want old men to lust over them. This books was written by a man after all..."

5,Roberta,347,346,Nabokov treats a lewd subject delicately.
5,Nenad Nesic,350,349,"Previse prepricavanja, premalo ""show, don't tell""-a. Kada zapravo prica direktno sta se desava, dosta je kul i zanimljivo (razgovor sa Lolitom u kolima, muljanje na kaucu, susret sa Monik...), al' izgleda da je opisavnje americkih vukojebina bitnije od razradjivanja nikad vidjenog odnosa u knjizevnosti.Sta ocekivati od coveka koji u pogovoru kaze da je jedino estetsko uzivanje bitno (sto nisi postao onda slikar? Nazad u deveti krug pakla zajedno sa Mervinom Pikom) i zelja da izbaci knjigu iz sebe. Ok, ok, to be perfectly fair, nije kao da ja ne uzivam u estetskom dozivljaju, al' nemam utisak da Nabokov ima nesto posebne opise. ""Bili smo tamo, videli to i to"", boooring.On pomiminje i ""Za mene prozno umetnicko delo postoji samo utoliko mi pribavlja ono sto cu odsecno nazvati estetskim blazenstvom, to jest, osecanje da sam nekako, negde, povezan s drugim stanjima postojanja gde je umetnost (radoznalost, neznost, dobrota, zanos) pravilo"". Ja jesam osetio neku bittersweet neznost u delu sa Monik jer nekako ima motiv i razlog iza toga (on u nju vidi svoju staru ljubav), dok prazni opisi svake stvari koju vidi usput mi nista ne znace.To be even fairer, citao sam na srpkom, sto sam tek u pogovoru prevodioca shvatio da je kobna greska, posto ima mnogo vise word-play-a u engleskom izdanju, koja nisu mogla da budu prevedena. K'o sto sam Nabokov kaze, ""jedan americki kriticar je nagovestio da je Lolita hronika moje ljubavi s romanticnim romanom. Stavljanje reci 'engleski jezik' na mesto 'romanticnog romana' ucinilo bi ovu elegantnu formulu tacnijom""."

5,Maher,352,351,"While the subtleties of narration and the sheer decadence of his prose are worthy of praise, I feel there was an over-verbosity to this work. Did I really need 3 pages listing every single hotel they stayed at? I think not."
5,Jamee,354,353,"It wasn't the controversial topic -- although it was disturbing several times to read his fantasies about a child. There's a controversay about did H.H. really love Lolita or was he just a pedophile? I do believe that he really did love her because when she ceased being a ""nymphet"" in age his love was still there. What I had a hard time with was the overly-flowery, hard to understand writing style. So descriptive in such poetic ways which I guess to some might be beautiful but to me was just annoying. I had a hard time following the storyline. Add in the French passages (with no translation) and I really got left out. I don't like feeling left out of a book."
5,Cryolath,362,361," I think the pictur on the cover for this website is really creep. But, as for the story, you find yourself caught up in the main characters lies and half truths, and sometimes It's hard to find out what actually happened. I'm sure I misinterpreted several parts, it's a very depressing sort of read, but the end begins to make up for it."
5,Raquel,364,363,"I was freaked out with every sensual expression and lascivious description the narrator had about this weird-ass flirty little girl(who needed a spank in my opinion). It was beautifully written---no doubt about that. But...it had me cringing. Maybe it's the pedo-theme, but I couldn't help to feel weird about the whole situation, which is splendid by the fact that I, as a reader, was able to travel through the mind of a ill-minded person. A pedophile. "
5,Frank Roberts,366,365,"First off, the crucifix wearing cashier at Waldenbook's tried refusing my purchase* of the book until I pushed back, pointing out that a bookstore ain't a porn drive-in and it wasn't 1956. After that kind of resistance I just had to dive right in.Kinda dull it was. Didn't take Humbert too long to score with Lolita. And with his groveling neediness and her sniveling bitchiness it didn't take too long for me to wish they were actual people I could punch in the face. A lot.For better Nabokov reading look into his butterfly studies. *This is one of my ""incisive"" reviews based on having read the book more than 25 years ago while still a teen. Nabokov's most famous book did make enough of an impact on me to recall enough to belch out my thoughts...For better fun with sexual taboos try out Jackass On A Camel...

5,Ari,368,367,"2.5 Cuando lo empecé me estaba gustando mucho, pero a partir de la segunda parte empezó a hacerse pesado y monotono. El estilo de Nabokov me ha inspirado y exasperado a partes iguales, y le doy una puntuación de 2.5/5, 6/10 porque voy a intentar ser más crítica este 2016. PD: La primera página del libro sigo (y seguiré) opinando que es el mejor inicio de novela que se ha escrito del mundo (que yo haya tenido el placer de leer)."

Thanks to Liz I appreciate the writing a bit more, but felt very caught in the author's head the whole time and wanted to know more about Lolita -- though I must say, the book did do a good job of making me feel trapped by the nuerosis/paranoia/obsessions of the author. So maybe it did its part. I don't know. Not my favorite, but not the worst book ever."
5,Amro,375,374,"A well written book but why it's his most popular book, I fined a bit of a mystery. I am a big fan of Nabokov - he's one of my favourite writers - but this is nowhere near my favourite. I found the subject very difficult and the characters unlikeable - perhaps it was just my modern sensibilities. Read Nabokov - but don't start with this one. "

5,Bradley,380,379,"That was a tough one, I can't say that the story was difficult to read as far as subject matter is concerned but the writing is difficult to read and keep up with. I understand it is supposed to be a memoir of sorts but the constant ramblings and shifting lack structure making the book that much harder to read. I have a hard time recommending this one to anyone I am not sure why I finished reading it. "

5,Ileana,389,388,"This book in my opinion was overrated and disappointing. The book itself is amazingly written, very great language and wit, but I can't bring myself to get over how disgusting Humbert is, with his delusions and justifications of his behaviour and blaming poor Lolita for his actions. Also I find some reviews of this book very concerning. How can people feel sorry for him or justify anything he does is beyond me, he is a monster and there is nothing good about him, only the way he speaks. "

He is not a lovable character at all. Even though Lolita was quite a brat, I feel terribly bad for her. If you read this book prepare to be disturbed and have a sleepless night."
5,Melissa Mahle,397,396,"This book was on my 100-classics-to-read. This book was hard to read and hard to rate. It is beautifully written. The narrative voice is so powerful and the storytelling, with the flash backs woven throughout, effective. I couldn't put it down. But the plot, oh my...as a mother with a daughter of the same tender age. I can understand the outrage at this book when it was published and still today, as it glories a sexual predator. It reminds me of the controversy over the Hunger Games. Can you like the book and hate the concept (kids killing kids)? Apparently, given the popularity of the book and movie. With Lolita, I just could not get past the premise. "
5,The Book Slayer,398,397,"I don't think it's a mystery why some adults abuse children. If it's violently or verbally (such as when I was a child tolerating my parents' juvenile name-calling), it's usually due to jealousy. Those kinds of adults had miserable childhoods, and they see you happy and smug, and they decide, fuck it, I'm going to break that little shit's mind. They don't want you to enjoy yourself, they don't want you to succeed and have a happy childhood, a better childhood than what they experienced. But here, in this book, we have an adult abusing a child sexually, and I can only imagine why. There are hints, and I did perceive what the problem was with Humbert Humbert, the remorseful narrator. You could sympathise with him to some degree - he grew up disturbed, losing the love of his life, even if it was just a childhood crush, and now as an adult, he wants to relive that bittersweet youth romance. At least that's what I think this book is about. It's not until about page 150 that Humbert actually has sex with the 12-year-old girl, and even then, it's not really described in any detail and that may or may not aggravate you. It would've been interesting to see how Lolita aka Dolores Haze reacted to these sex sessions, whether she was laughing happily or serious or depressed and hesitant. All we get is Humbert's narration, and as everyone knows, he's so unreliable, how he perceived this little girl can't be accurate. How do we know what she's feeling based on his perception? Many times throughout the book, I got the impression Lolita was actually much younger: nine years old maybe, or even seven years old, based on her playful immaturity, her ignorance towards what was going on and all that. However, that's the nature of the book - you get this record of events from a 1st-person POV, from a man in prison or something, after the crime went down. It's like a diary, although massively lyrical and descriptive in some sense. The story is made sweet and glossy by a madman!It's obvious the author has great command of words, but I was only rarely enthralled by them. I was kinda skimming or fast-reading, going quickly because they're just words without much concrete attachment to the narrative. Not overindulgence, just articulate and wordy for the purpose of painting a picture of a disturbed man. Though it's unlikely you will be repulsed by him or cover your mouth in shock (it's only fiction; no kids were harmed here; it's not real), I imagine most people could identify the lack of depth in the Humbert character, how he's quick to condemn himself but not really get down to the nitty-gritty psychology of child abuse. Its motivations, its repercussions. Again, the sex is all but avoided over the course of the entire novel. I've only ever seen the 1997 movie which also only alluded to the intimate relations between Humbert and Lolita. In the end, I liked some of the language throughout the book, the words, phrase and ideas, but this book is OLD and it's not cutting-edge. I can't imagine the author knows how perverted criminals think - it just seems unlikely. What, he researched child abuse at his library, or visited prisons and talked to sexual deviants? I highly doubt it. All I really learnt from the book was a simple psychology, a clichéd psychology, which anyone could think up if they really tried. The only really provocative idea within the novel that I could see (and something that would never enter the world of Hollywood in a movie adaptation) is when Humbert threatens the kid, saying, ""If you tell the police I'm molesting you, I will end up in prison, but you ... oh boy, you're headed for rehabilitation in a boarding school! The boredom will kill you, Lolita. No more toys and ice creams! But if we continue with our forbidden relationship, I'll buy you nice things, everything a young girl could dream of."" Yeah, that's something totally nasty about this book.Enjoyment Factor: 2 starsMovie Potential: 2 stars"
5,Anna  (Bananas!),399,398,"The subject matter isn't what bothered me. Overall I was just underwhelmed, especially since the book is both lauded and notorious. I expected more shock and awe, I guess. Expectations ruining another book for me? I'm sure that's part of it but certainly not everything. It was funny occasionally so I give it points for that. Neither Humbert Humbert nor Lolita were engaging for me though. "
5,Jaymie,401,400,"I don't get it. I don't know what I was expecting when I began to read this book, and I know people are divided on this story. I am one who doesn't get it.Firstly, I didn't like the characters. The only one I liked was Lolita's mother because she was mildly entertaining. I can't get over that the main character, our narrator, is named Humbert Humbert? Really? Was that necessary? And even if it's a double name thing, why on earth Humbert? Anyways, I know his feelings for Lolita stem from a childhood love, but it's just so stupid. Lolita doesn't seem very believable to me. She's really forward and crass for a twelve-year-old, especially towards a middle-aged (or close to middle-aged) man that she barely knows. I can't imagine anyone real her age doing that. Also, she kept striking me as being dirty, not in a sexual way but a cleanliness way. Hey, maybe that's a metaphor for her personality. After a while, Humbert doesn't even seem that attracted to her anymore, and their many escapades and adventures don't seem plausible.I could go on. What I liked about the book is that it's easy to read, and the writing is sometimes poetic (not including the actual included poems, which are also rather nice). "
5,♡Ann  Matalines♡,402,401,I give up. DNF ON CHAPTER 24. I tried so hard to really finish the book. I'm not going to be fickle-minded and judge the remaining of the book.

5,Laura Jean,403,402,"This is an excellently written work of literature. For that, would that I could give it a higher rating. I cannot.No matter how well written, I find pedophilia from the viewpoint of the pedophile a disturbing, vile and loathsome topic, particularly when the child/""nymphette"" is allocated the blame.I read this as a precursor to ""Reading Lolita in Tehran,"" to which I shall now move on."
5,Isabell,404,403,"I had quite high expectations for this book because it is listed both on the 1001 books you need to read before you die list and on Bloom's Western Canon. Both usually include high-quality literature and so far I've at least liked or seen something good about every book I've read from the lists. Not so this time.This was one of the few books I read in the last year (I actually read it this year, but the new year is still fresh enough that this statement has more meaning when I take my reading experiences of last year into account as well) where I struggled with finishing it. It started very slow, didn't manage to capture me and even repulsed me. I didn't really feel the need to go on or even to finish this book. I eventually did finish it, because I'm bad at not-finishing books. Once I started a book I usually finish it. Otherwise I couldn't really give an educated opinion about it. But the fact that I finished this doesn't make it a good book.The main character Humbert Humbert is a pedophile who ""falls in love"" with his landlady's minor daughter. He knows that he is sick and that what he is doing is wrong but he does it nonetheless. Reading about him (the book is actually written from his point-of-view) made me feel sick.I have to give Nabokov his due in saying that I really liked the writing style and his way of expressing things. I could even have gotten around to seeing some merit in it should it have supposed to be a cautioning example. However, Nabokov said in the afterword explicitly that the book was not thought to have a ""meaning"" in the sense how it is taught in literature classes. If I accept his statement for truth I have to wonder why he wrote this book.This is one of the few pieces of ""literature"" that I can't recommend to anybody else for reading and I'll things twice before I read another work by Nabokov."
5,Zaki,405,404,"There is an old french proverb that sais ""don't fart above your arsehole"" and I think I was doing that by trying to tackle highbrow literature like Nabokov's Lolita. Why this book is held in such high regard went right over my head."
5,Tayla,409,408,"Lolita reviewThis book took me so long to read due to uni deadlines and also the fact that the language is hard and being potentially dyslexic I found it hard to understand what was going on. By hard language, I mean it is a more traditional piece of literature like something you would be made to read in school for GCSE's with higher vocabularly. However, although the story has a interesting ""judged"" background, from what I understood the story was good but confusing. I'm glad I read it and challenged myself not to give it up. I now want to read Ben brooks version Lolito! Last 3/4 chapters I skim read as I became bored and pretty much knew what was going to happen due to the rest of the book. I won't read it again, but I am glad I can say I stuck through it and finally read it."

His descriptions of the physical attributes of 'tween' girls and his justifications for his actions actually made me grimace. I think this book is a classic simply because it's so shocking. It's a gleaming example of free speech; perverted, predatory, disgusting, free speech. Well written in the voice of the character but I hated it."
5,Thespian999,424,423,Do not read this book if you cannot keep in mind that the main character is mentally ill. It's very disturbing and it contains very adult content. I wouldn't reccomend this for anyone under a very mature 16. It's not an easy book to read. 
5,Marianna,426,425,My daughter was assigned this book in high school so I read it after she did. As a parent I found this a very difficult book to read. Humbert Humbert is evil for being so ordinary and I think this book makes a paedophile's point of view appear benign which it clearly is not. He ruins Lolita's life which ends tragically as a result of ever meeting him. Awful. I can't believe that it is considered a 'must read' or literature. I think if female professors ruled this book would be dropped from the syllabus. 
5,Julie Aquilina,430,429,"Unsettling. Beautifully written, yet riddled with small errors. That's all I can say about it right now."
5,Abigail,434,433,Well written. Disturbing.
5,Kristyn Shaw,442,441,The writing style is great but the story is horrifying.
5,Missy J,443,442,"The first time I read this book, I couldn't finish it. It was too disturbing. This summer I decided to finally read this book again and finish it this time. Many people praise this book. However, I still find this book disturbing and the writing not excellent. Wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
5,Jerry Auld,446,445,"Two years to finish this book and only by dedicating some days on vacation and counting the pages. With a great and powerful start, it devolves into a poor travelogue and repetitive description (both narrative and expository) that started to sound like a listing out of Vlad's notebook from sitting in diners and trying to capture 1950s America with a listicle. Perhaps it was the age that this came out - the forbidden talk of pedophilia. Now it sounds too much like buzzfeed click bait - just trying to get attention. Although at times the writing is simply beautiful, the story is just not that strong once Humbert possesses Dolly. He should have ended it there. I do not get why this book had such a big impact."
5,Ida,451,450,"I really wanted to love this book. Content aside, I just can't make myself like Nabokov's prose. It's pompous and dull and I can't help but feel like I missed something crucial as this book was nothing noteworthy to me. "
5,Roxy,452,451,It took some time to get into the rhythm of the writing. Once i did I was enjoying it and how inticing the story became but about halfway through the story shifted and lost all of its heat. I became so bored that I could not finish it.
5,Darshana,453,452,got only half way through the book. it is amazing the level of english that this book is written in compared to the books these days. though i wasn't really interested being inside the head of a pedophile .. the author does a good job of making you feel humbert's obsession or sickness I'd call it. 
5,Aksana,454,453,"Have trouble getting into this book, don't know if it's due to the subject matter. Maybe, will pick up later again."
5,Jason Kosarek,461,460,Interesting style.. Personally couldnt get past it being about a pedophile. 
5,Leslye Macdonald-Tower,464,463,kind of creepy really.
5,Tiffiny,465,464,Kinda creepy
5,Ashley Binder,466,465,I found this difficult to get through and the story overall pretty uninteresting. I think that makes me some sort of literary hack.
5,Alana,471,470,very different
5,Teryll,473,472,"The cover of my book called it the ""most convincing love story of the 20th century"" but I beg to differ (along with most of the women in my book club). This book was a hard pill to swallow, in addition to the topic of the book, his writing style was hard to get into. Nabakov is successful at one thing in this book - getting into the psyche of his character. Humbert Humbert is a tragic man, can't even really call him a man in my book, and while Humbert wrestles with his inner demons, a child loses her sense of self and youth. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone really, it's disturbing on so many levels, but if you're into the twisted and dark, perhaps this one's for you."
5,Clare Wang,474,473,"Okay, let's be frank, I honestly wanted to read this book because of all the hype of how disturbing it was. (YES, DISTURBING THINGS CAN ROUSE CURIOSITY). The beginning- though it was creepy and sick- was interesting in a sense, actually throughout the whole novel, Nabokov tackles some very difficult and sensitive concepts as to how people view what we call a 'pedophile' today. I think Nabokov, in this novel, successfully demonstrates that there is more depth to be discovered to the term 'pedophile', that Humbert is not just some crazy man who fantasizes about girls all day. He has a depth to him. HOWEVER, what really wore me down was that Nabokov spent the WHOLE book writing about how crazy Humbert is about Lolita. With all that buildup in the beginning, one would expect something to happen in the end, but noooo, Humbert fails in a sense and continues to live a sad life. This perhaps, is Nabokov's method of conveyed the idea of the harshness of reality or some further deeper meaning which idk man. There is some great sections of detail and description in the novel as wellOverall, a strange but creepily memorable book. I only wish there was more of an development and for the book to be in ENGLISH ONLY. (I can't speak french) "

5,Gabssy,477,476,"Май не мога да се разбера с романите, обявени за шедьоври...книгата направо ме заливаше с всевъзможни метафори и епитети, от които единствения, който запомних е ""димни"". И целият водопад от думи и емоции не беше достатъчен, за да ме впечатли..."
5,Luciana Guerra,478,477,"Eu queria dar duas estrelinhas e meia, mas não tem essa opção... Sinceramente eu acho que minha leitura meticulosa estragou um pouco o livro, então acho que o livro ganharia muito em uma releitura, que eu pretendo fazer em algum fim de semana desses..."
5,Eleanor,479,478,"My brother gave me Lolita, his favorite book, for Christmas this year. Although I enjoyed it more than the Bolano tome my borther gave me two years ago, I didn't love it. It's certainly interestingly written, but it has the same sense of awaiting the inevitable downfall that I find difficult in Tom Wolfe's novels. In addition, I found the driving from hotel to hotel sections interminable and the pedophile stuff hard to take. (I don't love books from the perspective of murderers either.) "
5,Elaine,480,479,"Let me quote Ramona Quimby from her infamous book report: ""I can't believe I read the whole thing!"" This book was a trial for me. Abusive (in so many ways) pedophile as the hero of the story? And Nabokov's writing in no way convinced me that he should be pitied in any way. In fact, the long, descriptive, and arrogant soliloquies put me off so much that I just wanted to chuck the book across the room. Glad this one is done."
5,Reem Lambert,481,480,"Well i think i've decided to read lolita because of the same reason most people go ahead and read it, its infamous reputation. Putting that aside, the plot was okay, it didn't really appeal to me. I was sort of disappointed at the beginning and i kinda liked it towards the end ( i dont know if its because i was close to finishing it) which is why i added an extra star in my rating. I dont think reading any book, whether we liked it or not is a waste of time. So no regrets there but i still have mixed emotions towards the book. "
5,Nola Redd,483,482,"I don't remember being particularly impressed with this book. Of course, I read it over ten years ago."
5,Sasti,484,483,"Jujur, aku tuh bingung dengan jalan ceritanya .mungkin, kata-katanya yang terlalu canggih hingga aku tidak bisa mencerna kata-kata yang ada di novel ini .sumpah!! bingung aku .."
5,nunya,485,484,I gave up a little more than half way though because I saw the Kubrick movie and figured it wasn't worth it. 
5,Vyou,487,486,"La verdad es que no se que puntaje ponerle a este libro. Le puse dos estrellas porque goodreads me dice que significa que estuvo bien...y supongo que lo estuvo. No tengo mayor problema con la historia porque solo me pareció bleh. Se que es un tema controversial pero no fue por eso que no termino de convencerme. La verdad es que mi mayor problema es con los personajes, no fueron para nada de mi agrado, a tal punto que no podía ni siquiera sentir lastima por lolita. Pero sin duda la narrativa de Nabokov es espectacular, creo que de no ser por su pluma hubiera dejado este libro antes de las primeras 100 páginas."
5,06MirandaH,488,487," Don't judge me. I blame it on the Police. (the band, not the cops)I was listening to ""Don't stand so close to me"" and decided to look up Nabokov. I read (am reading) this book based on how highly reviewed it is. Lots of people hold the opinion that it is fantastically written. And I agree. Not with the subject neccessarily, but with the writting. Learning new words, going on a moral seeking quest, and feeling guilty reading this is only a few of the perks of this book. I took this to school today to try and finish it and get rid of it before a blemish would appear on my already tarnished social image. However, it is hard to read a book in very large print (the only copy I could find was in large print) and not be paranoid that someone is reading this potentially racy book over your shoulder. (UNRELATED VAGUELY RELATED RANT: As an underage juvenille who CLEARLY has no idea what I'm talking about, this book made me want to change a few laws. It demonstrated a (mostly) consentual relationship between a minor and an adult. I think that the whole ""have to be 18"" rule is total bull. I'm not sugguesting we all go find our own little 12 year old Lolita, but a resonable emotional and physical maturity. If you were just 15 and went out with an 18 year old, you would have gone to school together. You would have the same friends, the same connections,same social interactions, and same or similar life. Instead, the ""adult"" (brains aren't fully developed untill 25, so that should be adult. not the teenager who turned the magic number and still has the same mentality level for the next few years) gets charged with statutory rape and gets charged with a misdemeanor or up to 5 years in jail.END OF UNREALTED VAGUELY RELATED RANT!) Tying all this together again: Humbert, no matter how likeable he was at times, broke the law. BIG time. He extorted her,she extorted him. The little nymphette should go to jail to. Lolita's actions where completly out of control and highly manipulative. I have sympathy for him, but I havent reached the end yet and found out what happened. Lolita runs away with another adult, whom Humbert calls ""Trapp"" (I'm not sure if that actually is who he is because I'm tired and kind of skimmed. pinky promise I'm going to analyze it this weekend in depth and detail.) If I met this chick, I would slap her. She is a little slut! And, she basically set in motion the dominos to ruin Humbert's life, and then runs off and does this to some other poor bloke! (off to finish the rest)Update: I've been procrastinating reading it, because this book makes me wanna shower a bit more. This isn't a good thing to read, how many people do you know that read Lolita and thought,""Hey. I feel like a better person now."" I'll never be able to look at 12 year old girls the same way ever again. Not even sure I wanna finish it.Update of an update: I don't want people to see my profile and see that I am reading this *wonderful* and *wholesome* book, So I'm gonna just say I finished it. By the way, 12 year old girls are still terrifying. But this is a problem with modern society to. Just go to Classic Skating on a tursday, and the 12 year olds wear less than I do!"
5,Lword,489,488,"Wow, this was a very disturbing book. I guess its poetic language and daring subject make it the classic that it is, but it's not a nice story. I read it because it's one of the classics, but had I not, I don't think I would have missed much."
5,Katrina,490,489,I can see why this an important work but I did not enjoy it. 
5,Troy Lindeman-Wyner,494,493,I like this more after our book club discussion. 3 1/2 stars. 
5,Sander,496,495,"I was not as taken in, taken away, or caught as I wish I could have been. Nabokov is one of the great American writers of this century and Lolita's topic is fascinating; pedophilia, imprisoning a minor, love and lust, but the book left little impression on me. I am sorry for this."
5,Katrice,497,496,"Do not be deceived by my rating. It means absolutely nothing after being only a faint glimmer within a slight manifestation of my reading preferences. This is a beautiful work of art. Indeed Vadimir Nabokov's words remind me of flowers at the peak of bloom out of a dreamy photograph derived from an extremely analogous roll of expired Ferrania Solaris 35mm film. Naturally, his eloquence is admirable (especially considering that he tackles the idea of love. The term ""love"" itself is indefinable, he works his magic around the exact meaning of it- Bravo, Nabokov) but equally amazing is how he weaves extremely effective humor around a dark(?- H.H. was a man in love) subject matter. Artful and painfully clever.. a truly gifted writer. (of course i feel like a pompous fool writing that last line.. I am only me and Nabokov is Nabokov.)"
5,stephanie roberts,500,499,"Vladimir Nabokov is an amazing writer and i look forward to reading his other works. This was my fist foray into Nabokov, and I discovered why his prose is revered by other writers, but as strangely engaging as he makes our dark protagonist make no mistake this is a story of a murderous, brutally abusive, and manipulative pedophile. It is crystal clear this is Nabokov's meaning, as well as the protagonist's take on his own behaviour. There is something so vile about the coolheaded way that rape is discussed, that i couldn't help contrasting it to the violence of Saramago and Cormac McCarthy and finding this book more disturbing, because a strangely pretty face is put on the perversity. I think the one reason this book has not been relegated to the darkest corners of the library is that Lolita is an almost supernaturally resilient child that refuses to be overtly destroyed by her captor. But there is a second reason that haunts me. I can't help wondering if the enduring appeal of this book is evidence of a strain/stain through literary academia that wishes to romanticize the actions of a violent obsessive narcissist to legitimize or dignify the darkest desires of male control over vulnerable children. Better to laud a charming literary figure and the educational value of the text, created by the virtuosity of a highly esteemed novelist, than admit ones fiendish dark urges. I think that is why this villian has been enduringly recast as a romantic figure, against Nabokov's explicit condemnation (which even extended to Nabokov insisting that no representation of Lolita be used on the cover yet voila! observe the very cover of this edition).If I had to rate this book on the writing alone, and not the content I would give it five stars, and it's not that I wish I'd never read it the way Saramago and McCarthy have traumatized me in the past (ai yi yi). It's that I feel it is used to harmfully muddy the waters between child abuse and adult romance. "
5,Holden Alcazaren,501,500,This is just a confusing book. Bilingual dialogues just made it harder to sympathize with this pedo.

5,Aline,509,508,"It was quite a slow story, with huge descriptions about things that didn't interested me."
5,Timmy,511,510,"Another book I didn't quite make it through. There was a point at which I just started feeling icky. Viewing a story from the eyes of a pedophile, and starting to maybe actually side with the guy a bit... not so fun. Which makes me think the book was doing it's job. Yeesh. The two star rating reflects my emotional reaction to the book rather than any judgement on the writing. "
5,Sedy .,513,512,"Comencé pensando que la novela está sobrevalorada. Después de reflexionar, he llegado a la conclusión de que Lolita fue una obra quizá demasiado ""moderna para su época"". Una historia muy original y poco vista, que tuvo sus dificultades para ver la luz (si la pornografía se consideraba vulgar, imaginaos un libro sobre el incesto y la pederastia, en el que el narrador es un maníaco). Por eso, creo yo, es por lo que ahora recibe muchísimas críticas buenas. Y lo entiendo. Y si yo hubiera vivido en esa época estoy segura de que el libro me hubiera escandalizado. Y admiro mucho al autor por su osadía y el granito de arena que ha aportado a la libertad en la palabra escrita. Pero el tema es que soy una chica del siglo XXI. Es por eso que Lolita no me ha gustado.Cuando me comencé a interesar sobre el libro, pensaba que se trataría el tema en profundidad y podría meterme por completo en la mente de Humbert Humbert. Me equivoqué. Además, ese estilo tan sobrecargado y de ""persona culta"" me ha entorpecido mucho el libro (por no mencionar las páginas y páginas innecesarias que hablan sobre lugares, excursiones o de nada en general). Sobre la psicología de los personajes no os ilusionéis, porque sólo vais a conocer al protagonista. Todos los secundarios son meros figurantes que se pueden olvidar con facilidad y, cuando resurgen, es necesario volver atrás en la historia para ver ""quién diablos era ese"".En resumen, Lolita me ha parecido un libro poco estructurado, con un lenguaje muy artificioso (y muchas expresiones francesas intercaladas que no he entendido, puesto que no hablo el idioma) y una trama que va adelante y atrás, y ahora para aquí y para allá. Y es que yo hubiera preferido que fuera un relato. ¿Por qué digo esto? porque un capítulo de la segunda parte me ha parecido el único que merecía la pena de todos los leídos, con un montón de matices y sentimientos y sorpresas. Todos los demás, me han parecido pajilla (no encuentro otra palabra para expresarlo mejor)."
5,Missie,515,514,This book was written beautifully but the subject matter turned my stomach and probably gave me a few extra wrinkles!! I don't know why this book was listed as one of the 100 books people should read . . . I will try another novel by Vladimir Nabokov I just hope that the story line won't make me vomit! No word combination would make pedophilia worth reading about!
5,Emma,516,515,I wasn't able to focus while reading this one. Something about the writing style didn't draw me in.

5,Masked ,526,525,"i hated this book. it's tedious, whining and utterly devoid of interesting characters. ugliness can be done well, but not here. people like this because it's a taboo subject, no matter what crap they tell you about literary merit. boring, boring, boring. "

5,Lara Iodice,529,528,"Sarò impopolare, ma non sono riuscita ad apprezzarlo assolutamente: le prime pagine erano mediamente interessanti, ma arrivata a meno di metà libro ha iniziato ad annoiarmi. Ho pensato che era un peccato abbandonarlo e che magari andando avanti mi sarebbe piaciuto di più, ma nulla! Indubbiamente è ben scritto, ma per il resto non posso considerarlo questo grande capolavoro."

5,Tereza,536,535,"No book is a waste of time. But it doesn't mean all books are amazing. Lolita is one of those classics that are not amazing yet they are not a waste of time either. The truth is, it really does not give me anything except for maybe a different prospective. Which I always appreciate but sadly it is not enough."

5,Alberto,538,537,"Scrittura e stile mirabile senza alcun dubbio ma alla fine del primo tempo (pag. 200) non sono più riuscito ad entrare in campo. ""Argomento"" particolare che non mi appassiona per nulla. Nabokov non si dispiacerà."
5,Anaïs,539,538,"I read it because one of my friend recommanded it to me. I did not enjoy this book. I found the relationship between the two characters to be really weird and most parts of this book put me ill at ease.However if you're looking for something to put you out of your confort zone this might be for you.If you don't know what it's about, the only thing you need to know is that it deals with incest. I did not say rape. Incest. The 13 yrs old Lolita and her relationship with this older man that pretends to be her father in front of the world but really is her lover. Their disturbing, strange, awkward relationship. Kind of a love story in a way. Definitely not for me. Even know, a few years after reading it, when I think about it I don't feel comfortable. At the same time, maybe if I re-read it I would find things that I didn't see the first time."
5,Krista Skene,540,539,"I have read half of this already. I like his style of writing and would probably enjoy other books by him, but I really hated the subject matter. I wasn't able to disconnect and see it as fiction. I don't know if I will ever be able to read this book. "
5,Bea,547,546,"I think I don't reveal any spoilers that aren't already in the synopsis, but i'm tagging it with spoilers anyway.oh Lo, Lola, Lolita, you really aren't my cup of tea.in this book we see a guy, that goes by Humbert Humbert in the book, that is attracted to children, not any kind of children only nymphets. and he describes how painful his life was because of this attraction, and it becomes even worse when this nymphet, Lolita, comes into his life.now let me explain why i didn't like this book. the guy was a huge pervert, someone that denies it is lying, the book is written in his POV and it really bothered me most of the things he said, the way he described Lolita, a 12 year old girl, and the way that he treated her later in the book was just too much for me and i felt uncomfortable reading it. I know that most people had the same problem, but they got over it after the first part, but i couldn't, it still was really uncomfortable reading it. and it really confuses me when people say that Humbert is the victim here.I didn't like the book, maybe I'm too young to get over Humbert, or maybe it just isn't my cup of tea, all I know is that i'm not revisiting Lolita any time soon."

5,Jimmy,550,549,"I have never failed to finish a book that I set out to read. Lolita almost made me question that stance. I felt as though I finished the book more out of spite than enjoyment.I finished readin Lolita for one reason only- because I can. Lolita is a book that made me uncomfortable but I refused to let that stop me. I feel that since there are so many people in the world who would not want me to read this, that I had no choice but to finish it. Lolita is incredibly sexual and when reading from the viewpoint of HH, it can be difficult to remember that the object of his desire is a tween.The prose is beautiful in this novel. It flows and dances but never really leads anywhere. Since Lolita is written from the 1st person perspective of an unreliable narrator, it was perfect but did make for an easy read.I am more happy to have completed this novel than any in recent history.I would recommend that anyone who appreciates good literature, who is also willing to push the limits of his/her own comfort, read this book."
5,Dave Brown,553,552,"A difficult book to read. The beauty of Nabokov's mastery of language is a distinct counterpoint to the dark subject matter. One finds oneself caught between disgust at the pedophiliac protagonist, and sorrow for him as he is unwilling to seek change for the condition he attributes to a childhood event. He alternates between an acceptance of damnation for himself, to shamelessly indulging his fantasies, to lamenting and recognizing the shame in his actions in the end. The descriptions can leave one nauseated at times, and I won't even discuss the obvious imagery of the the weapon that isn't used until the end, and then not effectively. The articulate European encounter with post-war America is poignant, but an undercurrent to the primary plot. If you are looking for an example of the writer's craft, I would advise you to consider this book. Otherwise, it would be difficult to recommend. "

5,Elizabeth Escobar,559,558,"Wow was this a tough book!Yes, it's a classic just because Nabokov wrote it very, very well: very dark humor --- otherwise, how can you read a book, feeling a little sorry for a pedophile. The plot finally moved the last 1/3 of the book, but the build up-- surprisingly for the times, lots of sex (I guess that's why this book is so famous) -- is interesting. Read this only if you are up to the challenge. Skim, skim, skim through the tough, annoying details. Which are classic for this older writing. Then watch the movie... I was surprised how much they talked about the sex. But of course it doesn't do the book justice... which is why I have a strict law against watching a movie after reading the book!I loved and impresed with James Mason in this role. "
5,Kristenfalsocapaldi,566,565,"I have been meaning to read Lolita for some time now, and I have to be honest, I wasn't overly impressed. Besides the ""ick"" factor, which was an initial deterrent, there is just a lot of how do I put this? Down time in the novel. There is a lot of ""we drove here, then we drove here, we bought this, we bought that, we settled here..."" I started to feel like I was reading a travel-log. I don't know what I expected. I didn't find his prose particularly beautiful. I certainly didn't think of it as a love story, as the back cover suggested I should. It picked up in the last stages of the novel, but by then I was just trying to get through it. For the record, I hate having to give so-called classics a luke-warm review, but I just wasn't feeling it. I mean, the first line is killer, and there are some great lines throughout, and Humbert is creepy and obsessive, but overall, not my favorite. "
5,Walter,568,567,"Ugg. This book quickly became boring and monotonous. I really liked it up until Hayes was hit by the car. I thought Humbert was an excellent narrator, his thought process was fascinating, and the language and story-telling was enthralling. And then they drove around the country, it became a weird, dark, mystery, and after he lost Lolita I just didn't care at all what happened with the rest of the book. It was a chore to finish."
5,Taha Brahim,571,570,une valse au bord de la perversité 
5,GalwayGirl,576,575,"Listened to Jeremy Irons read this which is probably what made me finish. Overall a very disturbing, complex and creepy insight into the mind of a very twisted person. Often went on too much with endless details which perhaps add to the creepiness of the main character, sometimes fascinating but often just too much. Excellent narration, really expertly read and this added much to a book I probably would've given up on if I was reading it myself. "
5,Tang,577,576,"I have been thinking about what to write. It's not a hard book to read, not at all. On the contrary, i read it pretty easily. I din't like Lolita though. I don't know if i was supposed to dislike Humbert more. I couldn't see him as a villain, never did. Don't get me wrong. Humbert wasn't sane, obviously. He had that obsession with Lolita, but he never tried anything until she came forward. He was loving her in his own way. May i say harmless way? The problem came when they started having a ""relationship"". Neither of them were in their right minds, both being manipulative and false. The end was kind of foreseeable. I gave the book 2 stars, mainly because of the strangeness of the plot."

5,Filipa,588,587,"(I guess it goes without saying, but still)TRIGGER WARNING for child abuse/ pedophiliaThis book is soperbly written. The story is approached as a memoir (almost a journal with the amount of extensive and meticulous detail) told through its main character, Humbert Humbert. Nevertheless it's really hard to focus on the book's achievements when it approaches such a strong and sensitive topic that keeps you on the verge of throwing up every other page and hoping the narrator would implode from the first to the last paragraph. All because Humbert (and the other characters as well) are well structured and believable. He (Humbert) meticulously describes his disease - only being able to feel sexually aroused by nymphets - and his particular obsessession with Lolita. The word nymphet, which is thrown around so much through the book, is to me a way of victim blaming in itself. Especially since the narrator is 'aware' of the harm he's done but still seeks his redemption, partially by implying he couldn't help himpself. Despite Nabokov's outstanding job at taking us on a journey into the mind of this conniving professor - with his doubts, fears, and schemes to manipulate and abuse a child without being caught - that's still not enough to make me like this book as a whole, hence the two stars."

5,Cheryl Houston,600,599,"Well, the best thing I can say is it was well written. I wouldn't call it an enjoyable read, but it was strangely compelling."
5,Emil Fanache,603,602,"I would rather call it ""The boring travel journal of a pedophile"". I think everyone's looking for an excuse to give it a higher note just because is controversial and is written by Nabokov. I read reviews where people say ""Poor Humbert, you become the witness of his suffering"". How about the girl? She clearly did not love him with that mature level, she was an infant. She was manipulated and scared (see the things he said about her calling the police which would have resulted in her being alone in an institution). She wouldn't have run if it was pleasant for her. Think about the fact she behaved abnormally at school unlike other girls of her age. She was mentally and sexually abused. Since she was the one caught, how come many people call this a love story? However, the subject doesn't make it a bad book. What I hated most was the loooong listing of hotels, motels, descriptions of places. The constant ramble and surplus paragraphs which made me struggle with many pages. The only thing I found enjoyable about this book was the way the writer talked to the reader, the easiness of his constant conversation, making us the jury of his own mental process. Hence the two stars! A huge waste of time!"
5,Carolina  Proença,605,604,"Why is this a classic, again? I just think it is plainly nothing. I like Nabokov's writing and subtle descriptions of what could be considered vulgar, but the story is not interesting at all and Humbert's mind and personality are so disturbing and vicious. I don't get why so many people love this book. "
5,د.أحمد فايز,606,605,معظم الرواية هو وصف للعلاقة الجنسية بين رجل ناضج وطفلة والاشتهاءات والخيالات الجنسية لهذا الرجل. رواية إلى حد ما مقلقة وربما مقرفة. بغض النظر عن الأسلوب الحكوي والحبكة.
5,Ginger *Protégée extraordinaire and Kool-Aid mixer*,608,607,"I am going to make another attempt at this one with the help of Stepheny, Delee and Kristin beginning in January.Lets do this!**update**Only reason why I made it through this book:I don't really know what to say. Once again my rating is based on MY enjoyment of the book.I put it up to two stars because = prose. The way a very 'ugly' story was told beautifully. H.H. loved Lolita. Had she not been 12 (and he hadn't kidnapped her oh and the forcing himself on her and... yeah the list is long) this would have been beautiful.It says something that the Nabokov can make the reader forget that we are traveling with a horribly disgusting individual. I even enjoyed parts of the book. It was an interesting study on the writing style but I honestly did not like the book, and I want to send H.H. through the seven gates of hell.PS For an excellent review check out Karly's thoughts.https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."

5,Amit Behal,618,617,"Perverse, obnoxious"
5,Livvy,625,624,"Despite the great reviews I heard for this book, I wasn't very impressed. I understand it is supposed to be this big love story that looks past age, but I couldn't get past that. The whole thing seemed creepy and perverse, and there were many times I wanted to just put the book down and not finish. I do agree, it was excellent writing and the author was obviously very talented, but the topic was just too far out for me. I can understand why this may be considered a classic, but for me I could barely get through it."
5,Maureen,627,626,Too disturbing for me. 
5,Neena Joy,629,628,"This book was flat out weird.....it was well written, but grew more and more disturbing as the plot continued to unfold. Also, I wish the author revealed Dolores' point of view because her character was complex. "
5,Annmarie,630,629,"Yes, this book is very well written. The language flows in a way you wouldn't expect from someone who is not a Native English speaker (I'm pretty sure he wrote it in English, not Russian. But I can't remember where I heard/read that so I might be making it up). It also didn't hurt that Jeremy Irons narrated the audiobook version.However, I just don't have the sympathy that others have for the main character, and I cannot view it as a love story no matter how hard I try. I'm glad I read it so I can check of my list of classics to read, but I feel a little like I missed something and a little like I need a shower..."
5,Taylor Parsons,632,631,"The first half of this book was stellar, but around the time of Lolita's absence, Humbert went a little manic and insane. The writing style was easy to negotiate if French is also in your vocabulary, but one can still understand the mutterings of Humbert Humbert even without a knowledge of French. The second half of this book is quite strange and one wonder why Humbert thinks in the manner that he does. B- nevertheless."
5,Denise Cameron,636,635,"I had huge problems with this book. I loved the writing style, but I couldn't get my head around the characters. From start to finish I hated Humbert, which disappointed me because I was expecting something to happen to redeem him. As for Dolores, at first I pitied her, then I realized I really didn't like her, but I still pitied her, and wondered why Humbert was obsessed with her since he didn't actually like her, he just liked the idea of her and her physical self. I wouldn't have called this a love story. "
5,Book Kisser,639,638,"Beautifully written but any way you write it, he is still a pedifile and a nymphette is still a child; I could not get past that."
5,Aichurek Zhunusova,640,639,I did not like it. from the very beginning. I knew I will not like the plot. but I've heard that the language is beautiful and was expecting at least an interesting writing. nothing. this old man is disgusting.
5,Erik,643,642,"Well this started out so promising, with some really great writing to begin with.Once the meandering around the country started, however, I couldn't go on. Simply too bored to finish. I wanted to yell at the author: GET TO THE POINT.Likewise, the writing is all very coy. Sex happens, and I miss it. While I understand that such censoring was necessary back when this was written, I'm afraid that my modern tastes find it all very disruptive, unappealing. I want to hear the story, not some behind-the-curtain facsimile of it.My suggestion: read the first hundred pages. If you can continue, power to you. If you don't, drop it for something better and strike it from your list of Books To Read Before You Die."
5,Kyren,646,645,"Missed out on this one as highschool required reading. Sort of glad, so far I think it would have disturbed me too much as a highschooler...This book has been called a controversial love story. First of all, it is clearly not a love story, the protagonist is a sociopathic pedophile who aside from his lust seems to have no positive feelings toward Lolita at all what so ever. He not only violates her physically but mistreats her throughout the entire book with his unwarranted overbearing ""parenting"" and dishonesty.I think I disliked the central character so much that it made me difficult to enjoy the book. I suppose that could be considered a tribute to Nabokov as a talented writer, but there were definitely parts of the book that were written so stylized and so accurately in Humbert's arrogant prose that it was simply irritating to read.The fact that this story is a memoir by the unreliable narrator leads all of the characters to be imprinted buy his foul personality, there is no relief from Humbert's voice and presence, its unnerving.Nabokov has said, ""I happen to be the kind of author who in starting to work on a book has no other purpose than to get rid of that book,"" and frankly that's how I felt reading it. I wanted to get my hands clean of it but refused to surrender to leaving it incompletely read. I looked forward to finishing it so I could read something else.I gave it two stars. one, for the skill that must be acknowledged in creating a character so detestable and bringing out such negative emotion in the reader. The second star is for chapters 35 and 36 of part 2, the final 2 chapters of the book, which I honestly found to be quite entertaining, and the only ones that, for me contained any of the ""humor"" I had been promised in other reviews."

5,Paul Groinus,648,647,"The flowery, descriptive prose made this book a hard read for me. Snippets of French, references to alien literary works, and subtleties that I don't think I picked up on half the time added to my difficulty.I can understand the main character's passion though, as I can vividly recall the tide of emotions that raked my soul during my own adolescent loves. A different time (in which everyone died young), a different culture and mood, who knows what may have been in centuries past? Another time (when everyone died young), another culture and mood, who know what secrets the past holds? Now it is just too taboo. I imagine a group of enraged church ladies banding together to burn this book.If you decide to crack this one open, be patient with yourself. It is a devil of a read."

5,Chester Dean,669,668,"De esos libros que pensé me iban a fascinar, pero me pasé toda la lectura forzándome para acabarla porque nunca me atrapó."
5,Strawberry Fields,670,669,"I have been deliberating very much on what to say about this book, so I will just express my feelings and observations as they come to me.First of all, I am a lover of ""classic"" books, and this is one I had never read, perhaps out of my own prudish feelings about the subject matter. However, I decided to give it a try to see what all the hype was about and just basically to be able to say, ""Yeah, I read it."". I expected a lot of graphic sex and that was certainly not the case. Most of the sex scenes were more implied than anything else, and what few the reader is given details, it is not explicit at all. There are no curse words to be found anywhere in the book.What captured my attention throughout was trying to figure out Humbert and what drives his obsessions, as most of us must wonder about sexual predators. He justifies his actions vehemently from cover to cover, which in my mind says he knew what he was doing was wrong. One doesn't have to justify what he feels is acceptable. He seems to blame a lot of his behavior on Lolita herself. While she is certainly no angel herself, he as the adult had a responsibility to curtail that. In his weakness he succumbs which in his mind gives him an out on his own personal behavior. All this being said, it is easy to see Humbert as a rational personal who is truly in love. He manages to suck you in at times into believing that he is not such a bad guy, as deplorable as his actions are.What I didn't like about the book was that it was incredibly ""wordy"". Some paragraphs were several pages long. It was easy to get lost in the verbiage although the word play was very captivating. In addition, much of the book was in French with no translations given. I took French in high school roughly 30 years ago (giving away my age!) and I was able to decipher enough to get the general gist of what was being said but not a full accurate translation. I would think that a reader who knows nothing of the language would find this very frustrating.Overall, I feel the book is over-hyped, and was not at all up to my expectations. I wanted to really like it, however I just couldn't muster up any more energy than to rate it a 2. I also feel that the book is overly demonized. As I read I really couldn't find much to be indignant about other than the subject matter itself, child molestation."
5,Martin Yankov,672,671,"It turns out Lolita is not my cup of tea. It’s really stylish, beautifully written, but apart from that, there’s nothing I could speak favourably of here. You may think I was too scandalized or disgusted by this novel – the truth is far worse. This book committed a greater crime to me as a reader – it simply bored me.I was intrigued at first. A bit scandalized, I admit, but mostly intrigued. The story started out slowly, but there was some weird tension, something was building up and I got the feeling it would explode in my face. Somehow it never did. After a hundred pages or so that tension just faded away. And then everything became too boring and I actually struggled to finish the novel. The ending was okay, I guess, but nothing exceptionally rewarding or satisfying.I never cared for the main character, not for a second. He was vain, haughty, shallow, he lacked empathy, he considered himself superior to everyone else. He saw other people as weak and pathetic. And he didn’t love – he didn’t truly love anything in this world. I could see why Nabokov once said something like “Why do you think I’m anything like my character? He doesn’t love butterflies.” That character doesn’t have a hobby, he doesn’t have a true passion – apart from his passion for young girls or more precisely their bodies – he doesn’t have friends, he doesn’t admire or respect a single human being. And he never loved Lolita. He had this obsession with her body, later with her persona, but it was always just that – weird obsession. He never actually liked her as a person, he always thought she was irritating. He never wanted to be with her – he wanted to be around her, he wanted to be her master, but nothing more. I can’t identify with that kind of person and maybe that’s why I can’t bring myself to care for that kind of person. And all the other characters, including Lolita, had just minor roles.And let me share one last thing about the writing style of that novel. Yes, the language is gorgeous and all the sentences indeed look wonderful. And yet… when I think about it, when I try to remember a single phrase or a quote that amazed me and stayed with me, I can’t think of anything. And that’s weird, because I always remember quotes and phrases from almost everything I read. So… for all its superficial beauty, the language in this novel couldn’t offer me a single memorable sentence! What a bummer! (This was not my discovery, actually. I discussed this novel in a book-club, and after I praised the writing style on multiple occasions, one person asked me “Okay, tell me a single quote that you remembered, a single sentence or thought that stayed with you”. And I thought of one or two ideas and concepts I enjoyed, but not a single actual sentence or line from the book. And then I truly accepted I was giving this writing way too much credit.)So… if you love this novel and you’re too mad at me for bashing it – please, don’t be. Even the best book can’t win the heart of every reader. "
5,russell barnes,673,672,"Hmmm, well I at least finished in time for Book Club - albeit I had to get the last few pages read in the car on the way. It was ""okay"" I suppose. I thought the most interesting bits were his description of their travels around America, given that world has pretty much disappeared. It is a book about love, but Nabokov deliberately muddies the waters with the paedophilia, which ultimately distorts peoples reactions. I could probably have done without the dense, pseudo-stream of consciousness prose as well. Everything just go lost in random French, cod-academia and perving.*Sigh* At least I can tick it off the ""books to read before you die"" list - Wolf Hall next!"

5,sam,677,676,"I'd somehow had managed never to have read any Nabokov by the age of 25. So when I finished Lolita yesterday, I was surprised not to have liked it more. The prose I found dull and schticky when it wasn't outright obnoxious. And well... isn't the prose why this book is so beloved? The caprice of the narration and the circumstantial humor (things like the consideration of drowning) sustained my interest slightly, but the sentiment and bloodshed at the end seemed overwrought, if amusing, afterthoughts. I don't intend to read more Nabokov terribly soon."
5,Megankellie,678,677,"Yes, a classic, yes. Beautifully written in parts, eys.But still, a guy humps preteens and loves humping preteens and talks about their downy hair.This is the first book I ever threw against a wall and felt nauseous about."

5,Haven Hightower,686,685,Barf. I need to take a shower after this one. 
5,Andrea Daniels,690,689,"I had to read this for a college class. Had it not been required, I would have given up on it after about 20 pages.Nabokov's writing, while eloquent, is designed to make the reader feel like an idiot, and he succeeds. He often has the characters randomly speak French, so unless you are bilingual, you will not understand entire paragraphs. He will also throw in characters without introduction, which forces the reader to stop and try to determine who exactly this person is. I found myself wondering often if I had missed something somewhere, but it turned out I had not, Nabokov just likes to mess with your brain.Humbert Humbert, the main character and narrator of the novel, is insane. He points out that he has spent several years in mental hospitals. There are several chapters where you can clearly tell he is descending into madness and paranoia. This makes it harder to determine which events of the novel are actual plot, and which are just hallucinations (think American Psycho, except less funny and more boring)."
5,Carol Meyer,691,690,"My edition of Lolita has the following quote from Vanity Fair on the cover ""the only convincing love story of our century."" I guess the 20th century was more cynical than I recall. I would hardly call the story of a mentally ill pedophile, his adolescent prey, and a serious of unsympathetic, mostly revolting supporting characters a love story. The back cover quote from Time--""wildly funny"" is equally strange. Lolita begins with the hunt, and ends with the meaningless murder of an ancillary character. Humbert's relationship with his stepdaughter is sandwiched between two road trips through America each linked by a series of cheap motels. The girl may be a flirt, but she is just a girl. He controls her alternatingly by bribery and threats. An early slow motion chase scene by Humbert's then-wife's French lover in a taxi is later echoed by a phantom convertible tailing Humbert and Lolita on their escapade.Granted, the final bumbling murder scene describes a conflict between two inept middle-aged men and has an element of humor to it (rather like the fight scenes between Mark Darcy and Daniel Cleaver in Helen Fielding's hysterical Bridget Jones books).Finally, though, the book is just sad. Humbert never gets to know anyone, not either of his wives, his post-Lolita companion, or Lolita herself. He is only interested in her body. She finds him boring and repulsive and protects herself with a veneer of disdain. He actively rejects any true human connection. Not funny. Definitely not a love story. "
5,Driss El,693,692,مهما قيل عن الرواية ،ومهما بدت مستهلكة ومتآكلة ،إلا أنه من خلال الجزء المقتبس منها في القيلم الذي عرض سنة 1997 باسم لوليتا،للمخرج أدريان لين،حيث يحكي عن انتقال رجل يبلغ من العمر 40 سنة ينتقل لبيت تتواجد فيه خادمة وزوجة وابنتها لوليتا ،وذلك بغية كتابة عمل أدبي ،وهكذا بدأ تدوين عدة ملاحظات حول الاعمال التي تقوم بها لوليتا داخل البيت ،والتي ما إن رآها أول مرة حتى نسي لماذا جاء لذلك البيت ،وبقيت مصدر اهتمامه الوحيد حتى نهاية المشوار،الفيلم يوضح شيئا واضحا هو مرض العجوز الذي تتحكم فيه غريزته الشيطانية الميّالة للفتيات المراهقات،ليعتبر كنوع من البيدوفيليا،والغريب في الأمر هو أن لوليتا هي من بدأ كل تلك القصة،بطبع قبلة على شفتي ذلك الحقير الذي كان عبدا لشهواته منذ البداية إلى اللحظة ما قبل الاخيرة،لم أفهم الرسالة التي أراد تبليغها الكاتب بالضبط،هل أراد توضيح مرض الشخص وهوسه بالفتيات الصغيرات،أم أن الفتاة التي تبلغ من العمر 14 سنة |،يمكن أن تقحم نفسها في مغامرة عاطفية مع شخص يكبرها ب 26 سنة،والتي في سابق الزمان ولحد الأن نجد الكثيرين ممن تزوجوا بمثل هذه السن،لكن الحماقة التي سبح فيها الكاتب ، لا تكاد تكون إلا سباحة في وحل ،لا يوصل إلى ضفة أخرى،بدون نتائج ولا حتى رسائل مهمة،غير أن علاقة عاطفية بين طفلة مراهقة وبين رجل أربعيني علاقة غير أخلاقية،ويعاقب عليها القانون ،كما يعاقب عليها الضمير ،وتكون النتيجة مكلفة جدا...وبين كل ما حدث لا يمكن إلا أن أقول بأن العلاقة في هذا الفيلم المقتبس من هذه الرواية تكاد تكون مثل العلاقة التي أقامها فلورينتينو أريثا وأميركا فيكونيا في رواية الحب في زمن الكوليرا للكاتب العملاق غابرييل غارسيا ماركيز الساحر...رغم كل الاحداث فالرسالة لم تصل كما ينبغي،كما أن علاقات من هذا النوع تكلف الثمن غاليا جدا ولو بعد حين.....
5,Kate Woods Walker,694,693,"To take the heretical view that Lolita, by the ostentatiously-learned and thankfully dead Vladimir Nabokov, is on a par with The Pedophile's Guide to Love and Pleasure, the recently-banished ebook by the hapless molester Philip R. Greaves II, is to place oneself in immediate risk of being labeled a literary Philistine, unable to appreciate the finely-tuned art of the male pedophiliac urge and its containment on a page. But I take such a view, happily.Of course Lolita is a well-written book. It is fourth on the Modern Library list of the 20th Century's greatest literary works, after all. But its placement at such a lofty height is more a testament to the power of patriarchal framing—where men have the right to satisfy their every urge and females and children are property—than its actual literary merit. Ultimately, however, it has no more artistic merit than Greaves's ""how-to"" because it is merely a fancy ""I-did.""It's a well-constructed lie within a lie within a lie within a lie. It's a sick joke. It's a pedophile's self-referential love story about himself, to himself. It's fantastically realistic because it is fantastically real. Any real-life Dolores or Charlotte can tell you so. As The Socially Skilled Child Molester by Carla van Dam can show you, there are no better liars on the face of the earth than child molesters, and there is no greater thrill for them than to get away with it. Imagine the Humbertian ego-gasm that resulted from committing a crime, dressing up the crime as art, publicly confessing the crime, returning to the theme of the crime over and over again, and having the crime judged one of the century's greatest acts.The reluctance by the literary world to see the crime—to instead howl about art vs. reality, writer vs. character, fact vs. fiction—is perhaps the writer’s biggest triumph. Oh, we can see and appreciate that John Irving has personal daddy issues, as we follow him from circus to circus. We can follow the theme of middle class families upended by violent crime in the works of Joyce Carol Oates. We can wrestle with Anne Rice’s personal religious quest. But Nabokov and pedophilia? Heaven forefend! The critical world has become the mother who does not see her husband’s hand up the daughter’s skirt, but sees instead the beautiful tailoring of the skirt and sleeve.And ultimately, despite its sledgehammer of erudition and its sheen of pretended allegory, Lolita fails as art because it becomes heavy with its own evil, banal and boring. Nabokov, with easy and familiar comparisons to regular pornography in his afterword, enumerates the many ways Lolita departs from and surpasses everyday porn. But it doesn’t. It merely dresses it up. And to this reader, that is an aggravating factor rather than a mitigating one."
5,Anna P,701,700,"Poetic in writing, but sickening in content. I don't care how artistically it's written or how beautiful the words. It's so unapologetic. Aesthetically, it's gorgeous. Psychologically, it's disturbed."
5,la tida,704,703,i was surprised to learn that the real lolita is a petite (irish) BRUNETTE (not a blonde). so she's the opposite of dom swain.
5,Oana M.,706,705,"I was expecting something else from this book, but it only proved to be very hard to digest."
5,Bianca,707,706,just wanted it to end towards the last part of the book.
5,Edith,708,707,"Lovely prose describing the mundane, which is fine for a hundred pages or so. Manages to render a scandalous plot rather placid. But it seems every literature snob has to read a Nabokov at some point. So I did it, and that's that."
5,Mimi,709,708,"Nabokov's way of writing is beautiful. BUT this book didn't do it for me; it's pedophilia. I couldn't get past that point. I'm sure I wouldn't have hated it as much as i do, had Nabokov not gone into so much detail. I know there's more to it all. Maybe it's all metaphoric or maybe it really is literal, i don't know."

5,Julieta,714,713,"Tal vez leí con demasiadas expectativas, pero no me convenció. Mi desafío era el de identificarme con un personaje tan opuesto a todo lo que soy, y solo pude lograrlo en una parte de la novela. No me pareció compleja la relación lolita-Humbert, lo único que rescato es la dualidad que está presente en todo momento y que es la que hace que en algún momento, sientas empatía hacia esos personajes y sus demonios. En algún punto vuelvo a la reflexión sobre la mente humana que tanto me preocupa, y Lolita me muestra una vez más que cualquiera puede transgredir, transgredirse, transgredirnos."
5,Xandretta,720,719,"Um... I only gave this two stars instead of one because it's a book that should be read. Did I enjoy it? No, not really. Strange and kind of creepy but a literary classic for a reason. "
5,Kristina Emmons,721,720,"I picked up Lolita because I'd been wanting to read more ""classics"". and as far as writers, I've heard high praise for Nabokov, but I honestly didn't know what I was in for with this one. Sometimes I'm amazed I finished it. The premise is so disturbing, the character's thoughts and actions so rash and detestable...I suppose I hoped the author would turn the man to repentence by the end of the book, that the entire reason for writing it was to highlight redemption. That Lolita is considered a classic is disturbing to me, content-wise. Is Nabokov a genius or simply mad?"
5,Laura Mooré,722,721,This really wasn't my cup of tea. It wasn't too 'disturbing' as many people have viewed it. There was no action or suspense and that's what I like in a book. 
5,Danny Stratton,725,724,Vlad was a perv. I don't really see why this is believed to be so wonderful. I read it. Not much else to say. 
5,Shimba,726,725,"I feel miserable at the fact I just couldn't get into this book despite all the great ratings and rave by ""Lolita"" enthusiasts. Aside from being very disturbing, I felt it was overly descriptive to the point it was 'dragging' on, becoming repetitive and simply ...boring."
5,Patricia,727,726,It started to get too creepy for my tastes
5,Divyanshu Pandey,736,735,"I started reading this book with great anticipation, this being among the top few novels in any and every list of 'great novels of all time'.But I was hugely disappointed and I don't understand why is there such a hype about this book. While the haters of the book may cite its controversial theme as a reason to hate the book, but I knew the theme ofcourse before reading and I am ok with that. But put aside the theme, the novel itself is utterly boring. Even from a literary point of view, it doesn't appear to be as great as it is often considered to be. In short, read it only for name sake, as such nothing special about this book."
5,Bridgid,737,736,"I don't understand why this is a book that is a must read. It was well written - yes. However, the book was about a pedophile. It was not a love story. It was about a man destroying the life of a young girl and dreaming about destroying the lives of many young girls. I was not a fan."
5,Leonie,738,737,"Listening to Jeremy Irons narrate this in his beautiful, hypnotic voice made me able to get through this book. I'm pretty sure if I was reading the printed version I couldn't have finished it. Some of the writing was really beautiful but other parts made me shudder with disgust."

5,Beth,759,758,"This book is Literature with a capital L. It has a reputation for being smut, but most of the book isn't about that. There are a million hints and references and themes etc. which makes the annotated version extremely helpful. In the end this is a many-layered book written for English majors to read and pick apart, and not for anyone's pleasure or insight. Overall, the awful details, plot and mood drag you down and ruin the rich word-play."
5,Daphine Muffinx,760,759,Easy to read but not easy to accept
5,Anne Lara,764,763,"I felt like I had to read this book, since it is so entrenched in our culture. I have to say I have really mixed emotions about it. It was extremely disturbing, as I expected. I was surprised, however, at how personally it affected me, in nightmares, etc. I thought some of the writing was amazing, and found the author's ability to get inside the complexities of the main character's thoughts very impressive. Part of me just wanted to get through it, and felt compelled to keep going, even though some of it was so disturbing, I wanted to stop reading. It was compelling, if just to find out what happened. But, in my rush to get through it, it seemed like I missed some details that left me a bit confused at the end. Not really sure how I feel about it. I'm glad that I read it, just to say that I read it. But I don't know if I would recommend it or read it again."
5,Carolyn,765,764,you aren't going to like this...I was warned that I wouldn't like it and I didn't!
5,Keelin,767,766,"I read this because because it was on the All-TIME 100 Novels list. The writing in the book was great. The descriptions were beautiful, and I really felt with the narrator. Unfortunately, the narrator is a huge creep, which is ultimately why I gave this book 3 stars. I knew what I was getting into, but in the end, I just felt really creeped out and bummed. So my shortened summary would read something like ""Compelling, enthralling writing, but in the end, I was left with a grossed-out, creeped-out feeling."""
5,Julie Schuch,768,767,"I found myself getting really angry about this book. I am not sure why it is hailed as a ""classic"" when in fact most parts are plain sick!Humbert Humbert never recovers from losing his first love to Typhoid (although they were 11/12 & never got around to consummating their love), so plods through his life constantly desiring ""Nymphets"" as he calls them.....which are 11/12 year old girls that are sexually aware!!He marries a woman, only to be close to her daughter......even imagines impregnating the mother so that when 9 months are up and she is away to give birth, he can have his way with Lolita, the daughter!!!The mother dies and Humbert is entrusted with this young lolita whom he immediately removes from school & travel from town to town, hotel to hotel, and have sexual relations along the way. Lolita falls ill and is left in hospital to recover (reluctantly by her abuser) where she disappears.Humbert searches for years, eventually finding her pregnant, married and poor - yet not by her kidnapper, Quilty, whom is mentioned the book throughout - Quilty left her well before as she refused to do porn with him and his friends...... Humbert begs her to return to him but she refuses, so he leaves her money and departs, determined to track down Quilty. When found, Humbert shoots Quilty, killing him. Humbert is arrested and put in jail, where he continues to write his memoir, stipulating that it can only be published upon Lolita’s death. After Lolita dies in childbirth, Humbert dies of heart failure, and the manuscript is published.......sick.......twisted.........just wrong on so many levels!!!!!!"

5,Susanne,776,775,"I found this story disturbing on so many levels; I don't know where to start. Viewing this as another book that ""everyone should have read,"" I decided to read it as well. For one thing, I was repulsed by the fact that I felt a sort of sympathy for Humbert, as I might feel toward anyone with a degenerative disease. Toward the end of the story, that sympathy evaporated and I felt nothing but disgust and pity for his obsession. I felt both pity and judgment toward Lolita for being something more complicated than a victim. I admire Nabokov's ability to write about such a twisted subject without using perverse vocabulary as well -- I felt the story was masterfully told, and were it not for a few one-line zingers that clearly and succinctly laid bare the circumstances in which the two main characters lived their lives, I might have finished the book without ever feeling nauseous."
5,Shana ,778,777,"My god I expected to love this book! But half-way through the narrative took a dive for me and never recovered. I actually quit with about ten pages to go, I was that bored. So many French phrases! So much self-referential wit that went over my unappreciative head! The ""love story"" part of it was too one sided and the outcome lacking the gory dramatics I'd hoped for after such a belabored tale. I'm glad it's over with, much like Lola was. "

5,Lou Buran,788,787,I thought it would be interesting to read how the author treated such a terrible subject but found it repulsive despite the lovely language. Wasn't discomforting in a good way. Was more repulsive than strangely intriguing.

Setidaknya lewat tokoh dalam cerita ini kita bisa tahu bagaimana mengenali gelagat seorang pedofil dan bagaimana berupaya menjauhinya. Dengan isiannya yang sedikit terkesan provokatif dengan imajinasi dan nafsu sang tokoh, tampaknya wajar jika novel ini sempat dilarang beredar di Amerika Serikat.

5,Molly McManis,799,798,"I'm sure some people think Lolita is a great book; I, however, found it to be creepy and pretty boring up until the very end. It's taken me several weeks to get through this one. I would not recommend it to anyone, classic novel or not."
5,Ryan Scicluna,808,807,You might not necessarily share the same views as those of the narrator but you have to admit that this is a dark romantic tale. I can see in a twisted sort of way the beauty in writing this book as an idea that the narrator can be together with his love for eternity in the form of a literary art.
5,Zach,809,808,it made me uncomfortable.
5,Elizabeth (Betsy),814,813,Found the language difficult and was more engaged in the beginning than towards the end. Happy to check this classic off my list.
5,Cami,816,815,"Discussing this book with my book club was way more enjoyable than actually reading this novel. While I appreciate the literary devices and techniques Nabokov uses, the book was painful to get through. The subject matter was the most obviously difficult obstacle. Reading about a pedophile who's justifying why he's that way, and the relationship he has with a 12 year old is disturbing. But, perhaps the most disturbing part is the quote on the front of my book: ""The only true love story of our time."" I wholeheartedly disagree. This isn't a love story, it's a story of a sick man who only wants to be in relationships with adolescent girls. I can see how this novel became so famous-the controversial topic, his literary style, and the shock factor of reading a book from the perspective of a pedophile. I'm glad I have read and have some perspective on this classic, but I would not read it again. "
5,Denna,817,816,Strange
5,Maureen M,818,817,"I found it hard to get through this book. Nabokov masterfully took me into the mind of this deviant, and I think he accomplishes his goal in creating a disturbing picture of obsession and the damage to the girl. But while I give him that, I can't forgive him for it either. It's too creepy. "

5,Sarah Simmons,836,835,I totally could have skipped this classic. Ugh.
5,Mel,839,838,"Blegh. That's what I think of this story. And it was not necessarily the subject matter that makes me say that. This book was a long-winded lyrical story. I applaud Nabokov for his flowery writing and impressive vernacular usage. Some words I had even forgotten were in the English language. No, it was simply far too slow moving for me to be very entertained. Nonetheless, I did it, I read the whole damn thing."

5,Ruby,845,844,"While I know that this book is a well-loved classic, I found it really difficult to get into and almost impossible to understand n some places. Maybe this was Nabokov's writing style, but more likely it was that I was simply not in the right frame of mind to read this. Overall, I was kind of disappointed though.I did only give it two stars, but I do recommend giving it a go nonetheless - I'm definitely going to give it a reread in a few years."
5,Sophie Mitchell,846,845,"This book left me feeling in need of something more. At times it was a book I couldn't put down, but at other times I had trouble turning the page. Nabokov's style of writing was new and interesting to me, but didn't evoke the same emotions as other styles of writing which help you connect with the character. What I thought this book was lacking was character development. I was missing that simpathy and relatability that makes me want to cry or laugh or scream. I wanted the book to make me feel something, anything but it just made me want to finish quickly and move on to the next book on my forever growing list. Also the book was very very detailed to a point where I couldn't handle it any longer. If you are looking for a book that will give you an insight into the mind of a aging man's love for young girls, I wouldn't say this is the book for you because although it provides insight, I found the relationship hard to believe. Mainly because I found Lolita's character so unbelievable. But with that, I would still recommend the book. It is a classic and a classic for a reason so give it a try!"

5,Ercsi91,858,857,"A monolog of a pervert, middle-aged man,Humbert Humbert who talks about love. Rather we should talk about obsession for a 12 years old girl. Now this was one of those rare novels where I not only disliked but hated the main character, I couldn't find one characteristic of his which was supposed to be positive. But the other characters weren't interesting as well.He is so found of Lolita/Dolores like a mad man. I saw that this novel wasn't written in our century, it was more poetic than that( too poetic at some times).It represent quite good the tortured, insane soul of crazy people XD."
5,Jo Wake,863,862,OK
5,Alicia Beale,865,864,"When I was in high school, every morning my homeroom was in the early childcare class and my teacher was fairly conservative but in a fox news Oprah kind of way. She made oatmeal for us and offered motherly advice on our teenage crisis. One day, she asked us about the movie ""American Beauty"". She wanted to know which of us laughed at the movie because if we laughed and didn't like it then it showed how our morals reacted defensively against the immorality displayed in the film. This idea has stayed with me through life and I think about it as I now write about ""Lolita"".I cringed while reading ""Lolita"", possibly because I am too immoral for the morality within the book. My generation and those coming after me have been exposed to sex and sexual deviation explicitly. We can say very blunt sexual terms freely and out loud. We have watched and giggled at sexual predators who are caught on reality tv shows. The voice that Nabokov gave to Humbert Humbert felt cheesy and made Humbert seem like a doofus who of course would go on the internet and eventually get caught by Chris Hansen on television. Vladmir Nabokov would have been repulsed by ""To Catch A Predator"" and most likely would have much more cutting things to criticize modern culture about than Jonathan Franzen, but this is the world that we live in now. Phrases such as ""fire of my loins"" and ""scpetre of my passion"" read more like bad Nora Roberts in the society where ""50 Shades of Gray"" was sold in supermarket check-out counters. "
5,Andrée,867,866,"A horrid tale of one man's desire for a twelve-year-old girl. Nabokov writes from Humbert Humbert's perspective, encouraging the reader to delve into the inner-workings of this sick and twisted mind, as it goes to any lengths and measures to win the affections of Lolita. I will break this book into three parts - the first, a compelling read, in a morbid sort of way. The reader is drawn into the sick world in an effort to watch how the events unfold, that Humbert may win his Lolita's heart. It was really quite shocking how fluidly the events unfolded, practically thrusting Lolita into his lap in a neat little package equipped with a gift bow. Much too easy, much too unbelievable; especially that it would be Lolita who seduced Humbert, and not Humbert that necessarily violated her without her consent. The second part really lost me completely. I felt bogged down and uninterested by their life on the road, and even moreso by Humbert's incessant worrying that Lolita might be playing him for a fool, and that he may lose her (which he does). Page after page after page described their travel adventures, and Lolita's fluctuating moods. It became all too tiresome and, at one point, I put the book down for several days before deciding to give it another go. The third part picked up slightly, once Lolita had escaped Humbert's clutches. Though, the ending was an anti-climax. There wasn't much character development for Quilty, the man who 'kidnapped' Lolita from Humbert, so the 'betrayal' didn't hit home with the reader as much as it could have or should have. One may have felt that it would have been better for Humbert to exact his revenge upon himself. However, that Lolita had found love in her own way, and was living a better life than had been offered to her by Humbert was a comfort. Especially that Humbert granted her no grudge for having left him, and even provided for her and her husband, and the baby that was on its way. It doesn't necessarily make up for what he inflicted upon her, but it allows the reader to let go of the ordeal and try to move on.Despite the lurid events which took place within the novel, the driving force behind my own compulsion to continue reading the book was Nabokov's prose. The book was brilliantly written, and should be admired for that if anything else. "
5,Ali Adenwala,870,869,"If it weren't for the amazing writing style and the beginning, this book was have gotten one star.The beginning (the first 60-70 pages or so) was great, but somewhere along the way it got increasingly boring and repetitive, and for a long time nothing was really happening. There were  too  many descriptions (or completely irrevevant things) which, if cut down a bit, would have made the book a lot easier to read. Granted, all of these descriptions were very well written, but a pain in the ass to read over and over again, when all we want is the story to progress.And the rest is rust and stardust. "
5,Shaimaa Ali,872,871,"When I started reading ""Lolita"" I had a general idea what it was about, but kinda wanted to read the original work. Through fear & disgust I dived into this novel details..A very young HH in a love story, inspired by the legendary poem ""Annabel Lee"" - by Edgar Alan Poe, then losing his childhood's love and what a dreadful person he turned to be .. It was many and many a year ago,    In a kingdom by the sea, That a maiden there lived whom you may know    By the name of Annabel Lee; And this maiden she lived with no other thought    Than to love and be loved by me. The similarities - even in vocabulary - were so close, that I kept asking myself : but you didn't read Poe fully?!I was a child and she was a child,    In this kingdom by the sea, Both were young lovers, no love was enforced between them, no Rape!! I disliked the characters, all of them actually .. Even Nabokov logic itself, later on his commentary on the novel he was asked many times by the critics & readers alike why he wrote such a novel, basically, I was not convinced .. Defending it that no erotic scenes were there made it even worse cos he left all the savage details to your imagination! However, one can not deny Nabokov's genius ability to illustrate internal emotions of his main character .. HH defended his choice (loving a nymphet) by those lines: "" Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the majority of sex offenders that hanker for some throbbing, sweet-moaning, physical but not necessary coital, relation with a girl-child, are innocuous, inadequate, passive, timid strangers who merely ask the community to allow them to pursue their practically harmless, so-called aberrant behavior, their little hot wet private acts of sexual deviation without the police and society cracking down upon them. We are not sex fiends! We do not rape as good soldiers do. We are unhappy, mild, dog-eyed gentlemen, sufficiently well integrated to control our urge in the presence of adults, but ready to give years and years of life for one chance to touch a nymphet. Emphatically, no killers are we. Poets never kill.""I read this novel because it is one of English literature masterpieces, knowing that I won't like it. However, I didn't even like the writing style as it kept changing between English & French (with no translation) .. As if the writer is punishing us cos he didn't write in Russian ( he destroyed the original novella earlier & re-write this one). I won't talk about the Arabic translation cos a ""DISASTER"" would be an underestimation .. It was narrated, not translated with all the details stripped off .. "

5,Jillyn,875,874,"I understand why this is considering a ""good book."" However, I just couldn't get past the subject matter. There were many times that this book made me sick to my stomach & just plain uncomfortable! Humbert Humbert is a sick freak. He never truly loved Dolores. If he had, he wouldn't have done what he did to her! You didn't fool me Humbert."
5,Alex I.,877,876,"I give it 2 stars, not because of the subject manner but because I just didn't like the writing style. The style is very long winded and circles around which pulls you out of the book. I understand that this style is needed for the story, but I just couldn't get into it. I would put the book down and have to motivate myself to pick it up to continue reading, that is not what I want for a book. However, I am glad that I read it since it has become such a cultural reference."
5,Kristi Dixon,879,878,"While I appreciate the literary quality of the book, I struggled to get through it. And what good is a book if it is not intriguing and enjoyable at some level. I started this book thinking it was going to be extremely interesting. Afterall, what could be more fascinating than glimpsing into the mind and rationale of a pedophile? But really, it turned out to be terribly boring and repetitive. The afterward was my favorite part of the book."

5,Andrew Lienhard,893,892,"I was lied to in my youth (MTV, Reagan) by a young man named Gordon who, while prancing about in a British school teacher's robe, bemoaned a certain situation with a young student:""just LIKE thatold MAN in that BOOK by NAB-o-kov""The lie was in the pronunciation. But then, had he shifted the sylLABles to the correct ""naBOKov,"" he would have destroyed the meter, and as we know Gordon likes his meter. Still, I have forever pronounced the author's name incorrectly because of it.It took me two weeks to get through this novel. Part of it was the initial horror of the subject matter (""am I really reading this?""). Then, there's the writing itself. NaBOKov's controversial work is, above all else, a jungle of literary tricks. Realizing this (or being advised as such), I switched to the Annotated edition when I reached Part II. Doing so consolidated that which I had been Googling anyway: definitions, translations, parodies. There's the obvious, the ""Lo and Behold"" jokes (""Lo"" = ""Lola""), and there's the arcane (James Joyce, James Joyce, James Joyce). When you see the full range of riddles and references enumerated as they are in the Annotated Lolita, you appreciated the depth of NaBOKov's writing. ""Lolita"" is not for the casual reader. It proved a tremendous challenge for someone like me--not a literary scholar. But with guidance of the notes and Yale online sessions (three!), it was quite rewarding.5 stars for the writing, the genius of it. Negative 3 for the subject matter and asshole writing style. 2 overall.Now about those butterflies...."

5,Duha,901,900,نجمتان. الأولى لأن الأحداث بالرغم من بذائتها و جرئتها و قذارتها، حملتني على اتمام الكتاب حتى آخر كلمة، فقط لأعرف مصير القذر همبرت. والأخرى لأن النهاية ارضتني نوعاً ما. لكن الرواية ككل كتلة من القذارة و الإباحية التي لم أجدها في أي كتاب. قززتني و في كثير من الأحداث شعرت بالغثيان لمجرد تخيل أن رجلاً بالغاً يرمق فتاةً بهذة النظرة الوحشية القذرة! وما زادني صدمةً أن الفتاة من أوقعت نفسها بحباله و بكامل إرادتها و رغبتها. أكاد أجزم أن نبتت لي عضلات في جبيني و أسفل حاجبيّ نظراً لأني رفعتهما طوال اليومين الذين قضيتهما في قراءة الرواية.. وإنني شد نادمة على ذلك. 
5,Emily Crowe,902,901,"Warning: Spoilers abound. From the little I knew about Lolita before I picked it up, it was not really a book I ever wanted to read. But while I'm not above judging a book by its cover, I decided that I shouldn't judge Lolita without at least dipping into it first. Many people I know love this book. Writer friends and acquaintances frequently include it on their Top Ten lists. Plus I've been saying to myself that I need to start reading a little Russian literature. How can one be well-read without reading any of the Russians? One day while changing the sheets in our guest bedroom I noticed the Vintage paperback edition of Lolita on the shelf and said to myself, What the hell? It helped that this one was only 300 pages long. I started the book that night and had to force myself several times throughout to finish it. My husband kept teasing me about it: ""you must really love that book, the way you're tearing through it."" But he couldn't be more wrong. I was appalled, almost from start to finish. What I found inside these pages was actually far worse than what I had imagined.If, as many people claim, the intention of literature is to disturb, then by golly, this book is literature. But that's a load of codswallop, in my opinion. I think great literature can be disturbing, but for me, the point of reading is to create empathy. And it's not that I turn away from disturbing fiction. I have long admired works by Toni Morrison (The Bluest Eye and Beloved), Cormac McCarthy (all of 'em) and D. M Thomas (The White Hotel), and they're nothing if not disturbing. But they're also full of humanity, depth, spirit, and redemption--none of which Lolita had for me. Lolita started off well enough, dubious confession from the narrator aside. Humbert Humbert falls in love with a girl at the seaside and has his first sexual encounter with her. Fine. Annabel is ""a few months my junior,"" as Humbert recounts. Annabel's premature death results in what can only be called arrested development, because thereafter Humbert is only sexually attracted to young girls. So far, it's about what I expected. But then Humbert receives a peculiar inheritance that stipulates he must live in America to benefit, and shortly thereafter the bile rose in my throat on a regular basis. He only boards with Mrs. Haze after seeing her 12 year old daughter sunbathing in the backyard. From there he keeps a diary of his lustful thoughts about Dolores, whom he calls Lolita. She, in turn, has a crush on handsome Humbert. One day when they're alone he pulls her onto his lap and masturbates against her. But it's when he fantasizes about a sleeping pill strong enough that he could rape Lolita without waking either her or her mother that I grew most disgusted. He goes so far as to experiment with different strengths of pills and is disappointed that they don't seem to work.Ugh--fast forward through Humbert's marriage to Mrs. Haze and her subsequent death. He is now Lolita's sole guardian, and after that point he molests the girl on a daily basis and threatens her with dark tales of deprivation and group foster care to hold her silence. And yet Humbert persistently sees himself as the victim in their scenario: ""There is nothing more atrociously cruel than an adored child."" Yeah, poor guy. Long story short: they take a year-long road trip, staying in a different motel each night so that nobody will suspect Humbert of raping his step daughter. And so that Lolita will not know anybody well enough to confide what is happening to her. Eventually they settle down and she goes to an all-girls boarding school. When she wants to go out with her girlfriends, Humbert requires extra sexual favors from him and he gets upset that she performs desultorily. Huh. Go figure. Then she's in a play after which he abducts her and they go on another long road trip. One night Lolita gets so sick she must be hospitalized and Humbert, in his usual martyred voice says, ""giving up all hope of intercourse, I wrapped her in a laprobe."" Helluva guy, that Humbert.Lolita is then abducted/rescued from the hospital by a man claiming to be her uncle. Humbert then spends the rest of his inheritance criss-crossing the US trying to find them. He doesn't. But one day he gets a note from Lolita asking for money--she's pregnant and she needs money to move to Alaska. Humbert shows up, with murderous thoughts, and only gives up the money in exchange for the name of the person who liberated her, whom he tracks down and kills, for which crime he narrates this tale from prison, stipulating that it not be published 'til after his death. The end.So, what I want to know is how this book has become such a milestone of American letters, so canonized, so revered? The cover of the book proclaims, ""The only convincing love story of our century (Vanity Fair)."" Um, did they read the same book I did? This is a novel dedicated to the abomination of love. I wonder if the same reviewer would call Mein Kampf ""the only convincing political tract of our time.""Nabokov is frequently regarded as ""one of the twentieth century's master prose stylists"" (from the back cover), and there were times when I thought the writing was quite good. And of course the fact that he is so facile with a language beyond his native tongue is a remarkable feat and praiseworthy all on its own. But there are also long passages where the text meanders so much that it's hard to tell up from down. Here's one such example, where Humbert is describing nymphets, the word he coins to describe those girls on the cusp of reaching sexual maturity, to whom he exclusively attracted: ""Neither are good looks a criterion; and vulgarity, or at least what a given community terms so, does not necessarily impair certain mysterious characteristics, the fey grace, the elusive, shifty, soul-shattering, insidious charm that separates the nymphet from such coevals of hers as are incomparably more dependent on the spatial world of synchronous phenomena than on that intangible island of entranced time where Lolita plays with her likes.""For this reader, at least, the prose does not elevate the subject to the point of literature, and I confess it bothers me still, three weeks after completing this novel, that the sexual abuse and coercion of children is somehow legitimized by this book's canon status. It's not that books like this are published--I believe in the free market and publishing works uncensored. It's the fact that important writers, even feminist writers, elevate the pedestal this book stands on that bothers me. If it were instead a cult classic, maybe something along the lines of Bret Easton Elli's American Psycho, another book that I know would disturb me and thus will never read, I could rest more easily. I know that many of my blog's followers must have read this book. I'd love you to engage me a dialogue about Lolita with your thoughts on the subject, as I feel fairly sure I hold a minority view on this novel."
5,Roger Angle,903,902,"Boring. I don't get what all the hoopla has been about, all these years. When Humbert finally gets around to seducing the girl, she takes over and wants him, of all things. So it is almost like he isn't committing a crime, which lets the air out of the story. Then there is the world's longest most boring travelogue. Snore. "
5,Dana Davis,904,903,"This book was definitely well written, however I thought it was pretty boring. I guess I'm just not interested in an older man's sexual feelings for a child."
5,Laila,905,904,"I tried.I gave it 50-ish pages, which is my rule if I'm not feeling a book. I can see why critics revere this novel - the writing is excellent. But the subject matter is creepy at best and revolting at worst. Couldn't make myself do it."
5,Alee,909,908,"Dark and disturbing, but like a train wreck you can't help but look at. I thought the prose was too poetic and bombastic, would have been 4-5 stars if a good editor made it easy to read and follow."
5,Nadinastiti,914,913,"Two things I realized when finishing Lolita for the second time yesterday: first, I was really really really innocent the first time I read this book. Second, you will never really hate someone if you had read their thoughts and views (remind me of Atticus Finch's quote!) The story? Well, it's about Humbert Humbert, a man who sees Annabel, his very first love, in Dolores Haze, a nymphet. I agree with those who say that Lolita is ""a story about the exploitation of a weak adult by a corrupt child, and not the corruption of an innocent child by a cunning adult"". Maybe because Nabokov told the story first-person, and he never give us any of Dolores/Lolita's view. We'll never know how sweet Lolita was, but you will hate the Lolita character instantly.So, now I understand the whole story. I can't say I liked it, but I will say that it gives me an unusual experience. Mixed language (with french); how Humbert Humbert always change to Humbird, Humburg, and else; the Humbert-wrote-it-while-waiting-for-the-execution format; and many more.After all, it's a classic. You should read it for the sake of experience."
5,Felicia,916,915,"The writing wasn't something I was used to, it was odd to me. I don't know any French so that did not help.The book just wasn't for me, I don't see the appeal. It's hard to put into words how I feel about it."
5,Val,917,916,"Honestly, once I reached section 2 of the book it got boring. Section 1 was about Hubert’s history, motivation, how he meets Lolita and finally acquires her. Section 2 is about their miserable life together traveling from one city to another. I didn't even finish the last few chapters but i'm still crossing it off my list. I'm sure i'll go back and finish it someday but it's not a high priority."
5,Elly,922,921,"this is obviously a brilliantly written book. i knew from the beginning i wouldn't love it, and wasn't ever convinced otherwise. the self obsession of the narrator was just too overwhelming for me."

Era óbvio também o devia fazer.Nas primeiras páginas apaixonei-me de imediato pela escrita de Nabokov. O homem é um génio.Mas com o avançar da história, a sombra da pedofilia, a forma como Humbert fala da Lolita, começou-me a entrar debaixo da pele e honestamente tive muitas dificuldades em me ""distanciar"", em relevar, e só continuar a ler…A escrita continuou a encantar-me e a fazer-me virar páginas… no entanto, existiram dúvidas que se juntaram e esta leitura: Uma boa / excelente escrita é motivo suficiente para ignorar-mos valores morais e continuar a ler?Em que ponto é que está a linha que não deve ser atravessada?Este é o primeiro livro do qual não sei o que dizer.""Leste?""""Sim.""""O que achaste?""""…ainda estou a tentar perceber.""liliana"
5,Lese.tek,928,927,"Von traumatischen Ereignissen geschlagener Psychologiestudent entwickelt ganz im Sinne Freuds eine Pädophilie. Um seine Angebeteten unbemerkt näher zu kommen, heirarte er ihre verwitwete Mutter, die schließlich bei einem Autounfall ums Leben kommt. Rasch holt Humbert Humbert (ein Name von zahlreichen Synonymen für sich selbst)seine Lolita aus dem Sommercamp, in dem sie erste sexuelle Erfahrungen gesammelt hat, ab und beginnt mit ihr einen kilometerlangen Roadtrip durch ganz Amerika. Lolita spiegelt die typische ""femme entfant"" wieder, verführend und Verderben bringend. Während ihr Ziehvater und Sexpartner Humbert krank ist, flüchtet Lolita schließlich mit ihrer großen Liebe, ebenfalls einem älteren Herrn, der sie aber nach kurzer Zeit ablehnt. Humbert entwickelt weitere Psychosen und Paranoia und wird von Rachephantasien an Lolitas Geliebten geplagt. Nach 3 Jahren findet er Lolita endlich wieder und ist von ihrem Zustand entsetzt. Sein Nymphchen ist erwachsen geworden, schwanger und kann nur noch in Erinnerungen (in seinem Tagebuch) erotische Phantasien hervorrufen. Schuld daran gibt er dem älteren Geliebten, dr einzig großen Liebe Lolitas. Letztendlich besucht er diesen und es kommt zum Kampf der pädophilen älteren Herren.Das Ganze zieht sich schrecklich lange hin, es gibt seitenlange Ortsbeschreibungen, passieren tut, trotz provozierendem Themas, aber nicht viel. Da kann auch die hoch-literarische Sprache und psychoanalytische Selbstreflexion, die die freudianischen Theorien auf die Spitze treibt, nicht mehr viel dran reißen."
5,Catarina,933,932,"Honesty I wish I could rate this book better. The writing is beyond amazing, it's dreamy, you lose yourself in it and forget you're reading a book. The story however I can't understand how it appeals to so many people. To me it seems as though only pedophiles could actually take pleasure reading this. I don't always need to identify myself with a book to like it but this one is way over board, it just repulsing.Regardless, I think I'll give it another shot in the future.ps - I didn't finish it and I know that could be why I didn't like it."
5,Fiona,934,933,I tried but I just don't think I have the reading muscle for this. Maybe I should have read the annotated version. Or maybe I just don't care. 
5,Catherine Pye,938,937,"Didn't like it, made for uncomfortable reading."
5,Joshua Perna,942,941,"My God, what a cringe-worthy book. If it wasn't for Nabokov's jaw-droppingly beautiful writing style, this book would've been dropped instantaneously. The disgusting emotional abuse (and sexual intimacy) toward a 12-year-old exhibited by the novel's protagonist is actually less disappointing than just how boringly all of the novel's loose ends are tied up. But, in all honesty, I will be re-reading sections just to pick up pointers on how to weave a gorgeous narrative."
5,Sylvia,944,943,"The story has been told a million times, and arguably this is the best known rendition. Nabokov is, of course, a great writer. It doesn't mean I like the subject."
5,Ovie Nurbaity,951,950,"agak miris ya ceritanya karena seorang ayah suka kepada anak tirinya. kalo ini terjadi di indonesia maka org itu bisa dibilang cabul gak? haha pedopil banget karena dari judulnya aja udah ketauan ""lolita"" yg berarti dibawah umur 12 tahun. than endingnya mereka menikah dan mempunyai seorang anak. aku gak gitu suka sih ceritanya. malah menurutku doleres keras kepala. dan mereka not perfect couple."
5,Gary Patella,952,951,"This book always seems to be rated very highly. For me, those high ratings are a mystery. I believe that I am fairly well-educated, and my vocabulary is definitely above average. But the words used by Nabokov were absolutely ridiculous. Every few pages had me rifling through the dictionary. This really disrupted the flow of reading, and made the experience quite unenjoyable.Furthermore, there is not much to the story. Assuming that one is able to gloss over the excessive use of unnecessarily erudite words, the story is not anywhere near as great as others claim. It isn't a bad story, but it is certainly unworthy of the high praise it receives.In summary:1. The large words detract from the story and come off as pretentious. 2. The story itself is mediocre at best.3. This book is HIGHLY overrated."
5,Patty,955,954,"Good writing, just not what I enjoy that much."
5,Wonhee Park,959,958,"I always wondered what it feels like to read a book where I cannot relate to the narrator at all. Now I know. And it's not a great feeling. There are glimmers of humor in this dark, depressing book and even in those parts, I wondered if it was okay to laugh or if that little laughter might damn me. I read the book mostly because I was curious as to why the book was so controversial. And that curiosity has been satisfied. "
5,Colleen,960,959,"While I recognize Nabokov's genius as a writer, I just couldn't get past the fact that the narrator is a pedophile. I really need to attempt another of his books."
5,Lalita,961,960,I did not find Nabokov very compelling. 
5,Joan,962,961,"As a parent and an elementary school teacher, the pedophile character in this story, though vividly portrayed with excellent writing, was too much for me. "

5,James Maxey,966,965,"I can understand why a lot of people think highly of this book, since the writing is very evocative and there's a certain courage required of an author to delve this deeply into the psyche of such and unsympathetic main character. I admired the book up to the point where Lolita herself is introduced. Then, the book suffered from some really hard to swallow lucky breaks that were necessary to take the plot to where Nabokov wanted it to go. First, it's not Humbert's idea to marry Lolita's mother in order to get closer to the girl, the mother instead throws herself at him and insists on marriage. Then, when the mother learns that Humbert is a pedophile, she runs across the street to mail a letter exposing him and is immediately run over by a car and killed. Then, when he goes to pick up Lolita with the scheme of kidnapping her and seducing her, she turns out to already be sexually active and makes the first move to seduce him (though this could be spin on the part of an unreliable narrator). One or two lucky breaks for the protagonist are acceptable, but several back to back started to make it feel like Nabokov was just eager to get to the creepiest parts of the book and was taking plot short cuts to get there. Then, at the point where the tension of the book should be the highest, the book turns into a travelogue, with long lists and short descriptions of all the places they visit and stay as they move around the country. It's like sitting through someone's vacation slideshow. Again, I think that, plucking out any given passage from the book, I'd have to admit that it's powerful writing. It was just as a whole that it fell apart for me. "
5,Dolly,967,966,"Having finished this book, I understand why people have such conflicting views on it. It is a twisted narrative, albeit beautifully written, that sucks you in. At the same time, it involves a very disturbing subject matter. I would disagree with criticism that at any point the reader is invited to really sympathise with the main character: he is in no way a protagonist. Never do you forget that he's a disgusting, selfish, cowardly, predator. But his story, or perhaps, his obsessive delusion, is consuming in it's inevitable implosion. Nabakov's skill as a writer is immense; at many points I wanted to stop reading, because Humbert is a horrifying creep. But the way Nabakov writes never validates Humbert, and the story is, despite its dark subject matter, fascinating. The denouement of the novel is especially tense and gripping. It's a vivid story about a dark, destructive, obsessive character.(Trigger warnings for child abuse, pedophilia, emotional abuse.)"
5,Reader,968,967,"I bought this book after I read some reviews on this website. It had so many 4-5*s I thought it was going to blow me away!It was horrible. One thing I hate: novels that are choc-filled with irrelevant bla-bla-bla-ing to fill up the book.The author is clearly very talented, and extremely intellectual which is constantly shown off with the use of 'big words' and references to things/people/events that you cant be sure are made up or not.There were some parts of this which made me laugh out loud. Once again, a very talented writer, but sadly by about two thirds in I was skipping pages. It was so utterly boring, confusing, and shallow. I felt no depth of the characters at all. Take out all the irrelevant rubbish and it might have been a 3* story. "
5,Vivi Vocat,970,969,"It is a great achievement to write from the perspective of the villain and still be able to capture and fascinate readers all over the world. You‘ll never like Humbert, but you still keep on reading. It is even more so a great feat, because the characters in the book remain two-dimensional.The language, full of word plays and wit, is so rich and beautiful that it made me reread certain passages several times. But even the use of very beautiful language and powerful images couldn’t mask the fact that this is a book about a pedophile, kidnapping and raping his victim several times. This is not a love story or a game; it’s a trip into the mind of child molester. Personally, I fail to understand, why so many try to attribute a deeper meaning to it. There is none, for the book is meant to unsettle and provoke the reader. It is meant to take you to a dark place and depict raw unchecked and primal desires of man’s nature, in which some might recognize your own base instincts masked by civility and morality, thus scaring you with the underlying truth: How society loves to blame the victim and how willingly and readily many will follow Humbert’s reasoning.I didn’t like this book, because it is so deviant and took me to places so dark, perverted and unfortunately true.

Not great. I seriously don't see what was so fabulous about it to be considered a classic. Disturbing content, and well, yeah. I didn't like it very much, but to each his own."
5,Sarah Hampton,982,981,"This book was a lot like my ex-boyfriend. Promised a lot up-front but turned out to be lack-lustre, seedy and pretentious."
5,Carly Movius,983,982,"I just finished this book, there were times I thought about outright putting this book down, shaking my head in disgust and starting a whole new book, fresh. Yet other times I was compelled to read and thought the book was written and set up beautifully. So as an unfolding events it was done beautifully, with beautiful language. However the premise and the ""love story"" was vile. The last chapter was the best, Humbert finally gets what he deserves, but the last 60 pages or so I just couldn't wait to get the book over with. Every time I read the words, ""nympet or pubescent"" after page 50 I nearly gagged! There are just some things that one shouldn't read I suppose."
5,Kristiina,985,984,"Read it a long time ago, didn't like it much. I don't understand Humbert Humbert. One time reading it was enough for me. It was part of the school literature curriculum."
5,Emusam,987,986,"Let me be clear: my rating isn't based on my disapproval of pedophilia. I really was just annoyed by Humbert and Lolita. I couldn't stand either of them. Humbert's narration almost never stopped annoying me. Perhaps I was tired of it because the narrator of Pale Fire's commentary section was done in a similar way (European transplant with inflated self-image and elevated speech) and it is still fresh in my mind. In any case, H.H. grated on my nerves. My favorite part of the book was when Dolores left Humbert. The end bit where he shoots Cue was also quite strange, and was probably my favorite section. Reading Nabokov's explanatory section after the end was very interesting--that it was perhaps something like a love letter to the English language, which he had embraced after being forced by circumstance to leave publishing in Russian. "

5,Tania,989,988,"I couldn't get past the sexually explicit wording. I have no problem reading sexual books, but this one just rubbed me the wrong way (no pun intended). I couldn't wrap my head around the relationship between an adult and a young girl. Couldn't bring myself to even finish half of the book."
5,Grillo,990,989,"The prose itself is beautiful and pretty much unmatched, but as a whole...it's not for me. I found the actual story something of a trudge, and thought that in terms of plot, it pretty much unraveled during the second half. In addition, I found the single-minded fixation of H.H. numbing, and his personality absolutely abhorrent, which I think is the point, but it makes for unsatisfying reading. It might be okay if there was something new and vital being imparted as the novel progressed, some interesting continued psychological development, but after the first fifty pages, you really know all you need to know."
5,Bruce Henderson,993,992,"This was not a very enjoyable book. I decided to read more works considered ""fine literature"" and this book would lead to another. However, with Lolita, you spend the vast majority of the time (on the order of about 95 percent or so) in Humbert Humbert's head where he takes you on his trip to dementia. I'm impressed that Nabokov was able to do that, but it was not a fun trip.In addition, the author consistently made HH use French words, clauses, phrases and even entire paragraphs to illustrate how he considered himself an intellectual in the face of his obsession. As Dolores (HH's Lolita) put it, ""But do you mind very much cutting out the French? It annoys everybody."" Indeed it does.So much for HH's propensity to annoy. Nabokov manages to annoy me as well. I appreciate learning new words from books as much as the next person, but never have I read a book with so many new words. My vocabulary is not particularly small, but I usually go through a novel and glean perhaps 5 or 6 new words. Nabokov's Lolita gave me over 60: backfisch, derlickwent, lentor, antemeridian, pharisaic, Laodicean, trochaic, lanugo, anent (twice), pavonine, oculate, leporine, fain, purly (and purling), viatic, buncombe, inly, poltroon, favonian, nates, incarnadine, acrosonic, alembic (and alembics), tombal, crepitated, apotheosis, coeval, uranist, manque (accent over the ""e""), fascinum, girleen, voluptas, grues, jocosely, phocine, dolors, charshaf, seraglio, saporous, duenna, philter (several times), olisbos, lentigo, cretonne, orchideous, tesselated, caloricity, venus febriculosa, kurort (kurortish), remises, wimble, syncope, execrabic, ancilla, undinist, gitanilla, fatamorganas, turpid, penele, selenian, logomancy, logodaedaly, ensellure, and undoubtedly more. I don't need this many new words in what is a relatively short book. In context, it is surprisingly easy to imagine other words that could have been used but for some reason, it was decided to wow the audience. I fail to appreciate it."

5,Efrén Ayón,1001,1000,"The for many years considered as quintessential experience for readers all across the world could not match its potential.And how could it? It's as whimsical and lyrcal as it is boring and excesive. Nabokov's prose it's relentless, beautiful, classical and, why not, more european than american. But there is nothing else here, just talent. This novel contains a handful of passages that'll charm their way to the deepest of what some call soul, but otherwise it's a book about the ramble on of a man desesperate to make you notice him by the gift he has born with.And there it is, an unpopular opinion of the great not-so-american novel."
5,Zuneera Shah,1002,1001,"This book had been on my list for about a year now, somewhere around the time where I developed a great liking for classics.However, i will not shy away from coming clean about my ignorance as to what this book was about. I usually prefer it that way-to let a book take me by surprise. And this is exactly what Lolita did.May i also mention here that I had no idea what the word Lolita meant, by and by.Well, it doesn't take you long before you realize what the storyline is. I haven't really discussed it with many people since it's a recent read but I hope to God I don't find any supporters for the narrator.It's grasping, I'll give it that. No matter how disgusted your insides feel, you have an inclination to read on.A literary genius, no doubt, but it did not appeal to me. The two-stars i gave this book is for the beautiful manipulation of writing; which is the only thing that pacifies the grotesque nature of the story.On a note of honesty, this book scared me. "
5,Candice,1009,1008,"Lolita was on my to read list for years, so I made it my pool bag book a couple of summers ago. Thought it'd be a page-turner, but I didn't really enjoy it. There were some undeniably compelling passages, but I couldn't get past the icky and the end was just depressing."
5,Cooweescoowee,1011,1010,"A hard book to read though it is well written. You read on & on fearing it will get worse than it is. It doesn't, you are left reading of a very sick/twisted man. "

5,Nichole,1020,1019,"I couldn't finish this book. As a mother to two little girls, I found the story-telling from the point of view of the pedophile to be nauseating. I read previous reviews that suggest that you will sympathize with the narrator. Impossible. Men like this exist in the world. They don't need to be glamorized. Yuck. "
5,Portia S,1021,1020,"Suffice to say, I did not enjoy this book. One thing I have to agree always with Murakami is when he said in Norwegian Wood, *If you read what everyone else is reading, you're going to think like everyone else* Paraphrasing, but yes. I read this because it's on a BBC list of ""100 Must Read"", etc etc, and none of these included any works by Somerset Maugham I MUST add.The saving grace of this books was it's prose, so beautifully written, however, like the lauded Wilde, this writer would go off on a tangent that added nothing to the plot or excited my interest. Writing is like taking a walk, Dahl once said, you start with leaving the house, going up towards the hill top, sometimes you take the part well traveled and other times the rougher road. *Pardon the dialect* This man take all kinda back road and short street and had me there waiting waiting waiting, and I was just there, like what this hadda do with anything? The best parts of this book was the beginning and the end. Though I didn't like it terribly, it's saving grace had to have been the end, that was pretty good, quite intense and I really was like a thirsty man being dosed with cold water then. So yeah, those are my thoughts. "

5,Kilulinna Keit,1025,1024,"Ausalt öelda ma ei suudagi otsustada, mis või kes selles raamatus mulle kõige ebasümpaatsem on -kas selgrootu pedofiil Humbert või tüdruku juhm-pime ema. Või siis hoopis Nabokov ise, kes mõnuga ja ilutsedes kirjeldab lugu alaealise seksuaalsest ärakasutamisest ja üritab süüd tolle kaela veeretada, kujutades Lolitat manipuleeriva ja pinnapealsena. Kuid süüdistada last manipuleerimises on sama, kui süüdistada kassipoega mänguhimulisuses. Täiskasvanu, suurema intelligentsiga isik, on ikka see, kes määrab, kust lähevad piirid. Nabokov nihutab aga piire selle järgi, mis teda parasjagu erutab, üritab üsna selget juhtumit muuta ähmasemaks.Niisiis, need 2 * tulid puhtalt jutustuse ladususe eest ja ei millegi muu."
5,Marcy,1026,1025,I started this but never finished it. Really wanted to read it. Kind of slow...which is why I didn't finish it. Plan to pick it up again. Interesting story line.
5,Moody,1027,1026,"At the end of my copy of Lolita, Nabakov refers to the novel as the record of his love affair with the English language. He goes on to address a variety of criticisms, among them that the work doesn’t teach one anything. He explains that he is not a writer of didactic fiction and reveals his purpose for starting a book is to get rid of that book, and to achieve a kind of aesthetic bliss. That's fair enough.Awake one night on a friend's couch, I picked up Lolita to read myself to sleep. I flipped to the center, read a few spicy pages, and dozed off. The book came home with me, and I approached it with an open mind, all preconceptions aside. (Who would have believed I would discover my first literary reference to the iliac crests? Thanks Nabakov...though a little unsettling.)This story is Humbert's Confession, and in that way, Nabakov excuses the descriptive flourishes and singular focus of his protagonist. I signed on for the first forty pages, his background and meeting Lolita, but suffered the next two hundred with much less enthusiasm. For the bulk of the latter, I was nauseated and bored.Nothing about Humbert's telling feels contrived, and the writing retains its authenticity throughout. That demonstration of craft, together with the particularly sharp writing of the final eight chapters (some fantastic bits), made Lolita worth the read; however, I don't feel it provided any important perspective for me to consider, and I wouldn't ever reread it.However I cannot deny the novel’s impact – for weeks afterwards, Humbert’s sad, trick logic would pollute my thoughts. And I delighted in the tennis passage, along with his treat scatological conquests. But throughout it all, I kept thinking, “When is he going to set the page on fire?” He never did.On the back cover of my copy, it reads, ""The only convincing love story of our century."" (Vanity Fair). This is a testament, I suspect, to Nabakov's skill in channeling Humbert's ugly, lunatic voice. And I get why it’s good. Furthermore, I take interest and admire when an author successfully inhabits the mind of his character. But, I liken the experience to watching an exquisite performance in a bad film. Just because I appreciate the art of the craft doesn’t mean the story resonates. I didn't abandon the thing, but I'm glad it's over.(A Reluctant Note: A few years ago my job required a careful reading of certain police reports, including the statements and elocutions from criminals detailing every aspect of their offenses. This experience drained all the blood from the story of Lotlita, for me.)"
5,Adam Rodgers,1028,1027,"This was painful to read, although I finished it to the end, hoping to see something I was missing. I may not be intelligent enough to get out of this what others see as a masterpiece, but to me most of it was repulsive. Just not my kind of book. In most books with criminals as the main character at least the books manage to help me sympathize somewhat with the criminal, like in Stephen King's Secret Window, Secret Garden. But in this book any chance of my sympathy or even interest was lost right at the beginning, and it was hard to get past that. I just kept hoping he would get caught as soon as possible. In other words the book is written in a very descriptive way with beautiful, poetic words, but not enough to make me appreciate them because of what he was constantly describing and lusting after. "
5,Mogbolahan Koya-Oyagbola,1033,1032,"Undoubtedly a well written book but the disturbing subject matter kept interfering with me moving forward. I've never watched a snuff movie and I don't know that I ever would even if one such movie were gaining rave reviews as a cinematic masterpiece. While written fiction (however disturbing the subject matter) can never be placed in the same category as snuff movies, it can be equally disturbing on the psyche.For the reasons above I'm not sure I'll ever be able to read this book from start to finish."
5,Veronica Widya,1040,1039,"the most boring book that i ever read!this book is tell about a lecture who falling in love with the girl. yeah, you are right. he is phedophile, and there are many things that hide by the words.If u think its vulgar, u re wrong. its unspoken forbidden love that veiled by the writer."

5,Tamara,1043,1042,"This book had its merits, but it was a slog for me. I did enjoy some of Nabokov's prose and the development of Humbert's sinister and manipulative character, but, at the end of the day, it was just an overly verbose creepshow."
5,Song Yee,1047,1046,I was drawn by the title :P
5,Hetal,1048,1047,"It was as two stars indicate-'ok'. The slow descent into madness was well portrayed, perhaps a bit too well, because it left the content oftentimes dry and confusing. There were some parts to this book I was excited and couldn't put it down, and then others where it was a drag to pick it up. I slogged through it, it took forever, but I am glad it's done, it was worth the read, in hindsight."
5,Joseph,1049,1048,"I admittedly went into reading this book with high expectations. It is a classic and is erotic, which is a departure from my familiar finance reading. Despite the novelty of the story, it did not deliver. For better or worse, my generation regularly has more intimate conversations and there is more intrigue in the checkout isle of the A&P. The book had it's time, but that time is past."
5,Rebecca Tarry,1051,1050,Although beautifully written I could not finish this book as I found the theme far too disturbing 
5,Miri,1052,1051,"I almost don't want to try and sort out exactly how I feel about this book, because I don't want to give it that degree of attention now that I've finished. If the book is hard for me to process, the reviews of it are maybe even worse. Yes, of course, the prose is elegant. Yes, the perspective is unique and sickeningly... well, interesting, for lack of a better word. No, I do not understand why people call it a love story. I am truly baffled by how many times I've seen the word ""tender"" used to describe it. I think I'd give it one star for my opinion of it, so I'll give it an extra star for the skill in writing.Have I ever read a character as self-indulgent and self-pitying as Humbert Humbert? Poor Humbert, poor meek, abject, massive, pathetic, desperate clawed Humbert, simultaneously a monster and a hero in his own mind, turned on by the ankles and skin and ""stippled armpit"" of a twelve-year-old girl who picks her nose while he makes her sit on his naked erection. He fantasizes about having sex with his own future daughter and granddaughter, congratulating himself on how ""tender"" he is, how great a ""father,"" how miserable and courageous. He craves Lolita, but that is not the same as love. He hurts her, physically and emotionally, routinely and deliberately. That is not tenderness. It's abuse.He may even actually love her—how would I know?—but that does not make this story a story about love. It is the story of an intensely troubled adult man who rapes his twelve-year-old stepdaughter, taking her hostage around the entire country, lying in bed listening to her cry as soon as he feigns sleep every night for two years. It's the story of obsession and total self-absorption. Frankly, looking at the real-world reception of the book, I think it's the story of everything and everyone that is casually sacrificed to the ""art"" of the ""White Widowed Male."" Because as it says in the pseudonymous foreword of the book, actually just part of the book, written by Nabokov as John Ray, Jr.:""The learned may . . . [assert] that 'H.H.'s impassioned confession is a tempest in a test tube; that at least 12 percent of American males—a 'conservative' estimate according to Dr. Blanche Schwarzman (verbal communication)—enjoy yearly, in one way or another, the special experience 'H.H.' describes with such despair; that had our demented diarist gone, in the fatal summer of 1947, to a competent psychopathologist, there would have been no disaster; but then, neither would there have been this book."" Equal tragedies, apparently. Because what's the life of a girl compared to Art?"
5,Lisa Mills,1053,1052,Humbert Humbert needed to keep his inappropriate relationship with Lolita secret but he soon became supremely obsessive and controlling over her. He ranted on and on and his dialogue became confusing to me. I guess his madness was so complete that I couldn’t keep up and I feel like I missed out on a lot of what really happened.
5,Samuel,1054,1053,Sorry Vlad.
5,Laraine,1055,1054,"NOTE: I read this book for a book club discussion; I opted out of the actual discussion as did several other members.This was my second read of this novel--the first being a few decades ago. I recall the movie starring James Mason but it's the haunting music I remember more than the actual script or acting--perhaps its because of the movie's theme.I heard this book was originally intended to be a comedy, which I find hard to believe. I can't even say it's really the love story it's advertised to be, except I am sure for Humbert Humbert, truly ""madly"" in love with his Lolita (actual name-Dolores). The writing is flowery, descriptive, even clever in many ways. I was unable to finish the entire book but may go back and skim to the end just to reach closure. Yet I read as much as I could, wanting to see if at this point in my life I would be able to push past the theme and just focus on the quality of the writing."
5,Sohvi,1057,1056,"While certainly disturbing in many ways, this is not a bad book. The way it is written is quite poetical, if a bit slow. There are long bits that do not seem to make any progress to the story.However, I did not see why people consider this to be such a great book. As I said, the language is beautiful, but I feel like most people appreciate for the shock value.What I find most disturbing, is how people speak about it. They say this is a book about seductive little vixen who controls man's life. Or - what is even more horrible - they call this ""convincing love story"" (a praise by Vanity Fair, printed on the back of the 50th anniversary edition.) Sure the book is meant to be like memoirs, written by Humbert Humbert himself. But personally I still didn't feel any need to side with him. He is an unreliable narrator, who wishes people to believe him. He needs their pity and understanding, because he too can in some way see that what he does is horribly wrong. And he too says multiple times, that Lolita has no one else to go to. She has no one else, but him.I think it is worrisome how many people actually interpret this book in a way, that Lolita is at least partly responsible, because she seeks attention and affection from Humbert Humbert. That says some really sad things about how little girls are over-sexualized not only inside the pages of this book, but also in reality. The book itself is interesting and even though it was not my favourite, it was okay. I would recommend reading this, if only to better understand discussions and misinterpretations that are rampant in our society. "
5,Anya Aksarova,1059,1058,"Честно говоря, я ожидала большего в связи с шумом которым это произведение подняло в свои годы. Но я для себя давно поставила четкое правило: всё что человечество признало классикой - должно бесприкословно быть прочитаным мной. ""Лолита"" поразила меня действительно оригинальными словооборотами, ярко выраженными образами и просто интересным и запоминающимся языком. Что мне не понравилось: нелогичный сюжет. Постоянно навязываемый читателю образ Гумберта. Неуравновешенный, лихорадочно-зацикленный на своей нимфетке невротик. К 300ой странице мне просто было уже скучно в тысячный раз читать о его сублимированных фантазиях и пристрастиях. Мне лично книга не сильно импонировала видимо из-за моей некомпетентности в сферах зацикленности и яростного обожания одного предмета."
5,Bryce,1061,1060,I think Nabokov's overrated.
5,Roshunda,1063,1062,The disturbing mind of a pedophile...
5,Chelsey Quack,1064,1063,"TL;DR: NABOKOV DID PRETTY GOOD & I LOATHE OUR NARRATOR. My rating of this book may change once my emotions aren't controlling my thoughts as a reader so much.First and foremost, if you're going to be reading my review (well, more of a rant), be aware that I've had a hard time controlling my feelings regarding the narrator. This is largely my frustrated ramblings regarding issues of sexual abuse. But I think it is impossible to read a book of this nature without discussing these issues. I had to rant about it somewhere. But my guess is that if you've made it through this book, or are considering reading it, my thoughts will be the least of your troubles when it comes to trigger warnings.I don't know how to feel about this novel; its content, needless to say, was so hugely uncomfortable for me. This is one of the few times I have needed to keep a cheerful, lighthearted, harmless book nearby, so that when this one became too upsetting for me, I had something to cheer me up directly available. Normally, I have a very positive reaction to novels that make me FEEL so much. But I have very firm thoughts and feelings regarding victim blaming and sexual abuse, which made it very difficult for me to set aside my emotions. My reading experience was totally plagued by a hatred for our revolting narrator. The fact that his ""total adoration"" and ""love"" for Dolores (because, honestly, I have such an issue with referring to her as ""Lolita,"" the name only her abuser called her - this brings up issues of sexual abuse victims being defined by their abuse which I can't really get into here) brings any sort of sympathy out in a reader upsets me. No child is responsible for being abused by an adult. On this note, I will definitely commend Nabokov for bringing to light issues of rapist privilege and victim blaming. Our unreliable narrator manipulates the reader the same way a crying rapist in a courtroom manipulates the jury. Dolores consented as much as a too-drunk person consents. What she wore or how she behaved is not the point, whether she flirted or made the first move is not the point. The point is that the abuser CHOOSES to abuse someone else and this is an issue that continues to, for some reason, be unclear to all abusers and rapist sympathizers. So, what I mean to say by saying all of this, is Nabokov has very effectively brought to light a long term cultural issue regarding sex and consent, and he has gotten into the mind of his narrator amazingly. But, even with his feelings of remorse, and his initial hopes of leaving Dolores ""untainted"" (yeah, because drugging a person to rape them is better than raping them when they're awake), Humbert has absolutely no sympathy from me.Furthermore, Humbert's idea of being ""in love"" with ANYONE the way he treats Dolly is still unforgiveable. Say Dolly had been a fully grown woman - this is still a novel about a guy who is obsessed with controlling his sexual interest, who will not let his ""partner"" talk to other men, go out on her own, etc. Who flies into a jealous rage and literally tears her clothes off when he imagines another man has come onto her. Even if their ages were the same, Humbert is controlling and delusional. Anyways, HERE'S WHAT I THINK ABOUT OUR AUTHOR AND THE WRITING:The writing itself was not quite to my taste. There were some clever word plays and beautiful passages, but sometimes it was a little too flowery for me. Again, pretty amazed at how Nabokov got into our narrator's head. Characterisation was brilliant in its horrifying nature. "
5,Noortje van der Veen,1066,1065,"I liked the first half of the book, even though it's very very disturbing. But after 150 pages I got a bit bored and I really wasn't looking forward to reading it anymore. Though I really did like the story line and the characters. "

5,MaiAda,1087,1086,"i confess, i couldn't make it all the way through.people call this ""erotic"", or ""dark humor"". however, all i see is a brilliantly written portrayal of a sociopath. halfway through i decided i got the point, and didn't want to spend anymore time reading about the kidnapping and repeated rape of a teenage girl. one star for writing. one star for the ability to convincingly get into the mind of a sociopathic pedophile. too convincingly for me to stomach."
5,Justin,1089,1088,"Books are made to provoke, ignite deep thought, and entertain all at the same time. At least, that is what it seems Nabokov sought out when he wrote this highly controversial book. Struggling to read the book through the lens of the 1950s, when relationships between children and adults were likely less vilified (although still quite considering the reaction from various countries and publishing houses) than today where men such as the Humbert Humbert would be listed as nothing more than a sick, soulless child rapist, I was able to greatly appreciate the prose surrounding Nabokov's impressions of Americana, with his observations surrounding tourist traps that highlighted the pre-Interstate highways luring drivers to towns large and small. I wish I could say this was a fantastic novel that everyone should read, but I'm left saying the controversy surrounding the novel has diminished it's potential greatness, which is sad. Had the child been older (and legal), the book would've exceeded expectations. As such, I am left wondering how it was ever published in this state."
5,Penny Bradley,1092,1091,"After taking a break midway through, I finally finished this very tedious and one note book. "
5,Kimberlyn,1093,1092,"In reviews, critics say that Nabokov creates an empathy for his protagonist. NO. NOT FOR ONE SENTENCE. I do not consider myself to be naive or an unsophisticated reader; however, despite the brilliance of Nabokov's writing style, the analysis of the master/slave dynamic at the bottom of all evil social structures, the thematic use of exile, the touch of the 19th c ""doubling,"" and the address of sexual deviancy, I just felt sick inside as I read it.  Perhaps it is the recent trial of the man who molested my friend's six year old daughter that made this all too real to me. From the moment HH climaxed because Lo sat on his lap, the book was lost to me. There was no redeeming quality in the protagonist, and all I wanted was for someone to blow HH's head clean off of his shoulders. Sadly, this never happened, and as his monologue continued to try to gain empathy from the reader, the more and more I grew ill. Perhaps the book is actually a classic in that way. It depicts the real undeniable sickness within men who break children (and women of any age) and see them merely as objects meant only to satisfy their desires; and this book brutalizes those children (and women) who will do anything in order to survive. A few years ago, an NPR correspondent (a man who lists being a skateboarder before being professor of creative writing at Harvard) warned that ""prospective readers not retreat to any kind of moral high ground."" Sorry, dude, raping children is a flood of evil too deep for my tastes. I'm heading to higher ground. FYI: Dominique Swain was 15 when she filmed Lolita in 1997. Sue Lyon was 14 when she played Lolita in 1962. Neither of them were the 9-year-olds whom HH watches on the playground. Nor were they the 12-year-old Lolita he forces to service him. There is nothing sexy in a child. NOTHING. "
5,Kasia,1094,1093,"I wanted to like this book SO bad. I was really prepared to get really into it, but I just couldn't. I'm pretty sure I was supposed to find Humbert Humbert to be a surprisingly sympathetic character. I felt like I was supposed to like him against the odds. But I just didn't. I found his perversion and sexual abuse to be completely appalling and extremely tiring. I also found his character to be strangely flat, and even flatter, the character of Lolita. I suppose I'm glad I read it, but I'm definitely happy it's over. All in all, disappointing."

Part One was very much a car-crash read. I hated it, but couldn't look away.Then Part Two started, and I was over it.The thing is, I was a lot like Lo when I was her age. Thankfully there was no Humbert Humbert in my life taking advantage of that, but, man, talk about hitting too close to home. I didn't want to read through the pages of H.H. flipping out over Lola hanging out with boys. I've lived that, with exes, and I've no desire to re-live it or read about it!

I will try to re-read the book while I'm lying on the beach in San Diego... just to be fair)"

Además que este libro trata de un tema tan polémico que aunque personalmente no me escandalizo sí hubo momentos en los cuales me hizo sentir incómoda y un poco molesta. A pesar de todo me encantó la forma de escribir de Vladimir Nabokov, una forma de escribir tan poética y hermosa. Definitivamente no es un clásico que le gustará a todo el mundo y ese fue mi caso. Pero como cada quién tiene diferentes gusto y preferencias los ánimo a darle una oportunidad."
5,Isa,1120,1119,"I think that this book was MAJORLY over hyped in my perspective (or maybe it's just because it's from the perspective of a 15-year-old). I've had this problem where I read classics but don't understand them, partially because of my age, and partly because I don't have a mature enough mindset.Now, Lolita wasn't all that great in my opinion. To me, Lo was a huge snobbish brat, and I think she got it from her mother, who was also a huge snobbish brat. Humbert Humbert was the perfect blend of eloquent and creepy, but his advanced way with words had me confused during some major plot points. I feel as if the French in this novel was a nice touch, but vastly overused. I don't speak french, so I often found myself reaching for my laptop to Google translate what he was saying. This novel (though exceedingly boring in some parts) did have a way of making me squirm in some spots. I wasn't sure whether to sympathize with the despairing Humbert, or to be disgusted with the actions of a middle-aged man. By the end I decided that it was both. I felt a weird pang of sympathy towards the end when he was writing his final goodbyes to Lolita. Though earlier I'd been scowling in disgust and scratching my head in confusion at his words, I found myself deeply saddened by the end paragraph. Because while what he did was NEVER EXCUSABLE IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE, he really was a man in love. I give this book two stars. It would be one, because I really couldn't wait for it to be over, but it made me feel something at the end, so I gave it an extra. Maybe I'll get it when I'm older. "

5,Jaimie,1124,1123,"I finished this last night and I have to admit that I am disappointed.I've been looking forward to reading this book for a while now. It started off great, getting to know Humbert Humbert. The whole story is fascinating and Lolita was such an interesting character, as well as Humbert, but after those introductions and a certain death, I thought it turned out boring. The writing is nice. I would kill to write like that, but it was all detail and it happens to be quite bland. I didn't find what was going on interesting enough.I love the story of Lolita, the characters and Nabokov's writing, but those are probably the only things I did like about it. I wasn't sure whether to give this a two star of three star rating, but I'm giving it a two. One star would be too harsh. "
5,Leonart Maruli,1127,1126,"Tulisannya tembak sana tembak sini... Ga tau tulisan Nabokov yang lain bagus atau tidak, ingin baca Pale Fire supaya lebih obyektif. Dengar-dengar tulisan Nabokov dalam Pale Fire itu sangat tidak biasa, narasi novel berbentuk puisi.Untuk novel Lolita ini deskripsi psikologisnya : okelah tapi alurnya yang tidak teratur bikin orang yang tidak suka cara berpikir tidak terstruktur akan kelelahan... (gue skimming aja bagian yang tidak perlu).For this novel, I think Nabokov's status as one of the greatest writer of the 20th century is ridicolous."

5,Andalee,1130,1129,Didn't finish it cuz it repulsed me. But it is written very well. 
5,Garren,1133,1132,"I'll never understand why this is more popular than Pale Fire (for literary excellence) or Ada, or Ardor (for subversive sexuality)."
5,Asma,1134,1133,"Humbert Humbert came from a seemingly normal environment: he's well educated, and is quite a word master. Except...that he is insane, and is attracted to little girls. After immigrating to America, Humbert lives with a single mother, and her daughter, Lolita, becomes the fixture of his days...This is perhaps the most easiest synopsis I've written, because nothing really happens throughout the book. At the same time, writing this review is a little difficult. I had mixed feelings about this. There's no denying that this book started with beautiful writing. Humbert's words were captivating, expressive, descriptive- I like that in a book. But once he enters pedo-perversion, it's just... I can't help being bias and hating him. Another thing, this book would be awesome for book discussions and classes-- character study, for example. I couldn't help but wonder if Humbert really did tell truths, or lies, or were distortions. Especially since by the end, the book is incoherent with his thoughts. I'd love to have discussed this with someone, just to have ideas bounced back and forth. But reading this for pleasure? Let's just say I need a dose of fluff and Disney and rainbows and really, really happy memories right now."
5,Lyndsey Reed,1135,1134,"Dear Nabokov,I get it. You know how to create plays on words. You're SUPER entertained by your ability to do so. Can you just tell the damn story now? This book was so, so eyeroll inducing for me. Was totally relieved when I finally finished it. "
5,JC,1136,1135,"Ugh, I couldn't get into this book for the first 100 pages or so. The book was just way too slow to start. Like I typically say, I'd prefer a book that start faster as it will at least grab my attention. I'm sure it had to do with a combination of the translation and Russian books in general (they are usual quite different in terms of style). Also, I was expecting this book to be a bit questionable, but it was pretty clean (guess it was just bad 50+ years ago)."
5,Sindy Li,1145,1144,"Someone at a book club said it's his least favorite book because ""it was just about this guy and this girl"", so I decided to see how bad it is. I mostly agree. It was fairly boring until about half way through (which was when I gave up) and the writing wasn't too attractive (though some word plays were cool), even though the events it described were very weird so I read on out of curiosity until I couldn't stand it any more. I jumped to the end and the last few chapters were interesting. But I still don't get how it is deemed to be one of the greatest novels of last century, something like that.It's a story of a sad and sick guy doing something terrible to a girl who wasn't so normal or healthy to begin with, and it damaged both of them. I guess it's an example of obsession that under the disguise of love (which may have turned into love in the end), or at least a very possessive and objectifying kind of love. By describing his ""enemies"" as repulsive (e.g. Charlotte), Humpert managed to make me the reader sympathetic towards him for a while, but when I read that he wanted to reproduce a Lolita the Second and then a Lolita the Third with Lolita, I felt really sick. In the end he realized that he was in love with Lolita herself, not nearly the nymphet, which was a bit touching, but who knows if that's true love or the continuation of obsession."
5,Crystal,1147,1146,"Wow. I didn't really care for this book, but it was an okay read. More shocking than anything."
5,Cynthia Nine,1150,1149,"This book has everything I admire in a novel: a beautiful use of the language, wit, the most cunning narrator ever seen and an enigmatic object of adoration. However, having worked as a volunteer with children who suffered abuse in a developing country, I became so sensitive to this subject that I found it excruciatingly painful to get through the pages of Lolita. Reading this was pure agony. I think I only made it to the end because I wanted to see if someone would scalp the rapist Humbert Humbert, cover his open wounds with honey, bury him in an anthill and them force him to fly over the Bermuda Triangle, but none of my dreams came true, so I wasted my sweat on this for nothing.Someone should write a novel from Lolita's perspective. One in which Charlotte doesn't die, the kid goes all ""hard candy"" on Humbert and both girls end up having all sorts of fun torturing him. That would be awesome."
5,Pauline,1151,1150,"very well written. nabokov stretches and uses nice techniques. however the book was too long and dragged on too much for my tastes. it's interesting how he was able to describe the relationship between him and dolores without vulgarity. i wasn't repulsed by the content because it wasn't explicit but at the same time, it was creepy. it's sad about the damage he did to lo's life and even though he said he ""loved"" her, i don't think he did. the play with words was great but at the same time annoying because i would have to look up the french phrases or look up a definition in the dictionary. maybe reading books like this will help expand my vocabulary."

5,Adrienne,1157,1156,"I couldn't finish this book, either I lost focus of the book did, most likely me though. The beginning was good!"
5,Heidi Willis,1166,1165,"I read this because it seemed like a book I should read - a subject alluded to all the time in our culture. Even though I knew what the subject was - a man who loves young girls - I wasn't prepared for how unpalatable the story was. The narrator was not one I could find an iota of sympathy for, and the object of his attraction was nearly equally unsympathetic. Neither character significantly changed over the course of the book, and my lack of connection to them made it easy to want to skim long, overwrought narrative passages that seemed to go nowhere."
5,Terri,1167,1166,"I LOVE Nabokov's short stories, but I HATED Lolita. Pervy and just could NOT get through it."
5,Belinda,1171,1170,It was read to me by a very strong accent....I felt dirty listening to it. I guess it was like watching a trainwreck.
5,Matthew Allison,1183,1182,"It failed to roar, Oscar Wilde might say. He's dead, therefore I will have said it. Read for the inside jokes (no I'm not being witty), and read for the allusively complex insinuations and tones. The story is better for having been written. Let the wheel roll off the cliff."
5,Ubiquitousbastard,1185,1184,"Quite icky, and at no point does Dolly, (Lolita) wear a huge, slutty Victorian dress, so I really got confused about Gothic Lolitas. I think this was supposed to be ironic, but it really just ended up being dull and creepy. There were a few good parts, mostly when the weird crap was happening, but I struggled through the majority of the book.The unreliable narrator was kind of a cool idea, but I don't think enough was done with it to make it appeal to me."
5,Chie,1188,1187,"The realism is shocking.It had me feeling sick in the pit of my stomach. I simply couldn't finish it. I didnt enjoy his writing style, it was overdone, i felt it didnt flow, the words where just so dense. Teddy Bundy is interesting, this is disturbing.One day when im past the perverse approach, ill try to finish this."
5,maybedeathisagift,1189,1188,"When I understood what was happening, I liked the storyline, but half the time I had NO idea what was going on. The whole ending was lost on me. Who the fuck is Clare Quilty? Lame."

5,Livvio,1192,1191,"(2,5*)"
5,Melinda Clark,1193,1192,"I get that it's a classic and all, but it's still really difficult to read a whole book about an old man describing his lust for this young girl. It's hard to pay attention to how well-written the book is when you're so disgusted. I had a hard time making it through this one."
5,Aaron Meyer,1195,1194,"Took me forever to wade through this book. I honestly could not get in to a story about some guy who loves little girls and who spends years doing the things he did to Dolly Haze. The only part of the book that I enjoyed was the fight with Cue and his imprisonment, and the ending that only my mind could furnish, his punishment. Not a book I would read again and not totally sure how this is considered a classic to be honest."
5,Macy,1196,1195,The subject matter was questionable and a little difficult to really get into. The way it was written was beautiful though. 
5,Yoanna,1199,1198,"It's still very hard for me to make up my mind about this book. It took me a long time, some persuasion and a really bad book read just before part 2, to get to the point of actually liking it. It's undeniable that there is a lot of poetry and skill in this book but... at the end of the day, I will not be re-reading it. "
5,Preludes,1201,1200,"It has to be said that I didn’t much enjoy Lolita.This is a great shame, since it came so highly recommended. Of course I was happy that I made the effort, though: a classic is a classic, and it always benefits you in some way to read it. Besides, there’s nothing quite so sad as the discarded corpse of a half read book, so I struggled to the end.Vladimir Nabokov the man, as I saw from reading the end commentary that he wrote which was present in my Lolita edition, is a guy that I immediately liked. Funny, passionate and approachable, after reading the notes in the back of the book I felt happy and proud to have read Lolita to the end, as if doing a good friend a favour.Things that I did like in the book was the black humour, the floral description and how paedophilia was handled. It showed the tenderness of Humbert’s adoration of his ‘nymphets’, mixed with the predatory selfishness and filth of it. Lolita herself was no saint either, and the mix of selfishness, innocence, and crudeness of pubescence was perfectly written. You both liked and hated Humbert, and liked and hated Lolita, and felt sorry for them both.Humbert’s occasional poems in the book were a mix of genius and a deliberate naffness that was written to be funny and mocking at the character’s expense, and yet they were both still touching. [You can read one here]Lolita’s eventual mundane fate was utterly real and heartbreakingly bland, which was a grim but poignant commentary on the nature of life itself. The universe doesn’t end with a bang, but a whimper as T.S.Eliot says. Similarily the murder at the end was a confused, blackly comics mess, and also fitting of the shambles that Humbert had become.The book itself, for all of these reasons, has unique and genuinely good elements, hence it’s status as a classic. But it simply didn’t engage me or grab me, and I was often left confused within the story, in part, I am sure, simply because of my drifting boredom.Lolita is not a bad book by any means, but for me it lacks that special something, and therefore I was left bored and unsatisfied."
5,Emily  Sears Cook,1203,1202,"I read this when I was in high school. I would give it a second chance, but I would rather read other works by Nabokov. I understand that he is a beautiful writer, but the content is too much for me. I know I should be ashamed of that statement, but I'm not. I thought the novel was creepy. "
5,Dorre,1204,1203,Boring
5,dian_yachan,1206,1205,meskipun best-seller di mana-mana tapi kata-kata yang digunakan dalam novel ini agak susah dimengerti
5,Donna,1207,1206,"I thought this book would be much better. I could not sympathize with the narrator, and the only reason I read through to the end was to find out how he ended up in jail. I was disappointed to say the least. It wasn't horrible, but I wouldn't recommend it."
5,Yasmin Rebelle,1208,1207,"The unique style of the writer is what stands out the most however for me a great novel is more than about how it's written. It is about what it conveys. Considering Nabókov did an extensive research for this novel, I would have expected to hear in some form the voice of the survivor of the violence, that of Lolita. Far from being thought provoking, I wouldn't list this book as a must read.**SPOILER ALERT**“Lolita” is a novel about and narrated by Humbert Humbert, an adult male who prides himself on finding prepubescent girls sexually attractive while also blaming them for it. It is unclear how many girls if any he abuses before he meets a 12 year old Lolita but when he does, he skillfully grooms and sexually abuses her. I found the first part of the novel hard to read as it portrays quiet believably the self-justifying and entitled mind of an abuser in his salacious thoughts. The second part reads more like fiction meets reality, while the ending like a fairy tale albeit a horror fairy tale. The strand of realism throughout the novel is that, just like most abusers, the anti-hero seeks power and control over Lolita while using various methods such as isolation, blaming and threats among others. He sees girls and women as mere sexual objects either to ridicule or lust after. Many literary critics, including Nabókov himself talk about a love story. But how can one love someone he objectifies, uses, abuses and never really gets to know? I believe that as a society we need to stop perpetuating rape culture by sensationalizing and/or being fascinated by abusers as well as eroticizing “prepubescent girls”. "
5,Harriet,1209,1208,Just okay...
5,Rasjel,1211,1210,"I found the reading experience slow going, mainly because of the pretentious, bombastic language (which seems a narrative choice, but is mainly annoying to read and makes it hard to keep interest). The upside is the controversial topic, which is at times shocking and thus interesting, but which, as the melodramatic prose continues, one gets ‘used’ to by the way of repetition. I do understand why it is important in the matter of topic, but the text itself did not draw my attention. So, I’d only recommend this novel to people specifically interested in the topic. "
5,Mish,1212,1211,"I was pre warned by friends before placing this on my to read list. They said it is distressing and to keep an open mind. I got more than I bargained for. I actually thought I knew what I was in for and had a vague idea of the relationship between Humbert and Lolita. Firstly I didn’t know Lolita’s age (for some reason I thought she was older). Secondly I wasn’t prepared for the intensity of his obsession with her, and the vivid description of how he sees these extremely young girls. From the look and feel of their skin, their characteristics, their beauty, and it was done so in a very sexual way. The book puts you in the mind of a paedophile. It was unsettling and sickening. In my opinion the Author created a real life monster. I don’t exactly know what compelled me to finish this book. Perhaps I wanted to see Humbert punished in some way."
5,Charly,1216,1215,This was a second read on Lolita for me the first was a long time ago. Nabokov writes a bit to an elitist audinece I think and he leaves something to be desired. Er....no pun intended. Far too much work for a fairly simple straight forward story line.
5,Dona,1217,1216,"Bahasanya terlalu 'berat', xixixi, jadinya bacanya 'dilompat-lompat'. Yang jelas, ceritanya tentang pria phedophilia (moga aja nulisnya gini) yang jatuh cinta sama anak tirinya Dolores Haze..hehehe"
5,Jason McIntosh,1224,1223,"... just kidding. but really i just couldnt dig this book the way everyone else seems to. i admit that i read it my first year of college for a class and i really hadnt been much of a reader yet. ecspecially of the so called ""classics""but in the class my proff kept arguing for the main hero/villan? saying that his love was pure this and societal norms aside that, and Lolita was a foul temptress and knew what she was doing. even if this is the case. it's an odd book with alot of creepyness to it. 2 stars."
5,AZ Beavers,1225,1224,"Well written, I know. But ARGH. No likeable characters, and Humbert's efforts to make his despicable behavior understandable or sympathetic are really hard to read. Not sure whether I should consider this a good book. I struggle with whether a book be good when it's about such ugly subject matter. But I read it b/c it's a classic and that's what we're supposed to do."
5,Charlene Carr,1228,1227,"So far, I feel as if this book is highly over-rated. I wonder if the notoriety that surrounds it is more because it focuses on such a controversial subject and not because of any actual superb quality of the writing. Though some moments are well-written, I'm about two-thirds of the way through and much of it seems to drag on and seems more self-important than genuinely engaging. "
5,Esther,1231,1230,"I've heard a lot about this book, how it is an accurate portrayal of love and lust. I found the topic interesting after reading a summary of it, and after finding it in my aunt's old room, decided to read it. Right from the very first page, everything was very hard to digest. I had to force myself to get through every page, because it wasn't captivating at all to me. Nothing in the story itself was enough to keep me reading, except for the idea of the story. I was able to feel the protagonist's pain, though, as he watched his Lolita from afar and lusted for her. For people who have suffered from the depths of love, some may find this book touching and compelling. For some however, it might be a book you have to force yourself to read."
5,Charu Thapliyal,1238,1237,"Honestly, I couldn't finish the book, even though i was halfway through it, because i found the content a bit too creepy for my liking. The writing style is pretty unique though. "
5,Nik,1240,1239,"Take away the very beautiful, good writing and this book is about a man, fixated on a lost love from childhood, never maturing to find women attractive who takes advantage of a situation in which he can have an affair with his step-daughter all the while knowing that once she matures he will no longer be interested in her."
5,Jocie,1242,1241,I just couldn't finish it. 2 stars because I do appreciate and understand why it's considered a classic - the writing is equally lush and creepy. But I can't get behind it and what it's about.

5,Moni,1246,1245,"Now, I realise this is a much adored novel but unfortunately I didn't find much here. I pushed on, as far as I could go, I made it through a substantial amount of the novel but beyond the rich aesthetic and deep and playful menace of the admittedly unforgettable Humbert Humbert I found little else. In fact I felt it was only that, drawn out to about 400 pages. Obviously this mustn't be the case for all readers, and of course I respect that, but for me-- an anticlimax. "
5,Carter,1248,1247,"This is my third time reading this book. It makes me uncomfortable every time, and I'm not really sure why I keep re reading it. Time to buy new books, I guess. "
5,Saheed Fatimah,1253,1252,In what planet is paedophilia ever okay? This book attempts to sympathise with a quite clearly mentally impaired man. 'The folds on her trousers' 'The slight bulge on the chest' ewwww!!!! A child may attempt to seduce an adult but the adult actually falling for such seduction???? No way is this okay. I found Humbert annoying and was glad when I finished reading.P.S There is nothing erotic about this book
5,Pamela,1255,1254,gotta tell you I was a little creeped out by this book
5,Paras Abbasi,1256,1255,"The only thing worth appreciable in the book was the protagonist's sense of humour. Though the book was poetic but the unnecessary drag, lack of dialogues and the way a Lolita let her be manipulated in spite of knowing what was happening to her made it much more preposterous than it ought to have been."

5,Brandy,1262,1261,Very hard to get through. To be honest I skimmed some chapters and watched the movie before book club meeting.
5,Carissa,1264,1263,"It is well-written. You can feel the emotions of the characters, including the creepy pedo, Humbert Humbert. It's depressing, actually."
5,Toppy,1266,1265,"The author captures obsessiveness masterfully, however, it went on a bit."
5,Angelica San Juan,1268,1267,"I find the story peculiar, but everything was well-written like how classics should be. But overall, the book was okay."
5,Shauna Tyndall,1269,1268,"Lolita is a mixed bag. While the writing is quite poetic, even whimsical at times, the book can be a bit confusing at times, particularly about the three quarter mark. A few times, I didn't even know which character was being referred to. Maybe I was just tired, but it was off-putting in a big way. I had no strong feeling for any of the characters, although I found Humbert vaguely amusing. "
5,Billy,1270,1269,"Not sure I understand the 'classic' status. I'd love to sit and debate it with someone one cold night with a beer and chattering people around, though, as I'm genuinely curious as to what makes this book special. Sure, it's an odd situation, though probably not as uncommon as people might think, and sure, the language and writing style is off-beat and at times really unique and pleasant to read, but I found myself frequently bored by the plot, in which about five things of great significance happen, and not really caring about any of the characters and what happens to them."
5,Kristy Trauzzi,1271,1270,"This book was not what I was expecting at all. While it wasn't graphic - I got so angry at him! Who was he to do that?! And blaming her!? She wanted it - she seduced him! As if pre teens even fully know what they want or totally what they are mimicking. Cuz that is what they are doing. They are copying what they've seen or dealing with the new emotions that they are going through. It's not meant for old men to take advantage of them. And then to shoot the guy who rescued her! Again, not what I was expecting when I wanted to read this novel."
5,puck,1272,1271,"Tehnic, Lolita este o carte căruia nu am avut ce să îi reproşez. Practic, mi-a fost greu să o citesc, şi asta pentru că am tot încercat să îmi imaginez un tip de 36 de ani în plin act sexual, cu tot ce implică lucrul ăsta, cu o fată de 12 ani şi recunosc că mintea mea s-a împotrivit cu înverşunare. I felt sick. "
5,Cheryl Petersen,1273,1272,What good is pretty writing when written from the perspective of a despicable character about a despicable subject? Honestly I do not get it. Maybe I am just not smart enough or literary minded enough to get this book. I mean I read some twisty books where horrible things happen - but there is generally some sense of right and wrong and the pursuit of justice... but this.... it was obsessive and dare I say boring.This book had long been on my to be read list because it was on the 100 must read and Powell's 25 must read before you die.... bet seriously I just do not get it.

5,David Pimenta,1275,1274,"Foram inúmeras as vezes em que coloquei a ideia de desistir da leitura deste livro de lado e quando ela começa a fazer-se sentir na minha cabeça não é lá muito bom sinal. A maioria das críticas que tinha lido sobre Lolita eram positivas, favoráveis e por isso comecei a ler com bastante curiosidade. E agora sinto-me com dificuldades em escrever a crítica com base numa leitura incompleta. Cheguei à página 220 mas como não estava a tirar prazer da minha leitura resolvi parar.Lolita conta a história de Humbert Humbert na primeira pessoa. Tomamos conhecimento de que está preso (e, sinceramente, não consegui chegar ao fim deste livro para saber a razão por detrás desta detenção) e a partir desse ponto, HH começa a contar-nos a sua história recorrendo à sua memória. A sua infância, tendo em conta o trauma com Anabela, até à idade adulta em que desenvolve uma atracção especial pelas “ninfitas” ou, para meros cidadãos, pelas meninas entre os doze/treze anos. Relata a sua mudança para Ramsdale, para a casa de Charlotte Haze e a obsessão pela sua filha de doze anos, Dolores ou Lolita, que irá ser uma peça importante para o decorrer da história.Para mim, esta foi uma história que custou a entranhar logo ao início. Não ganhei aquele gosto pela personagem principal mesmo sendo um monstro, na minha opinião. A obsessão, a descrição da paixão de Humbert pelas ninfitas fez-me especial confusão, tive de colocar um pequeno escudo nos meus pensamentos e dar ênfase ao pensamento “Isto é apenas ficção” para continuar a ler. Compreendo porque é que muitos consideram este livro como genial. Começando pela forma como foi escrito. É de louvar a escrita de Nobokov. Foi um dos aspectos que me manteve preso à Lolita mas não me fez ganhar a curiosidade para chegar ao fim do livro.A história enrola, enrola e volta a enrolar mais uma vez numa espécie de ciclo vicioso. Tudo o que acontece envolta de HH e Lolita não interessa e cheguei a achar as descrições bastante maçudas e muito prolongadas. Este pode ser um dos melhores livros que por aí andam mas não é por muitos gostarem que vou dizer que gostei.Não gostei deste livro. E a minha classificação só não é mais baixa devido a escrita fabulosa. Aconselho-o a quem aprecie clássicos. Lolita é um clássico e apaixonou muitas pessoas. Eu não fui uma delas, infelizmente.2/5 "
5,kylajaclyn,1282,1281,"The blurbs on this book (well, my copy of it) are both true and false. Vanity Fair proclaims this book ""the only convincing love story of our century."" False. But, on the back, John Updike says that Nabokov writes prose ""the way it should be written, that is, ecstatically."" True. Everything he writes in Lolita feels like a fever dream. Which probably isn't too far off the mark, since Humbert Humbert is an unreliable narrator. But, reliable or not, this book is still very troubling. I've had one teacher say several times that if you, at any point in the book, feel sorry or sympathize with Humbert, than Nabokov has succeeded at his job. This is a hot topic right now, particularly for women writers, but why do protagonists need to be sympathetic? Can't they just be a villain or repulsive and still have a compelling story that we don't need to sympathize with to be interested in or entertained by? I never once felt anything for Humbert. I'm pretty neutral to him overall. This is a man who, from the beginning of the novel, admits he has murdereristic (new word) tendencies that he later follows through on. This is a man who marries the mother of the 12-year-old girl he worships just so he doesn't have to leave her side. He then becomes the stepfather of Lolita and essentially kidnaps her and takes her around the country once her mother dies. Then he DRUGS Lolita so he can rape her in her sleep (thus somehow, though I'm not sure how in any mind, avoid taking her ""innocence""). Little does he know that she's already had sex at summer camp. The point of this book, for me, was to find out if they really were going to sleep together. They do, quite early on. But H.H. claims that Lolita came onto HIM, and this is especially troubling for me, because this is where we get the idea (or at least adding fuel to the idea) that little children should be sexualized and may, in fact, already be sexual creatures. However, Lolita is utterly ridiculous and whiny throughout the book, and she never seems to care much for her ""dad."" She sneaks away to ""cheat"" on him multiple times. But he also always wants sex from her and often bribes her for it in various ways. He keeps her prisoner, and this book is the best case for Stockholm Syndrome I can think of (well, maybe not entirely. She never completely falls in love with him, after all). Upon falling sick two years into their journey, she is kidnapped from the hospital by another man, her former drama teacher, while H.H. himself is sick and unable to be with her. H.H. spends the next three years in despair looking for her. When he finally meets Lolita again, she is 17 and pregnant and married (what a wonderful life). Not to the drama teacher, however, but to a different man. Naturally Lolita will not leave her husband for him, so H.H. hunts down Quilty, the drama teacher, and kills him. If this be love..."
5,Anna Carolina,1284,1283,"Lolita is a spoiled little brat, and Humbert is a pedophile. The story is disgusting, but the book is very well written and really worth reading."
5,Maren,1287,1286,"I really didn't like this book. During the summer I lived in Portland, I read 60 books, and a large majority had a predatory, male to young girl theme. Even Anais Nin. I was more than a little upset, and didn't actually finish because I just couldn't handle it at the time. Yea..."
5,Frank,1288,1287,"I didn't finish this book, I just couldn't get into it. The narrator is too clever and witty for his own good, and I think the novel suffers because of it. Maybe I will try to read it again in a year or two."
5,Abbie Clarke,1290,1289,"I liked the writing style of the author (even if it was a bit fancy for my simple mind) but really after only a few pages in, I was too creeped out by Humbert's way of thinking to continue. I know that it's not meant to advocate pedophilia but I just couldn't get over the way his mind worked. Lusting after pre-pubescent girls? No thank you! "

We are not sex fiends! We do not rape as good soldiers do. We are unhappy, mild, dog eyed gentlemen, or adults but ready to give years and years of lifefor one chance to touch a nymphet. Emphatically, we are not killers"""
5,Retrovold,1311,1310,"Well. It certainly was shocking and i am not that kind who wouldnt like this literature. But I expected lot more, maybe deeper story, maybe more psychological story, maybe little older lolita and little more between chapters before actual act. I love way Kubrick turned this book into brilliant movie and given time this was not only shot but also published by Nakov, it certainly takes guts. But I was dissapointed with storyline, even though it could be fantastic. "
5,Jane Geist,1315,1314,"Very hard for me to read. It is a literary example of excellence, but the subject matter was way too disturbing and the pace was too slow."

5,Shae,1321,1320,"This book was difficult to read, which is understandable given its quite controversial subject. The narrator is a despicable and detestable man who would perhaps garner pity or at least minor sympathy from the reader (he often pleads for this very thing throughout the story), had he not been a man lusting after a child. "
5,Farnoosh Brock,1323,1322,"This is a book review and my perspective based on honest effort to read Lolita not once but twice, and each time I got through only the first 30 to 50 pages, so take away what you wish. It is my true honest feelings.Here goes: I Just couldn't get past the eekiness of it all. I could not get over the old man seducing a young under-age girl and seeing it as ""literary"" and I'm perfectly fine with that. If after two sincere attempts to appreciate the book,I still could not get into it, then perhaps sometimes, even great works of literature are not for all of us. I would have given it a 1-star but I want to be generous and give it a 2-star if only because my very literary friend Rebekah shared some insights that I could have appreciated, had I read more into the book.... but alas, I didn't. If I ever pick up Nabokov again, I will update my review here."
5,katie,1324,1323,"When I say I 'finished' this book, I spent the majority skipping over parts. I was very disappointed-after hearing such wonderful things-and I don't have a specific reason as to why. I felt like a lot of the book had no relevance to the plot and I easily became bored. After reading briefly what happened in the end, it sounds like a really fantastic book but unfortunately I couldn't get into it and I didn't enjoy it. "

In the classroom he guides her hand under the desk where he sits. He sucked the blood of a mosquito bite on her shoulder in complete rapture - yuck!I couldn't even tell you how good the writing was, because I held the book by my fingertips and read as fast as I could...too afraid that the creepiness would rub off."
5,Tommy,1335,1334,"I felt like this book was totally overrated. The writing was occasionally good but not overwhelmingly great and I found the plot slow and repetitive. I'm sure it was controversial at the time and that's helped it's classification as a literary classic, but at the conclusion I'm just left with a shrug. I didn't care particularly for any of the characters. They are all self-important and self-absorbed to the point of being repetitive, boring and annoying. They don't develop or go anywhere. Wouldn't recommend it being worth your time. "

5,Ellie C.,1341,1340,"This book is well-written, and yes, impressive use of the English language. It also creeped me out. I did not sympathize with the narrator, because to my mind there is no excuse for violating a child. It is an interesting read, but not one I enjoyed. Were the subject matter different, I would give this book five stars. I give it two because of how revolting I find the actions of H.H. As someone who works with children, I tend to see the work more from a child's point of view and found it painful to read. I feel that part of the ""acclaim"" of the book was due to it's subject matter, and it has been glorified for being extreme. "
5,Leon,1345,1344,"If Nabokov had decided to include line breaks in his magnum opus Lolita and claim it was an epic poem, I doubt few would have batted an eye. This novel written as a memoir of obsessive pedophile Humbert Humbert is nothing if not lyrically florid. Nabokov's skill with the English language eclipses that of the average storyteller - in fact, his English is so hyper-fluent that he dips into French.Yet if Nabokov wields his linguistic prowess as a shotgun, he loads it with foam pellets. Lolita is like a Romeo and Juliet without the feuding families and the deaths. That is to say, the plot is for the most part a meandering journey with a destination already met, not unlike a plane taxiing around its arrival gate. The characters also do not command much force. From the book's inception to its denouement, Humbert is characterized as a pedophile, no more and no less. Even the eponymous Lolita (aka Dolores Haze) remains arguably little more than the object of Humbert's amour, not to mention how disposable the other characters are (and they are disposed of indeed - few characters last more than a handful of chapters).It can be deduced that this book is less about its plot and characters as it is about the idea: an homage to unsanctioned love. Similar to the piece Homage to the Square, Lolita thus bears artistic merit. Still, with both, this reader would have preferred more content in the traditional sense.Finally, there is the frustration in dealing with the writing style. A single sentence may last half a page or more and address everything and nothing at the same time. It is commendable, though, that even with this particular subject, Nabokov declines to stoop to explicit sex scenes. E.L. James would have had a field day.I would give a guarded recommendation to Lolita based on this first reading, but there are possible reasons to revisit this declared masterpiece. Nabokov's writing is surely something to aspire to, and who knows what a might closer reading might reveal?Overall: 7/10P.S. Were there really ""morning snow storms of used tissue paper that a train passenger sees whirling in the wake of the observation car"" (p.15)? If so, I am glad we are now beyond such barbarism."
5,Vencislav Popov,1346,1345,"This joins the ranks of all the books I tried to read because they are either classics or touted as classics-to-be, which in the end I could not finish for the life of me. The language is a delight and it excited me in the beginning, but aside from that reading it was an utter drudgery. What is the point of being able to weave beautifully intricate webs of words, if your choice of subject matter is appalling and the story is going nowhere? Oh, well, this seems to be an intrinsic quality of most classics or overly-hyped books I dread - all talk and no substance. If your building is crumbling who cares if the facade is breath-taking?"
5,Elaf,1347,1346,"I rarely write reviews but here goes. I didn't like the plot or the story, cause I hate his act and I find his justification as well as his personality to be weak. He managed to make me want to know the ending that was realistic."

5,Don Gubler,1358,1357,I am not particularly impressed.
5,Kakihara,1368,1367,"I just don't know where to begin... Seems to me that Mr. Nabokov wanted to be a Mr. Humbert Humbert back in the 50´s but he wasn't able to do so, so he decided to write a book about his feelings, as it happens now a days to many either men or women that wish they had their own Lolitas. Although I continue to believe there is a Lolita in every single woman and sure there has to be a Mr. Humbert in every single man that doesn't really mean we can not control those feelings about people we are to love. Mr. Humbert is actually a controller, he does not really care about Lolita´s feeling and welfare, he only cares about himself, about his life about his soul. He fears to be lonesome, all by himself (He should´ve read Bridget Jones Dairy or at least written something like this instead). If Dolores´ mother hadn't passed away... sure the book might´ve been called differently... so it is really hard for me to say that moral Mr. Humbert was really in love with Lo, at least Lolita was not in love with him and was even brave enough to run away from that kind of filthy men and start a new life after all... good for her bad for Mr. Humbert who even to the end of the novel, continues to justify his sort of greedy LOVE. "
5,Gabriela Pop,1371,1370,"While the writing style itself was rather familiar with it's typical European je ne sais quoi,the story was dreadful.Don't get me wrong,I was expecting something controversial,knowing the main ideas behind the book,but this was pure crazy.I have never hated a character as much as I have the protagonist of this,I found him utterly dreadful and his view on life and everything else disgusting.Sadly,there weren't any other characters to like,there was honestly nothing I personally liked about this story and I surely wouldn't recommend it."
5,Claire Smith,1373,1372,"It was difficult to rate this book. From a purely technical writing perspective, it was very good. But the topic made me feel like I was reading the book at arms length with my head partly turned away. It had a morbid fascination, abit like that maggoty dead cat you can't not look at in the gutter.It's been described as a great love story, and the story of a sexually precocious girl, but quite frankly I saw no evidence of love. Lolita is described as crying every night, she plots to run away from from vain, arrogant Humbert. Humbert abuses her sexually,physically and psychologically. He steals the money he brides her with, he rapes her when she is unwell, he kills the man who eventually helps her escape (who incidentally delivers her to what sounds like a house of sex slaves). Yes she was sexually precocious, at 12 she has sex with a boy her own age, but I feel this does not excuse his actions . She develops a crush on Humbert, but there is no excuse for him taking some extensive advantage of her. I'm glad I read it, but I don't feel it provided me with any new insights into a paediophils psyche. Of course this is not the point of hte book."

5,Monique,1381,1380,"Lolita is a condemnable book. I don't understand why it should be a book you must read. Nabokov's way of writing is beautiful, although sometimes a little boring, but the story about a adult man having a sexual relationship with a 12 year old girl isn't what I would like to call a must-read."

В началото книгата будеше в мен възмущение не толкова от дългите изречения, описващи блудкав еротизъм, колкото от представата на автора за себе си - сякаш е рокзвезда, която е свикнала да вижда възхищението на жените в очите им, но той да ги презира като боклуци, защото, видиш ли, предпочита десетгодишните. Втората част на книгата вече е една върла скука, която се преодоляваше само с надеждата, че в края на романа героят може и да се застреля. Тази надежда обаче не бе достатъчно силна, за да дочета книгата докрай и най-безцеремонно се обръщам към филма за чаканите отговори."

Given it wasn't the best life but she did leave him, and despised him for what he did to her for years. This book is very contreversial for me."
5,Jonathan Card,1401,1400,"May be the theme of this novel was scandalous and tabu at the time it was written. I found this novel boring,and repetitious. The use of French language was excessive, It was perhaps more to show the knowledge of French by the author than to enhance the narrative. I did not like at all the excessive use of page after page written in columns of one or two letters. It was sometimes difficult to make sense of it. Overall a mediocre book. It was simply...ok. "

5,Nadia Krushelnitskaya,1407,1406,"Beautifully written, but very disturbing and depressing story."
5,Montikupcakes,1410,1409,"Abandoned this 69% through (And yes, I see the cheeky coincidence in that. Sex puns, we get it)Lolita has quite the stigma, which both enticed me to and alienated me from read it. I think in general, based off of what I was able to stomach, Nabokov is a gifted and natural, enthusiastic writer. The majority of his prose is aesthetically pleasing (I do love me a good juicy bit of imagery!) and enjoyable to read it but every once and a while, his writing still would drift off into the overwrought and ridiculous, boring (so, so numbingly boring) and contrived. Pages upon pages of description I didn't find necessary or interesting (or similes that were too cheesy or fluffed up even for me, a lover of all things cliché) interrupted the flow of the narrative and left me struggling to keep the pages open.I really wanted to finish and enjoy this book for many reasons— because it's a classic, because I wanted to understand if the controversy of the novel is much more complex than the creepy, pedophiliac stigma it has, and for more selfish reasons, I want to return to the level of avid reading that I have recently lost and finish a book, something I've found hard to do lately— but I can't do it. Obviously I haven't finished it but from what I read, I haven't found any satisfaction in Nabokov coming to an enlightened conclusion of the undeservingly-romanticized May-December dynamic in the novel and I don't feel any sympathy for the narcissistic protagonist Humbert. Maybe the rest of the book does show a moral about not dismissing Humbert's obsession as love or passion— because that's not what this is—, but I don't think I can keep reading to find out. All in all, I don't think we can dismiss that Nabokov knows how to wield a pen and write gorgeously, but I don't think the story could have been drawn out as long as it was. But that is simply my opinion, my perspective could stem from me being a bit restless and impatient depending on the book (which can make reading a little difficult). So, if anyone else has read it and found it better than I did, tell me why, and perhaps in a few years when I distance myself from it I'll give Lolita another chance.I wish there was a 2.5 star rating, the extra .5 score being because Lolita must be a classic for a reason, and because at rare points the book was slightly stimulating and a pleasant, swift read."
5,Kaat V,1413,1412,"Lolita van Nabokov aan het lezen. Het boek kwam hier in mijn bezit wegens de aktie 'verboden boeken' van De Morgen. Het valt mij moeilijk een boek niét uit te lezen, omdat ik mezelf dan verdenk van gebrek aan doorzetting dan, of mezelf wijsmaak dat ik ook dingen moet lezen die mij niet in de smaak vallen, zoals ik in Azië of in de Magreb ook wel dingen proef die ik ook niet zo vlug zou eten hier. Maar om zo in de geest van een pedofiel kruipen ... het is bijna teveel gevraagd. De man heeft maar één verlangen : zijn seksuele driften bot te vieren op nimfijnen, oftewel meisjes tussen de 8 en 14. Alles is daarvoor goed : het gebruik van pillen, en als het nodig zou blijken, het vermoorden van de moeder. Een ziekelijke geest is het. Maar ziekelijk staat niet voor 'niet te verantwoorden'. In mijn zoektocht naar achtergrond informatie vond ik dat het bij sommige Nederlandse scholieren op de boekenlijst van het vierde jaar staat. "
5,Beth Morris,1416,1415,"Sorry folks. I know the topic of Lolita is very scandalous and has been banned for unfit content, but I found this book incredibly boring. I couldn't take anymore of the traveling dialogue. I found myself skimming and skimming the more I read. The beginning was interesting as was the end, but the middle barely held my attention. "
5,Rachel Swords,1417,1416,"""Lolita"" is, without a doubt, one of the most controversial literary classics of time. Because of that, anyone who loves to read, or is an aspiring writer, or an English major, should read it. Though some of the shock value has worn off, ""Lolita"" is still an eyebrow-raiser of a book. Though pedophilia has become more visible thanks to media coverage, it's still shocking to see it defended and celebrated within the pages of Nabokov's work. By now, even casual readers know the basic plot: older man lusts after and has an affair with an underage girl. Humbert Humbert (WHY is he named that? Someone tell me) is one of literature's most debated anti-heroes. He's constantly feeling sorry for himself, and as the story progresses, the reader can see his relationship with Lolita, or Dolores as is the girl's real name, progress from infatuation, to lust, to borderline-psychotic possession. By the end, it's no wonder that his Lolita escapes him. And it is very obvious by the end that Humbert is unstable. For example: Humbert is devastated when Lolita tells him she will not return to him and says in so many words that she never loved him. He briefly considers his treatment of her over the years and seems remorseful-but only for a minute, choosing instead to wallow in self-pity and continuously place her on a pedestal. And then there is Lolita herself, Dolores Haze. Here's where the book gets really interesting: it's a bit hard to feel sorry for her, even though she is the victim of Humbert's affections and must grant him sexual favors for any semblance of a normal teenage life. She's a spoiled brat for the whole story, and I only felt for her when she was sick and during her final appearance in the story. Does she play upon Humbert's emotions at the beginning? Possibly. The story is not clear; it's up to the reader. Does she deserve what she gets from him? Of course not. But over the course of the book, it's clear that she does her best to manipulate the situation, getting Humbert to buy her anything she wants. It's only as Dolores/Lolita advances in age that the story gets really dark and a genuine concern for this character arises: Humbert does not want his Lolita to become a young woman, and does everything in his power to repress this natural stage of life, by forbidding her fraternization with boys her age, throwing out any makeup she owns, and stealing money from her. The most alarming section was, for me, when he interrogates her activity with a classmate from school; it's in this scene that we see how disturbed Humbert is, and how possessive he is of his young stepdaughter. Now that I've written a book on the book, all I can say is go read ""Lolita."" If nothing else, you'll get to see what all the fuss is about. "
5,Margie,1420,1419,Always heard about this book. Decided to try it myself. Not anything like I had anticipated. The author goes on and on. The Character Humbert is a very unstable individual. The girl is also unstable but I felt she was trapped into the relationship and found a way to leave. I would not recommend this to people growing up in our culture today.

5,Tita,1431,1430,"Sebelum ini, saya hanya mendengar reputasi buku Lolita ini. Setelah membaca sendiri, rasanya Lolita kok nggak sehebat pamornya. Mungkin ini dipengaruhi harapan yang terlalu tinggi, atau mungkin juga karena ada rasa nggak 'sreg' membaca versi Indonesianya. Mungkin, suatu hari, kalau dapet versi Inggrisnya akan saya coba baca lagi... "
5,Vee,1434,1433,"Though I appreciate the use of language is incredible, I found this to be very uncomfortable reading. I didn't finish it. Maybe at a later date I will. "
5,Emily Wicks Escott,1435,1434,Honestly if I didn't have on audio book i'm pretty sure I never would have finished it. It is written very poetic and written beautifully but I just could not get into it. I feel like it is an important piece of literature and that is the only reason I gave if 2 stars.

5,Yvensong,1442,1441,"I'm having a real hard time rating this novel. The writing is superb. Nabokov's grasp of the English language is amazing considering this is his third(?) language. The storyline, the protagonist, and pretty much all the other characters are unlikeable or too shallow to care about at all. You only see the other characters through the eyes of the protagonist, and he's so twisted that only seeing these other people as unlikeable and/or shallow works well for the story. He really only pays any real attention to his Lolita, the young girl he's convinced himself that he loves. There were times I had considered not bothering to finish the story, yet like watching a train heading toward its doom, I followed Humbert through the well-written prose to his impending doom. I still can't say whether I'm glad I did or not. "
5,Katherine,1443,1442,"To be honest, I could not finish this book. It was way too detailed and disturbing for my liking... I could not make enough time to want to read it and go through. I give it 2**s ... Maybe I will pick it up again when I decide to be more committed to it."
5,Ken Schroeder,1444,1443,"I get that we don't usually get into the mind of perversion and all that. But, #1: Why do I need to? #2: It gets kind of boring. ""I saw a beautiful nymphette with her supple..."". I feel like he says versions of that sentence like 15 times. "
5,Linsey Duckett,1445,1444,"I tried to keep an open mind, I really did, and the perverted nature of the book wasn't the reason I gave it a low rating. It was just a rubbish book."

5,Emily Ann Meyer,1447,1446,"I can see why this is considered a significant book. That does not mean I enjoyed it. In fact, I really had to push myself to not just toss it aside. It was mysogynistic and rather disturbing. I found the protagonist's rationalizations thought provoking, but by part 2 and the development of the narrative rationalizations, I was disturbed."
5,Sanam,1450,1449,"I found this ""great book"" to be overrated. OK, so for the first 30 some pages, i was completely blown away. I had never read Nabokov; it was a revelation. I loved every word, and that i needed to keep a dictionary close by. Then, i got bored--his writing style was not enough to keep me engaged. I found the story and characters boring, repetitive, and unconvincing. It took at least 3 months for me to get the motivation to finish it. I was relieved to put it away and it is even tedious for me to think/write about the experience. 2 stars for the initial, short-lived love."
5,Will Whatley,1452,1451,"I don't think I gave Nabokov a fair chance on my go-round with this. So I actually don't know if the novel is just not that great, or if I slighted it by reason of prudery or haste."
5,Taylor Dinehart,1453,1452,"Ugh. How completely boring can one book be? The writer lists every little tiny thing in his head and describes things in such detail that I had to skip whole sections to stop myself from falling asleep. I don't want to know every single state they travel to, or the name of every lodge, or every little inconsequential moment in Lolita and H. H.'s sad life. If fact, I felt nothing for either of the characters and didn't care what happened to them. I was not shocked and offended by Humbert's thoughts or actions, and I didn't think Lolita deserved anything better than what she got. Also, the dialogue was stilted and just odd. Overall, an very unsatisfying and sleep inducing read."
5,Nicola,1457,1456,"Well I can truthfully say that reading Lolita is something I have been meaning to do for many years, so in that sense I'm delighted to have done so. For the rest... I'm not as impressed as I thought I would be. The writing is beautiful and the memories and desires inside Humberts head suitably skin crawling, the narrator, Jeremy Irons certainly did a fine job bringing him to life.With all that though, hmm, I'm still a trifle disappointed.I had read many reviews commenting about feeling sympathy for the monster, some which even suggest it was a little romantic and I can honestly say that these comments shocked me more than anything in the book. Due to these sorts of phrases I expected Humbert to cover his tracks more than he did, to present himself in a better light, but, no. His every disgusting thought, his hypocrisy concerning his nightly rapes, everything was laid bare. There was no verbal seduction, the vile Humbert stood bare, condemned from his own mouth. So, I was disappointed; I wanted a moral conflict within myself and there was none.For the rest I thought it dragged, the last half of the book that is.

5,Fatema,1462,1461,"Honestly speaking, I could not finish this book. It was recommended to me to see how weird it is, but I just could not continue reading it. One word: eww. "
5,Randy Ray,1463,1462,"I didn't care for the book. The narrator's voice was irritating, and his obsession with young girls, is pitiful and creepy. I'm not prudish, as a general rule, and I'm not offended by sexual content--I just didn't think Humbert Humbert (the narrator and main character) is someone I can relate to. I was surprised that I didn't get more enjoyment from this novel, as I liked Kubrick's film quite a bit."
5,Alexandra Hernández,1465,1464,"Se me hizo eterno terminar. Aunque debo admitir que hubo capítulos que sí disfruté, siento que hubo mucho relleno. Me sorprende la empatía que llegué a sentir por Humbert, aceptando su pedofilia y sin embargo sufriendo también por todo lo que debió pasar Lo."
5,umberto,1467,1466,"I read about this notorious novel in the early 60's while studying in a secondary school. From a Thai semi-academic journal, I first knew its strange, improper episodes between an oldish man and a youngish girl named Lolita whose age & innocent beauty unintentionally entice the man who appears to know & travel with her mother. It was quite a psychological uproar then, I mean it was one of the hot issues in the decade worldwide regarding the novel content and such perversion of those unthinkable couple inapproprite to any female teenager or gentleman to follow suit. A few years ago, I decided to buy this paperback to read but I couldn't keep going due to my gradually lost interest (I'm too busy to waste my time) so I stopped somewhere and would resume reading it according to my sufficient familiarity with some of his works."
5,Pukapuka,1468,1467,I bought a beautiful copy of this second-hand. I love the word Lolita. I thought i'd enjoy the story ... but waaaaaaaaay too pervy for my liking ... H.H is just creepy. I'm sure there's people out there just like him and others that sympathise with him. But do I want to read about them...NAH. It is well written...but ewww I feel dirty having read it.
5,Shonna Froebel,1469,1468,"This is one of the ones that everyone has heard about, but not a lot of people seem to have read. I finally decided to tackle it as I heard this audio version was very good.Jeremy Irons does a wonderful job on bringing this novel to life.The novel was so different than I expected it to be. So much sadder than I had thought. It also covered so much of America of that time period that really gave me a feel for the culture of the time.It was sometimes hard to remember that this novel was set in the late 1940s and early 1950s, as there seems to be so much going on that I thought of as being more recent. I loved the descriptive passages, both of the geography and culture of the travels, and of Humbert's description of the people he interacted with, especially his descriptions of Lolita.Lolita is knowing, yet naive; complicit, yet coerced; and this duality of her nature makes her even more interesting.Some of the middle dragged a bit for me, so I was glad of the wonderful audio to keep me going with it. The end was worth it."
5,Rosie,1470,1469,Uncomfortable reading in parts but Nabokov's use of language is brilliant
5,Ym,1471,1470,"Overrated.'It will change the way you think' and 'it's disquieting because it makes the reader sympathize with a pedophile' - nope, not in the least. He's a disgusting, morally void pervert. Period.The prose is unexceptionable and beautiful at times, however, and the character development well executed. Hence the two stars."
5,Crisel Blenda Bautista,1474,1473,"The unconventional and disturbing confession of Humbert is totally different from all the stories we have today or to all the stories that I have read so far. With the character’s point-of-view, the author was able to create a powerful, real and unique character as well as interesting subjects.Humbert’s character is both interesting and disturbing. The author’s explicit and creative telling of his character’s motive is enough for the readers to understand the dilemma the character is feeling. Furthermore, with the author’s ingenuity, it was understandably conceived in the story, the deep love he is feeling for Lolita. With unconventional use of words and incorporation of literary devices, such as metaphors and allegories, this world of Humbert became real. I may express my fascination towards the book, but in reality, it doesn’t suit my interest. Having no native tongue with the language that the author used, I had a hard time understanding what is being conveyed. In some occasions, my mind wanders while I was reading. Being lost during in the story really upsets me. My mind can’t seem to comprehend the unfamiliar and totally absurd words or phrases and metaphors present in the book. The use of French is also a pressure on my part, as it adds to my increasing confusion. With my limited capacity to comprehend the style of the author in storytelling, I have failed to notice small details that make up the totality of the story.But I think, more than Humbert’s character, Lolita herself is an interesting and “good different” character. Creating the topic about pedophilia may utterly disturb others but it can also kindle fires of understanding towards these kinds of characters. Books are meant to give us something, it can be a lesson or experience that we are yet to experience. But what this particular story has given its readers is the kind of love that is unfamiliar and impossible. I am not condoning such act, but to put it into words with creativity is something. Literarians will surely enjoy reading this. Critics, I think will be pleased, since it has transcended the common expectations for books. However, for an ordinary reader who seeks pleasure in reading, and moralist, I guess, this book is too much. The StoryThe story is about a twenty plus year old man called Humbert, who romantically and sexually desired female child half of his age. This desire seems to be rooted when he was young and was about embark in sexual endeavors with his childhood friend, Annabel. But Annabel died and he was left curious. And that curiosity remains with him until he gets old. Now, he continues to seek the companionship of partners too young for him. Later on, he married with the thought that his desire will disappear. But to his dismay, his random copulation with his wife only sparks more fire in him in desiring younger maidens. His wife has also grown cold towards him. Not long enough his wife asked for divorce since she has fallen in love with a man during their marriage and wishes to live with this man. Humbert was furious especially when his wife has introduced the man to him. He tried to control himself from not killing the two. After that encounter, he let himself fall in his immoral desire. He sought the company of young whores, but before he could enjoy the child, he was caught. He tried to prove his innocence just to get out of the situation. Fortunately, because of his creative excuse of using the child as a literary subject for his project he was acquitted of the crime. He was about to live with a friend, but due to some unfortunate circumstances he was led to live with the Haze. Here, he was welcomed by Charlotte Haze a widow and the mother of Lolita. Upon seeing the beautiful and young Lolita, Humbert knew that he has to be with this child. He looks Lolita not with a father’s eye, but with a deprived lover.Lolita, being young, stubborn and rebellious has shown motives towards Humbert making his desire towards her unbearable. So when Lolita left for summer camp, he thought of ways on how to be with his love. Fortunately, to his part, he found himself being desired by Lolita’s mother, Charlotte. Charlotte has expressed her love to him and told him to leave the house immediately if Humbert doesn’t feel the same way too, for staying in the Haze’s house after this confession will become difficult. Upon knowing this, Humbert accepted her love. He knows that once he is wed with Charlotte being with Lolita will be easier and he will not be suspected of anything since he will become the legal father of the child. He let Charlotte do everything and pretended to love the woman. Charlotte was utterly happy with the requited love she has received from Humbert but was devastated immediately when she found Humbert’s letters which explicitly tells his motive why he has wedded her. Furious, he confronted Humbert. Humbert tried to explain to appease her. But she was too hurt that she drove away until she met her end in a fateful accident. With what happened, Humbert was left with the guardianship to Lolita. He immediately went after her. Lolita with all her youthfulness and beauty was made to live with Humbert. They travelled far away from the people they know and Humbert made Lolita his little wife. He was able to get what he wanted. He was too happy to be with his love but also too anxious with her since she might tell others about their relationship and escape. He was able to convince little Lolita to not tell anyone about the two of them. However, it was not long when Humbert became unease and frantic when he found out that someone has been following them and Lolita is devising something with this suspicious man. After travelling and living only in hotels and motels, Lolita fell ill and was hospitalized, when she was about to leave the hospital, Humbert too, fell ill. He was unable to retrieve Lolita. This led him to be separated from her. When he recovered, he immediately looked for her but years passed and he failed to find her. Finally, after so many years, Humbert received a letter from Lolita telling him that she was married and pregnant and she needed financial help to sustain her current life. It was hard to believe, but when he saw Lolita with a swelling belly and the changed in her form, realities fell upon him. Losing his hope towards his Lolita, he gave her all the money more than what she expected, all from him and from the money left by her mother. But before leaving he wanted to know what happened the day they parted. He was furious to confirm his suspicion that the man following them before, was the one who kidnapped Lolita and ruined her. With vengeance, he sought the man and put justice in his hands as he theatrically killed the man whom he believed is the cause of all his heart’s sorrows. "
5,Gloria Shealtiel,1480,1479,"I was less able to enjoy the book.Since the narrative style seemed very real, I kinda got into the pedophile relationship AND I was pretty frightened, made me not comfortable reading.But anyway, beyond my very personal perspective, this book is remarkable. You'll see that the man loves Lolita because of a quite reasonable odd reason."
5,Simon_Cleveland_Ph.D. Simon_Cleveland_Ph.D.,1482,1481,"Is reading Lolita a memorable experience? Not in the least.In it's essence the book leaves a very unpleasant aftertaste with its central theme of pedophilia. I don't recommend the story to anyone neither for its writing style (there are so many other memorable authors to check out first: i.e. Franzen, DeLillo, Martin Amis) nor for the message. "

5,Cecilia,1501,1500,Tough to get through both in a literary sense and psychologically
5,Shayna,1502,1501,"This is a book I don't think I will ever be able to finish. As beautiful and bright as the writing is, the stark contrast of the content revolts me. I have a strong visceral reaction when I read it. After a few pages, I'm forced to put the book down for a year or so before I try to pick it up again. I've only been able to make it halfway through.Seeing the cover of the book on this page doesn't help either, because the featured girl is my darling niece's doppelgänger.I found a fellow reader's review that says everything I feel when reading this novel:This review says it all:Jan 04, 2012 Tatiana rated it:· review of another editionRecommends it for: those who will not fall for Humbert's liesShelves: classics, 1001, 2012, national-book-awardI wasn't even going to write a review of Lolita after finishing it, because, honestly, how many reviews does this classic need? That is, until I started pocking around and reading what others have to say about it. Many reactions to this book are puzzling to me. In this world of Jerry Sanduskys and such, there are still people who find this ""erotic,"" who in the end feel compassionate towards the narrator, who think that Lolita was the one who seduced and manipulated poor Humbert? Well, I beg to differ. Lolita is as erotic as Speak is pornographic. As for favorable opinions of Humbert, I guess it is possible this effect can be attributed to Nabokov's mastery of deception. Clearly, Humbert still, half a century after the novel's publication, manages to fool readers, and himself, into believing that he is a dedicated, caring lover, wounded and changed by an early tragic romance. Only occasionally does the truth bleed through his self-delusion - Lolita's wistful glance at a child sitting on his father's lap, a simple act that is forever sallied by Humbert's filth, her disinterest in life, her resignation to satisfy him for pocket money and permission to participate in a school play. No, Humbert did not fool me into feeling sorry for him. On a technical level, Lolita deserves full 5 stars - the language, the wit, the world play! - I don't think I've ever read anything like this before. But emotionally this look into a pedophile's psyche is so disgusting, I can't quite bring myself to rate it so. Humbert is so sickly real to me, with his apologies, justifications of his behavior, cowardice, sob stories and bending of reality, how does an author create someone like this? How did Nabokov get such an intimate knowledge of someone so despicable?"
5,Linda Matos Di Lascio,1504,1503,This is one of those books that plagues me because (as ashamed as I am to admit it) I never finished reading it. Once they got to their boring cross country trek of monotony I lost interest. I felt bad enough to try picking up where I left off many times but it always ends with me angered that I even tried. 
5,Luis,1506,1505,"In my honest opinion. My opinion. Mine. Opinion. Not necessarily true.The writing is too much. It is so magnificent at first. I thought, What a very lyrical way to start a book about a forbidden love. But then after a hundred pages or so, I started to notice it doesn't change. It won't change. (I peeked at the latter chapters.) Outstanding wordplay becomes too tiring for me to read. I couldn't understand the sentences without rereading them again 2-3 times. Or reading them slowly. By then I just gave up. I do not have every time in the world. I skimmed. I just decided to read the summary on the Internet. (A CRIME! I know. The story based on the summaries is actually interesting.)I repeat: Wordplay is genius. Too much wordplay is tiring and boring. For me.I mean, after some time, I just want to hear the story continuously. After some time, I do not want your excellent wordplay sacrificing my continuous indulgence of the story. I want the story, and if your writing helps the story, I will want it more. But if your writing hinders me to soak myself with the story, forget it and go straight to the point.I repeat: In my honest opinion. My opinion. Mine. Opinion. Not necessarily true to all. But I know some are with me with this opinion.Another note is I did note rate this book 2 stars because of pedophilia. Hell, I have read stories more disturbing than that. This is because I just cannot stand the writing anymore,, but the story is interesting.And I do not extremely hate pedos. For me, pedophilia is just another orientation. It so happens that, like say a guy wants another guy, a pedo likes a child. Simple. What makes pedophilia not acceptable is that a pedo, realizing he will not be sexually and acceptably satisfied for his WHOLE LIFE, becomes obsessed and he will be forced to find an illegal way to satisfy his lust. This is because we all know that a child doesn't have any idea about sex so it will always seem to every one that the pedo is forcing the child for a sexual act. And that act of forcing is the one we cannot accept today. It's rape. I don't want to accept pedophilia, not because of the wanting of a pedo to a child per se, but because of the things a pedo could do to an innocent child."

5,Summer,1513,1512,"A disgusting, perverted book about incest and child molestation. I've read a lot of reviews that said this book was controversial because it made you feel supportive of the man molesting his step daughter and uncertain of what was right and wrong. I didn't feel that way at all. I thought the man was a disgusting criminal who deserved to be locked away. "
5,Julie Depner,1516,1515,"A highly interesting book, rich language and a deliciously complex and taboo subject matter. Despite all this, it didn't really manage to enthrall me in the way I had expected. My verdict is that I am happy to have read it purely because it was interesting, not because I really enjoyed it that much."
5,Meredith Davis,1517,1516,boring and difficult to relate to
5,Andrea Dowd,1518,1517,"The only two reasons I gave ""Lolita"" two stars is because pedophilia is a bit difficult of a subject to read (especially when 90% of the reading of the novel took place on public transportation with small children around...gross) and because half of the book was continual rambling (because it's a novel about obsession). Aside from my pervert aversion, the writing was spectacular, vivid, and extremely descriptive. ""Lolita"" is one of those perennial ""read before you die"" book an it's no wonder. Read it because you should and put your uncomfortable feeling aside just to get a taste of Nabokov's prose."
5,Locked Asylum,1519,1518,"I really don't know what to say. My feelings are just so dual regarding this book. This is one of those books that you have to rummage for a while, I guess."
5,Brandice,1521,1520,"Parts of the book were interesting but overall I found it boring. The author has a very wordy writing style I began to find tiresome about halfway through. He paints some vivid images with all his words, but just became a little much once the plot started to wane. "

5,Wolverina,1525,1524,"Finished reading Lolita today, for a cheerful start to the New Year.I really can't write much about it here because despite my dislike of trigger warnings, it IS a very triggery kinda book. And creepy. Amazingly creepy.I didn't like it, but I'm guessing you aren't really supposed too. Or if you are, I am just not enough of an artist to care. The flowery language and descriptions is very pretty and all, but really the book goes on much too long, so it gets boring fast.Australia Post are still numbnuts for refusing to sell it amongst the other popular penguins though. It's a lot of adult things, but its not porn."
5,Shawna,1529,1528,"Middle-aged guy likes early-teenaged girls. And ruins Lolita's life. The language, most of the time, is not very explicit, but the concept is still disturbing. "
5,silvia ,1530,1529,"Se por um lado adorei o estilo de escrita de Nabokov, alias esse foi o factor crucial para não ter desistido desta leitura; por outro lado não achei a historia nada apelativa. Gosto de leituras pesadas, perturnadoras que me façam para para pensar e era disso que estava a espera em Lolita. Confesso que no inicio a odescrição da obsessão de Humber Humbert fez as mihas tripas mexerem-se em desconforto mas depois com mais do mesmo devo ter começado a ficar anestesiada eo aborrecimento apoderou-se de mim.O predador Humbert não é uma figura nada simpatica, mas é torna-se tão patetico que é dificil gastar energias a detesta-lo. Lolita é descrita apenas pela visão adulterada de humbert, nunca sabemos o que se passa realmente na cabeça dela, podemos imaginar obviamente. Mas para mim Lolita quase que não foi uma personagem real no livro, tive dificuldades para ver para alem da lolita fantasia e assim sentir simpatia pelo sofrimento da lolita real.concluindo foi-me dificil terminar este livro não por me chocar mas por me estar a casar um entediamento terrivel."
5,Sierra Stoney,1531,1530,"Well-written, but way too creepy for me to enjoy. It didn't help that a girl in my class asserted that it is the ""[best book] in the English language"". I could hold that phrase against the speaker, but I find it impossible to isolate the statement from the book as a whole. "
5,Tin Wee,1532,1531,"Enter the mind of a pedophile - he explores how it started in a frustrated young love, how he tried to get close to a landlady's daughter. He marries the landlady to stay close to the daughter, and subsequently brings her on a sordid tour of America after the landlady dies in a car accident, and takes revenge by killing the 'saviour' of the daughter. The book also details the moral deterioration of the daughter, and explore themes of escapism and human relationships - primarily through the lens of jealousy and different types of love. The prose is technically brilliant - despite the theme it was never vulgar, but the story itself is obscene and not for the faint of stomach."
5,Vera,1533,1532,"I obviously failed as a reader of this book.Vladimir Nabokov writes in his afterword that people who expected a book in the line of 'Memoirs of a Woman of pleasure' will be disappointed. He writes that readers got bored when the erotical scenes stopped. I guess I am one of those persons. So expectation ruined the experience? Maybe. I did enjoy Part I a lot. The first part of the book is about how Humbert got to learn Lolita, how he marries her mother just to be able to close to be her, and how he eventually rapes her after her mother dies (for which he, indirectly, bears the blame). There is this tension building up to that moment, and it's done beautifully. It's not the erotic that kept me interested, it just was the story. I found it intriguing to read what's going on in a paedophile mind, and a mentally distorted mind on top of that. But in Part II, when Humbert and Lolita start this endless, repetitive quest through the USA, I was bored as hell. Oh yes, the writing, of course the writing is genius. But I am a lover of stories, and I love stories written in beautiful language, but language certainly cannot make up for a lack of story. Certainly not if it's about 250+ pages."
5,Felix Schweizer,1537,1536,"might have been shocking, now it just seems bad"
5,Ivee,1539,1538,"The storyline was interesting and different and kind of weird! When I first started reading it, it was great, the writing was really sarcastic and funny and although the plot was weird I still found myself beginning to like the main character - although he really is a psycho. But then after I was about mid way through I felt the story was dragging on a bit, and the complex sentences that Nabokov used were starting to really get on my nerves - he's the type of author who really likes to go into the most tremendous unnecessary detail on absolutely irrelevant things. And then I realised that I wasn't reading the book for fun, but just to get it over and done with and onto another book. It's kinda sad really, I just think Nabokov could've laid of the excessive adjectives."
5,Shauna,1541,1540,"I almost quit reading this book about halfway through. I decided to finish, but still was skipping through some paragrahs and pages. I'm glad I finished, but still was not a favorite book, or one I would refer to my friends. I guess I just enjoy a happier (less pedophile) genre."
5,Stefania,1546,1545,Non si può dire che non sia un libro ben scritto. Quanto al contenuto... non sono una puritana ma mi ha fatta rabbrividire.
5,Stefanie,1547,1546,"I have the controversial opinion that this book is super creepy. Revolutionary, I know. At first, the manic rantings of the Humpbert character were oddly fascinating. There's a definite poetry to them. But it builds and builds until it's just too much and over-pretentious sounding. I won't pretend that some of the writing wasn't oddly beautiful, but it got so creepy and hard to follow. And after maybe 2/3rds of the book, I didn't even want to follow it.In a weird way, this book is ""good."" It accomplishes what it sets out to accomplish, I think anyway. But unfortunately what it wants to accomplish involves a lot of terrifying paedophilia and nonsensical ramblings of a psychopath. I know it's a classic, but I wouldn't recommend it. "
5,Christopherseelie,1548,1547,"Not what I expected. The Kubrick film (not his best work) ruined the plot-points for me, but that's hardly the reason one reads Nabokov. I found Humbert contemptable, and not because of the obvious repulsion. His arrogant narcisism made me wonder why I would spend an evening with this character, let alone 300 pages. Through his eyes, I don't ever quite feel like I know Lolita at all. She's lost in the arabesques of Humbert's posture.Nabokov shows technical grace in concieving this narrator. And there are a few true gems in the story's execution that evade conventional storytelling. But overall, I'm inclined to join the Nabokov-is-sterile-literature camp."
5,Yulenka,1552,1551,"This was such a weird book for me. Not exactly the genre I tend to use. I found the story to be interesting, however the writing style was slightly frustrating at time. It felt like Nabokov took every sentence, and deep fried it in synonyms, adverbs, adjectives and casual asides. It was littered with vague references which I sometimes got, but who's presence made the book feel like I was wading through a swamp to get to the end of it. Story-wise, it was good but perhaps Humbert could have gone through the details and high points a little faster, the book felt a slow and was not a book that I couldn't bear putting down. (Took me so long to finish it!)However, the perspective was interesting if not unsettling. "
5,Ashleigh,1553,1552,"I had HIGH expectations of this. I thought I was going to love it as much as I loved The Virgin Suicides. I thought it would have that same old world feel about it. Suffice it to say it did not deliver for me. I don't know whether its my fault for building it up in my head or if I am not intellectual enough to really understand the story but I hated Humbert. I absolutely got bored out of my skull reading his wittering, poncy language. And oh my god the French?!?! What a prize arse Humbert was. I mean what (other than infuriating the reader beyond repair) was the point in the ridiculous, arrogant fragments of French language? I for sure wasn't going to look up every one to see what the crap he was talking about. The whole thing for me just reeked of pretention and quite frankly he just seemed to think he was above everyone. (not the authors style but the character of Humbert which you cannot get away from as the narrator) I just did not care about him one bit. I don't think I have ever encountered a main character quite as loathsome as he was, and for that Nabokov deserves props. Lolita/Dolly was an interesting character and if the book had of been from her perspective I probably would have liked it. So in summary, I don't quite get it. I don't get the hype. I don't understand how everyone wasn't raging inside like I was by the time they finished. I felt like I missed the point of it all because of Humbert's bumbling and babbling. I feel the need to read more by this author but not just yet. This book left me feeling inadequate, unintelligent and bored out of my wits. I was so utterly thankful when I finally finished, then I read Nabokov's interview at the back and I was totally dumbfounded that I could have missed all these points he made. It feels a bit like I don't really know what I have read. And I will not be in a hurry to read it again."
5,K8,1554,1553,This book was not for me.
5,Agape,1556,1555,"Can't understand why it's a classic. To me, it's more like a textbook for pedophile."
5,Jessica Bang,1562,1561,"Almost three stars, only because the last third of the book really picked up with everything spiraling into madness. Overall, though, not quite my cup of tea. "
5,Jonathan Hiskes,1564,1563,Eh.
5,Cody Lakin,1570,1569,"Oh, Lolita. It being the enduring and praised classic that it is, it feels strange to give it just two stars, but honestly, I'm writing this review from a purely personal standpoint, a reflection of my reaction to this book. So, disclaimer, I give it two stars and write this review not because it's a bad book, but because, personally, I could barely stand it, and reading it was kind of like torturing myself.One aspect that I appreciate, but what also makes this book what it is, is that it's actually told from the point of view of the pedophile. The main character, who I was at once disgusted by, and sometimes even felt bad for, is poetic and romanticizes things and is very much a weirdo, and the story, as you likely know, is centered around his uncontrollable love and lust for the twelve-year-old girl, Lolita. The story had its moments of humor, though those were mostly lost to me because there was very little I actually liked at all about the story, and at times you're even meant to feel bad for the main character, and I came close at one point, the shining moment of the story that I won't give away. However, atop the many aspects of the story and the idea that I strongly didn't like, this story is loaded with the most convenient moments of deus ex machina I've ever seen. Something's needed for the plot and for the main character to be able to proceed along a certain path that the story obviously wants to go? Sure: if the plot requires it, it's sure to happen. And at one event, a turning point in the story, the convenience of what happened was so overwhelming I almost set it down there and then, and maybe should have, leaving me thinking: This is the masterpiece people talk about when they talk about Nabokov? So, I appreciate the point of view, the writing, how different and how controversial it is, but at the same time, it was just too much for me.I picked this book up with the intent of expanding my literary horizons, and also because I knew little about it, little about Nabokov, and I couldn't decide between Chekhov and him, and sort of wish I'd gone with Chekhov. Lolita is very well written, needless to say, but it was just too gross and tasteless and overall bizarre, lacking in any sort of redeeming qualities, for me to stand behind. And I even love darkness in books, dark and sometimes disgusting things, but something about this book, probably how adamantly it seems to be justifying its own stance because of the first-person point of view, that threw me off."

5,Joanne Tranchemontagne,1577,1576,"oh dear lord it was so trying to get through this book. HH and Lo deserve each other. The annotated version was overwhelming...notes longer than the novel! While I appreciate all the solecism, solipsism, Poeisms, lepidoptery, tautologies, etc. etc. etc., I'm so glad it's over."
5,P.j.,1579,1578,Maybe it is me or maybe it is the hype...not sure but not on my favourites list 
5,Peter,1580,1579,"“She was Lo, plain Lo, in the morning, standing four feet ten in one sock. She was Lola in slacks. She was Dolly at school. She was Dolores on the dotted line. But in my arms she was always Lolita.” Like the vast majority of the Western world I knew the basic story for this book but had never actually read it so felt that it was time to put that right. Sadly I was rather disappointed with it.The subject matter did not really bother me (despite having a daughter myself) as I'm not so naive to believe that pedophilia does not exist or always has nor do I believe in censorship. Anyway anyone opening this book and expecting salaciousness will be disappointed because although we know that sex goes on within it the actual act is never truly visible. The narrator tries to justify his actions and by suggestion that he did not have to drug Lolita, as he intended, before the first time that he abused her that she was somehow complicit in her downfall but as a reader we soon realize that he is not overly reliable.He endeavours to control Lolita ,by threats rather than physically force, to make her comply with his actions even going as far as using her to bring over 'nymphets' into their house for him to ogle but these are the words of the narrator rather than the author. Some regard this as a love story but personally I don't see it. Yes, Lolita is reliant on HH but I never felt that any love was reciprocated by her rather this is a novel about obsession. Lolita.Lolita speaks little throughout and always remains an enigma despite the book being named after her which is another clever ploy IMHO.Many reviewers regard this book as a modern classic and there is no doubt it is a remarkable book especially as it was written in English rather than the author's own first tongue. Also the fact that the narrator is also a pedophile and as such a anti-hero is quite remarkable.Now I'm sure that many will disagree with me but I actually enjoyed the first half of this book,despite or maybe because of the subject matter,but disliked the second half despite. The second half, as the narrator slips into madness,was just overly descriptive and therefore the plot became ponderous and it stretched credulity just too far for my taste with the seemingly pointless second road-trip.The cover blurb talks of dark humour within but personally I just didn't see it.But perhaps the worst part of this book for me was the constant addition of French phrases, after a while I just gave up looking for their translations. That said and done I'm glad that I've finally read it but whilst the imagery of the book will last the book itself will not. "
5,Pam Wright,1581,1580,Read it a long time ago and was not terribly impressed
5,Oztinhix,1582,1581,"Thirty-five percent through this book, I was unbelievably bored and in dire want to complete this book immediately. I trudged on, but the experience was sometimes painful. ""Oh my lovely Lolita""..yeah, ok, we get it. It didn't have to last that long....and let's throw in a description of Lolita playing tennis near the end, just for kicks."
5,Chia Shimin,1584,1583,"Nabokov, is without a doubt, masterly and ingenious in prose. He whips up such delectable sundaes of literary expression. With all awareness of his brilliance though, the moralist in me can't help but shy away from the subject matter of paedophilia. ""Where are you hiding, Dolores Haze?Where are you hiding, darling?(I talk in a daze, I walk in a maze,I cannot get out, said the starling.)""This insane tragedy of abuse and twisted self-righteousness of the Humbug perpetrator leaves me thoroughly shaken at my moral roots. But lest Nabokov accuses me of being one of those ""gentle souls who would pronounce Lolita meaningless because it doesn't teach them anything"", let me clarify that Lolita has indeed been a splendid walk in an ethereal lingo park. And I have emerged sassier in diction. So it's all only a matter of preference that I am inclined to rate Lolita a measly 2 stars. "
5,Jody,1587,1586,"I did not enjoy this book at all and found it very hard to get through because of the writing style as well as the content. It was like sorting through a madman's mind. The saddest part for me was that ""she had nowhere else to go..."""
5,Cara Brackstone,1589,1588,"Two stars for clever and poetic writing. And perhaps insight into obsession and paranoia. No stars for anything else. The pace dragged needlessly as protagonist (or antagonist?) Humbert wanked on about pointless detail. Given that the reader can only really despise the main character, ""listening"" to his POV is grating and I was glad to put the book away. If sitting in a confined space with a sociopath who doesn't stop talking is your idea of a good time, you'll love this book. "
5,Margaret Spielmann,1593,1592,"Typical Russian psychological attempt to detangle the mind of someone deranged. Check that off my list of ""classics"" to read."
5,Opunzia Espinosa,1594,1593,Abbandonato. Non sopporto il protagonista. Mi fa schifo proprio.
5,Cristina Boncea,1595,1594,"La început mi-a plăcut la nebunie...mai întâi povestea;Lolita e o fătucă care locuiește cu mumăsa. Apoi vine naratorul-personaj, Humbert Humbert, și din întâmplare, se cazează în locuința lor. O să plătească chirie. El știa dinainte că e pedofil. Fusese căsătorit și nefericit, o făcuse cu prostituate, câștigase bani-moștenire și fusese la sanatorii.El se îndrăgostește de Dolores Haze aka Lolita și și-o dorește doar pentru el. Își dorește ca maicăsa să moară... se căsătorește cu ea doar ca să poată fi mai apropiat de Lolita, în continuare în casa lor. Pe maicăsa o calcă mașina și Humbert o ia pe Lolita într-o călătorie foarte lungă cu mașina prin SUA. Fac mult sex. Asta durează un an și ceva. Apoi ea pur și simplu fuge cu un alt tip.Humbert crede că e fratele lui, dar apoi nu mai e nimic clar.Se enervează, suferă, stă singur ceva vreme... apoi primește o scrisoare de la ea, când Lolita are 17 ani. E gravidă, măritată și îi cere bani. Se duce la ea și îi dă 4000$ și ea nu vrea să vină cu el. Se duce la așa zisul răpitor și-l împușcă de mai multe ori până moare.Apoi teoretic e închis, dar partea asta nu e povestită... ci doar se exprimă între timp cu - onorată instanță -.Nu eram de acord cu oamenii care spuneau că Lolita e o simplă parașută, dar acum sunt.Și Humbert e doar un tip nașpa și vai de el și foarte plictisitor.Scenele de sex nu sunt descrise.Cartea ar fi putut avea cu ușurință 100 de pagini.Se plictisește veșnic și începe să admire natura... și o tot admiră și e groaznic.Și îmi amintește de cartea lu Vasile Rebreanu.O urăsc. Cred că filmele vor fi la fel de nasoale sau poate că nu...Toate speranțele-mi sunt năruite."
5,Stephanie Hanlon,1596,1595,"Although this is quite possibly one of the most linguistically superior books I have ever read, I don't like it. I think Nobokov is a pompous asshole who thinks he is better than everyone else. I understand that for someone not native to the English language to perfect it as he did is quite an accomplishment. He does not, however, have to continuously insult the newness of America or the lack of, what he thinks to be, important knowledge among it's citizens. "
5,Isaac Timm,1603,1602,"hmmmmm, it took me a while to read this, it runs a little long and the arc is fairly predictable, but this is how you write an unreliable narrator. I can see Lolita's merit in the modernist canon, but can't say I enjoyed it. "
5,Mutant Supermodel,1604,1603,This is a tough one to judge. It wasn't as engaging as I thought it would be given what I had heard from other people. I found the narrator to be sort of obnoxious on more than one occasion. I also found it a bit confusing many times and wasn't sure exactly what or who he was talking about. I've heard Humbert Humbert described as charming and I just don't see it that way. I found him to be rambly and obsessive but hardly charming. The pedophilia aspect was disturbing at times but not as jarringly as I thought it would be. It just seemed too outlandish to really accept. 
5,Jade Vinatieri,1608,1607,Kind of disturbing but interesting. Poetic with hidden messages in words. 
5,Randi,1610,1609,Did not like it enough to finish ...
5,Dwayne Kavanagh,1611,1610,"I know raving fans’ll probably skewer me, but I really had a hard time getting through this book. I was looking forward to reading this book for years. I just finished it. The writing (prose/style) was fantastic--there's no complaint there, but the story was awful. I felt as if Nabokov wrote this book with certain morbid goals in mind and I think that that was clear. The breaks came on, for me, about a third of the way through...everything came across as regurgitated. The chase scene never ends. I won't drag this out; it just didn’t do for me."
5,Eneida,1616,1615,"Read it many years ago, in Portuguese. Not too crazy about it, like most people who read it."
5,Fatima,1617,1616,"Probably one of the most over romanticized books I have ever read. Great prose, but I could hardly get through it. The only character I liked was Lolita. Nabokov is a good writer, and I think I'd probably rad something else of his."
5,Vlad,1621,1620,Artful pedagogic pompous ramble perfectly read in the voice of Jeremy Irons.
5,Miranda Hency,1630,1629,"While I appreciate the idea of this book, I could never really get into it. The complete unreliability of the narrator really threw me off. I can enjoy some unreliable narrators, but I feel like I never knew what was real and what wasn't in this novel which left me frustrated. I liked Nabokov's afterword more than the novel itself. I was really excited to read this since it's apparently so exceptionally literary, but I just didn't like it, which makes me very sad because I really wanted to like it."
5,Yara,1631,1630,كتاب مؤلم و حزين و جريئ لكن بصورة مقززة 
5,Jennifer Trudgeon,1632,1631,"I get upset whenever I think about this book. It was extremely hard to read, not to mention the distrubing story line. Do not get tricked into thinking this is a ""love story."" Would not recommend this book to anyone."
5,Jaqui Vallina,1633,1632,This book. Was weird.
5,Hoang-Anh,1634,1633,"it would be unfair to a book if i give any comments on it when i haven't even finished it yet, but still i have to say something about it as i was spending more than one year to read. right from the moment i bought the book i know there could only 2 scenarios to play: i would love this book so much, or hate it so much. I have just read half of the book, which has evidently proved one thing: i (kinda) hate it. i despite the main character, i hate Lolita also, even though i know there, well, must be some deep meaning behind the lines, and though the way Nabokov depicts and describes things is incredibly graceful and sophisticated. well, meh."
5,Adriana,1636,1635,Ugh! I don't ever want to read this again!
5,Merrill McDermott,1638,1637,"As much as the language was beautiful and it exuded extreme literary talent, I simply could not find the patience to withstand the character's own insanity and wait for it all to come to an end. It is an incredibly fascinating portrayal of sick man with a fetish who we can almost even sympathize with, but it's sauciness goes into a decline almost midway through the storyline. Overall, I can appreciate, but not one of my favorites."
5,Penny,1640,1639,Uggggh
5,Jade ,1641,1640,"I picked up Lolita because it's considered a classic, but I had to put it down when the 13 year old's mom is indirectly killed by her deranged middle-aged stepfather (who only married Lolita's mother in the first place because he was obsessively in love with her pubescent daughter). Two stars because I cannot deny ""Lolita"" is extraordinarily well written, even if its pedophilic content disturbed me."
5,Eleanor Connelly,1643,1642,"After hearing all the references to Lolita, the book took me by surprise. It is creepy. A young girl is taken advantage of by an adult yet the Lolita reference has always made the young girl out to be the promiscuous one. Reading the book certainly changed my vantage point."
5,Nicki,1644,1643,"I didn't actually finish the book, the language just got far too tedious, and the story was too slow - and as it was clear where it was heading, I really didn't want to drag out the reading of it any longer than necessary."
5,Malachy,1649,1648,Another entry in the realm of modern classics that simply disappoints. Much too long also. 
5,Heather Lewin,1651,1650,"I only gave this book 2 stars because I think it is written well. Otherwise, I had to force myself to finish this book. It was disturbing, boring, a tad confusing, and drawn out. "
5,Naomi Bradford,1662,1661,"As Nabokov points out, this book is not didactic in any way (which I'm not really a fan of myself). However, lacking that or any other elements -- save its marvelous prose-- Lolita fell flat for me. There is nothing to be gained in reading this book."
5,Alessandro,1665,1664,"BRUTAL. Wise people will tell you of the dangers of self-indulgence and self-justification. This book SHOWS it to you. At least, this is what I got out of the book. However, Vladimir Nabokov would tell you that he had no such lesson in mind and the whole point of the book is literary greatness. WHAT A KILLJOY! "
5,Jacob G,1667,1666,"I'll keep this brief. I have tried on multiple occasions to finish this book, it is impossible. The narrator just isn't interesting and the prose is so dense that when something disturbing finally happens I can't understand it. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe if I give it another shot I'll finally get it, maybe."
5,Kayla Barton,1668,1667,What did I just read?? Why is this in a list of must read books and why is it critically acclaimed? Sick premise and sick story. Not funny.
5,Lily,1671,1670,"Well played, Nabokov. Seems to me that Lolita is an excellent hoax created by a member of the literati for the literati. Nabokov effectively wrote a dreadfully boring and unnecessarily verbose ""erotic"" novel, mixing in enough fancy vocabulary and literary references to prove he's a smart cookie, and that extra dash of pedophilia/""incest"" to make it impossible to dislike the book without seeming dense and prudish.Welp, guess I'm just a Puritan blockhead. In the afterword to this edition, Nabokov makes a stink about people attempting to ""interpret"" the work, and also seems disgruntled with silly readers who, looking to be titillated, find themselves bored in the middle. If a book does not have a theme, an idea, even a character to think about, and it doesn't entertain, then it is utterly without point. Which seems to be the ""point"" of Lolita--to be without point. To be honest, I was told to read this book solely for the beautiful language, and for the first 20 pages or so, I did derive satisfaction from Nabokov's mastery of English. However, as the novel continues, the language grows muddy, the references and obscure words less illuminating to Humbert's unusual mind and more a reinforcement that nothing has changed--the book is still talking about a little girl getting raped in motels. Unbearably disgusting, painful, and boring, all at once. Grand.The one thing that saves this book from the one-star category is the ending. Anyone who has eaten a Warhead candy will know why. Warheads start off very, very sour, but then the sour wears off and the sweet that is left tastes exceptionally good. Lolita was like that--Humbert's entitlement, selfishness, and depravity are unbearable and spin out for hundreds of pages. But then, in a flash, he has a revelation--that he raped Dolores for years, completely depriving her of her childhood. Reading him admitting this crime is a breath of fresh air and almost makes it worth slogging through the rest.But I wouldn't really recommend it."
5,Gregg,1672,1671,"The problem with this book: I already saw the Kubrick film. Thus it was impossible to not see James Mason when reading Humbert's somewhat laborious philosophizing of his own pedophilism, and it was impossible not to look for hints of Peter Sellers lurking in the background as Clare Quilty. The whole novel seems, to my jaded eye, much less controversial in today's climate, what with the Catholic priests' scandals, Spitzer's call girl and teenaged Dionysianism cavorting through the front pages and the halls of the average high school. So maybe I shouldn't have bothered with this one. But it's such a pop culture reference, I wasn't sure whether Humbert was supposed to be a sympathetic character, or a mesmerizing, seductive one: a middle-aged man in love with a twelve-year-old and stealing her life while remaining a slave to his own desire for her. Hmm. Tough one. I vote seductive. "
5,Danielle Jacobs,1674,1673,"This story intrigued me more because of what I heard how fucked up it was, and it was.the writing style is very well done and some how romanticized pedophilia, but in the end got so boring half way through that i couldnt manage to finish it."

I don't think the book triggers sympathy nor disgust just a peek into the mans head. I will finish this book just don't know how long.
5,Anh,1684,1683,I can't disagree that Nabokov is a great writer; but I also can't get over the whole subject matter. It's a dilemma like the whole Polanski thing. 
5,Soluus,1685,1684,"2.5 out of 5. The style was excellent, flowery, if not painfully pretentious (but that was the intention, I assume, and a condition of the protagonist's (antagonist's?) psyche) so merit goes there. I simply, however, felt extremely uncomfortable with the base concept of the novel. I don't really see it as odd for an older man to be attracted to young females -- just Humbert's blatant perversions and his depraved observations of young girls made my skin crawl.Sounds like he has borderline personality disorder to me."

5,Tabbitha Lindsley,1696,1695,"According to Vanity Fair this book is, ""The only convincing love story of our century."" I completely disagree with this. This isn't a love story but a book about a pedophile that becomes obsessed with one young girl. Humbert has a twisted way of thinking about love and considers how he feels toward this young Lolita to be love when it in fact is not.This was one of the most disturbing books I have ever read and really don't understand how someone can call it a love story, especially not the only convincing love story. If one is looking at it from the point of view of Humbert then yes it is a sick love story but in terms of the book overall it is not. Okay, I can see how some might say it is love in its cruelest or most vile form in terms of madness or his hallucination that what he feels is actually love when its all delusion. This was interesting in terms of perhaps getting inside the mind of a pedophile and seeing how they may twist relationship with a child and call it love but even that is stretching it. This book was just okay and I really don't recommend it. "
5,Ginny,1697,1696,"No matter how gifted Nabokov is, and he is, sex with minors is bad business always!"

5,Michael Tarpinian,1701,1700,"What a scumbag. Not since Rabbit Run have I encountered a book with no redeeming characters. Reminds me of the writing of Camus, the Catcher in the Rye, or Miss Lonelyhearts. These emotionally disturbed admittedly self-involved people hurt or destroy other people in their wake. Why can't we just call their actions sin?should a book like this be a banned? No but perhaps it should just be ignored."
5,Julia Southwick,1702,1701,I really did try. The writing was beautiful but.........no. Just too icky.

5,Kay Lee,1704,1703,"I don't particularly know why it took me so long to read this book. An ambitious topic tackled by Mr. Nabokov, however I found the novel to be just ""okay"". At times it was quite humorous and there were several beautiful passages, however I felt that the obsession of Lolita started to become monotonous. The descriptions lost their luster and the sentences became long-winded. Perhaps this is the reason why I dislike Charles Dickens. Oh and it comes in handy if you know some French as Nabokov likes to interpolate random phrases into the text. (Although I don't think that added any dimension or character, but that is debatable). "

5,Kai Crawford,1709,1708,"Humorous at times. Humbert Humbert's narrative is intellectually challenging. I was reluctantly charmed by the plethora of literary allusions (most of which I couldn't even begin to comprehend). Filled with juxtaposition of beautiful language and disturbing deeds.(A descriptive passage):""By a paradox of pictorial thought, the average lowland North-American countryside had at first seemed to me something I accepted with a shock of amused recognition because of those painted oilclothes which were imported from America in the old days to be hung above washstands in Central-European nurseries, and which fascinated a drowsy child at bed time with the rustic green views theydepicted opaque curly trees, a barn, cattle, a brook, the dull white of vague orchards in bloom,and perhaps a stone fence or hills of greenish gouache. But gradually the models of thoseelementary rusticities became stranger and stranger to the eye, the nearer I came to know them.Beyond the tilled plain, beyond the toy roofs, there would be a slow suffusion of inutileloveliness, a low sun in a platinum haze with a warm, peeled-peach tinge pervading the upperedge of a two-dimensional, dove-gray cloud fusing with the distant amorous mist. There mightbe a line of spaced trees silhouetted against the horizon, and hot still noons above a wildernessof clover, and Claude Lorrain clouds inscribed remotely into misty azure with only their cumuluspart conspicuous against the neutral swoon of the background. Or again, it might be a stern ElGreco horizon, pregnant with inky rain, and a passing glimpse of some mummy-necked farmer,and all around alternating strips of quick-silverish water and harsh green corn, the wholearrangement opening like a fan, somewhere in Kansas."""
5,Adam Chawansky,1717,1716,"This book started off intriguing, as it was clearly a first person account of his folly and foibles around a young girl dubbed Lolita. However, as the story dragged on, I found the story increasing dull. One, it uses a lot of French wordplay and literary allusions I didn't understand. Two, not much happens. For long stretches of the story you're exposed to a laundry list of places the characters visited without any real plot development. Three, by the time I was around 75% of the way through the book, I just didn't care what happened to Humbert or Lolita anymore."
5,Erskine,1719,1718,"I confess I did not finish this book. It creeped me out too much, so I put it down half way through. The writing was good, but I could not enjoy it. "
5,Dave Schumacher,1720,1719,"While a brilliant writer with beautiful and often funny prose, I found Lolita to be a rather tedious read. Maybe this was done purposely to paint an accurate picture of bizarre mind of Humbert, but I didn't need 300+ pages to get this point across "
5,Jennifer Madden,1721,1720,I think this was a two star when I read it. It is a disgusting story with fantastic writing. You can get into Humberts mind and understand how he thinks. Still not good enough to be considered a classic must read.
5,Shannah,1722,1721,I think I wanted to like this one more than I actually did. I am very glad I read it though.

Dull, But Not Without Redeeming Features
It took me two years to power my way through this one. I'm a stubborn reader that doesn't like to leave things half-read - but believe me it was reading for grim determination rather than pleasure from about the first third onwards.My heart sank when it then appeared on my uni reading lists and I had to go through the bugger again, but reading it again has given me a slightly higher appreciation of it.There are some powerful descriptions, some beautiful turns of phrase, not to mention the uncomfortable subject matter is what good literature should be tackling - showing things from unusual perspectives and humanising the monster.My problem starts when dear Humbert Humbert goes on the road, and just starts listing hotels and the most uninteresting details for hours at a stretch. At my university they argued that this was a deliberate move by Nabokov to demonstrate something about the narrator. Knowing Nabokov it probably was, but it still lost me - and putting your audience off is not a good move as far as I'm concerned.Plus the wet fart of an ending. I know dramatic things happened, but by that point it felt like we were watching the action through a spyglass. Somehow, when the plot gets the most dramatic, it all feels bizarrely removed.Again, I'm sure Nabokov meant it that way, and I'm sure it's terribly clever, but beyond the opening lines of the first chapter, it bored me to tears."
5,Dottie ,1726,1725,It didn't get me raving. It didn't make me love Nabokov. It was fine -- I just didn't really get enthused.
5,Effy Weasley,1727,1726,"'i would like to describe her face, her ways - and i cannot, because my own desire for her blinds me when she is near.'disturbing and disgusting book - i feel kinda dirty after reading it.a lot of reviews say that it's a book that makes you feel bad for h.h. or sympathize with him but in my opinion that's not the case at all. i don't know what kind of book those people read but how can you ever sympathize with h.h.?those people say that he really loved lolita and what not but that's not true at all. it wasn't love. it was lust and that's all there ever was. he admits at some point that they didn't talk very much and that most of the time he didn't knew what was going through her head, what she liked etc. he wasn't a loving partner who is interested in every little detail about his girlfriend. no, he was just a paedophile interested in fucking a 12-year-old. the writing was hard to understand. half of the time i had no idea what the hell he was talking about. the book is filled with pointless descriptions - descriptions of things i didn't understand why he was describing them at all. h.h. seems a bit confused, he was just rambling on and on, throwing some french expressions into it (which i didn't understand either so another 5% of the book i didn't understand...), decribing everything at once and nothing at all.the story itself is rather boring - after lolita's mother dies they spent over a year on a road trip through america where it's always just h.h. drooling over lolita's legs or her skin or her smell or some sort of that. other than that nothing happens and it gets boring rather quickly. the character of h.h. himself is rather boring as well. he thinks of himself as this educated, well-read, good-looking gentleman when it's far more realistic that he looks something like george costanza. that's how i picture him anyhow. lolita is also a character without any depth. i get that she's just 12/13 years old but still the author could have given her a little more character than the stereotypical sulky and whiny teenager with interest in movie stars and magazines about them.the circumstances of lolita's disappearance and her resurfacing are also confusing and somehow hard to believe. she said that h.h. was raping her but then she runs away with another 40-something peadophile? and then she's suddenly married and pregnant with 17? it's just all very unreal... all in all, not as great a book as everyone makes it out to be. i don't know why it's become such a classic. it's not like there weren't people before nabokov writing about sex with children and those were far more graphic than lolita so i don't really get all the fuss about this book. definitely not worth the time. "
5,Zhanna,1729,1728,"If I had to rate this book on its writing, it would've been comparable to my top reviews. As my view of the book is too strongly influenced by its theme, I'm ranking it at the bottom. Know what you're getting into before starting this book. "
5,chucklesthescot,1730,1729,"Humbert has an unhealthy interest in young girls and when he goes to spend a summer in Ramsdale, he becomes obsessed with his landlady's young daughter Dolores. Dolores is happy to play with his affection when it suits her but has no idea that Humbert is in love with her. Humbert is forced to marry her mother Charlotte to stay in contact with the girl but a tragic accident will hand Humbert a chance to seduce his love.  I love the Jeremy Irons film and it was certainly closely based on the novel, unlike the original film. This book though was a bit of a long-winded waffle in that over-descriptive style that I just don't enjoy. There were some sections of good plot and flashes of humour, and parts of it were well written. I just got bored with the waffle in between."
5,Joshua Belice,1731,1730,"Not the easiest read, especially if you're not fond of the incest topic."
5,Julie Sikorski,1733,1732,Disturbing.
5,Amar,1735,1734,"Written in first-person perspective this is the story of a man's obsession (he would call it love) with a 12 year-old girl and of his various machinations for the continuous sexual abuse that ensues.At first I was shocked and repulsed by the subject matter and, in particular, by Humbert Humbert's detailed and explicit description of his desire for young girls. I trudged on, however, never entirely coming to terms with listening in on a pedophile's inner thoughts but finding nonetheless certain parts and aspects of the book enjoyable. Unfortunately, these, for me, were few and far between and were vastly overshadowed by the tediousness of the writing. Subject matter aside, I would find it hard to ever pick up another Nabokov book."
5,Bonnie Bryan,1736,1735,"I find the subject matter repulsive and the writing self indulgent, but I have to finish it!! "

5,Caffers,1740,1739,"I felt compelled to read the first half or so of the book. But by the latter part, I grew tired of Humbert Humbert. He had no redeeming qualities whatsoever; he was just creepy.I did enjoy the author's light writing style. "
5,Amanda Joyce,1741,1740,"May need to read this again as (honestly) I don't really see what the big deal is. Perhaps I just couldn't get over the high 'ick' factor. Lolita is an abused, selfish child and Mr. HH is not a psychologically well man. Perhaps that is the whole point...but...at the end of the day...it didn't knock my socks off. "
5,Theresa ,1743,1742,"After only two discs, I felt dirty. This one is a DNF."
5,Laura B.,1745,1744,"Ok, al personaje lo pueden tildar de pedófilo, pero la lolita no era ninguna santita..."
5,Brian Harris,1746,1745,"Book was good, just maybe at the wrong stage in life to enjoy..."
5,Michael Davis,1748,1747,"Since Nabokov insists there is no moral to the story, and that ""a work of fiction only exists insofar as it affords... aesthetic bliss, that is a sense of being somehow, somewhere, connected with other states of being where art... is the norm,"" I feel obligated to critique it on a purely aesthetic level. The wordplay is undoubtedly clever and afforded a good deal of amusement for the first 100 pages or so. By the time HH and Lolita hit the road, I was bored out of my mind. The book in its entirety is about as thrilling as 'Symphony in Yellow' by Oscar Wilde. Speaking of Wilde, 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' accomplishes Nabokov's ideal of good fiction without suffering the reader hundreds of pages of veiled descriptions of a pedophile groping his stepdaughter. The end, and the blessed new plot developments it brought with it, afforded my aftertaste of the book some of its new cleverness, but it didn't veil the repetitive nature of the story and the language that was meant to carry the entire narrative.Modern Library ranked 'Lolita' the #4 greatest novel ever written in the English language, and my girlfriend, a brilliant critic herself, would place it at #1. I don't think I'll ever see what they do in A Book Entitled Lolita."
5,Imas,1751,1750,"Alasan membaca buku ini karena penghargaan yang diterima, walaupun themanya bukan buku yang biasa aku baca. Tapi nampak nya terjemahannya kurang cucok untukku, mungkin bisa membedakan penilaian walaupun aku yakin ngga bakal jadi favorit juga.Novel Lolita dosebut-sebut sebagai mahakarya Vladimir Nobakov (1899-1977), penulis kelahiran Rusia yang menetap di Amerika Serikat. Lolita telah diakui sebagai salah satu karya sastra klasik dunia,namun sempat dilarang beredar karena dianggap tidak senonoh dan melanggar standar moral masyarakat pada zaman ituLolita merupakan memoar seorang profesor bernama Humbert Humbert yang menuliskan petualangan cintanya bersama Lolita. Begitulah, lika-liku kisah cinta terlarang seorang pria dewasa dan gadis kecil yang merupakan anak tirinya sendiri. Ceritanya cukup bikin mules dan mual."
5,Christin Rivera,1753,1752,I could not finish this book. I understand it is a classic. The story line was if interest and the writing is superb. But I just found myself dreading the that's 100 pages. I will get through it at some point. 
5,Richard Anthony,1754,1753,"Without doubt well written, however an decent understanding of French would be of benefit; great for lexiophiles, not necessarily great for the soul. This a book with no redeeming or redeemable characters, and as such, it is not a pleasant read, which as I understand it was part of the authors plan. "
5,Devyn Duffy,1756,1755,"Especially NOT recommended for survivors of sexual abuse.This book is horrifying, and the protagonist couldn't have been more loathsome if he had been written by D.H. Lawrence and portrayed by Jerry Sandusky. For a while I thought that Nabokov had written the story to scare people into realizing the depth of evil that surrounds us, but in an afterword he claims that he actually wrote the story because he felt like writing it.The story is not a love story in the slightest. It has nothing but rape, molestation, psychological torture, and sociopathy, all serving no purpose.If this book hadn't been widely regarded as an essential classic, I'd have stopped reading within the first 20 pages. There is nothing beautiful or meaningful about this book; it is just awful, awful, awful."
5,Lily M. Lopez,1762,1761,"Estoy segura que no todos los pedófilos son iguales, pero es interesante tener un atisbo de lo que podría ser la mente de uno de ellos. Bastante obsesivo Humbert Humbert, de doble moral, acusando a otros de sus mismos pecados. El personaje de Lolita no me terminó de agradar, pero hubo momentos en los que sentí mucha pena por ella. Al fin y al cabo, libido y todo, era una niña. Entiendo por qué el libro escandalizó en su momento; si bien no es explícito, sí se sobreentiende el contenido sexual del mismo. El final me resultó un poco simple, pero igual fue una buena lectura."
5,Helena Duque,1765,1764,"[PT]""Lolita"" tem uma linha de história cativante - um romance entre um homem adulto e uma pequena de treze anos que aifnal andava a usá-lo (ela andava a usá-lo a ele, rapariga inteligente!) para ficar com outro, tão velho como o próprio protagonista da história. No entanto, a sua escrita e a sua desenvoltura não foram suficientes para eu gostar da história - as longas descrições, a obsessão de Humbert e o enfado com que via o mundo à sua volta (apenas o mundo à sua volta porque o ""seu"" mundo era Lolita e essa de enfadonha nada tinha!) foram as situações que me afastaram do encanto do livro. Admito que Nabokov é um excelente escritor, rigoroso e inteligente mas, pessoalmente (e podem-me considerar o que vós bem entenderdes), isso não é tudo. Para um livro ser bom, na minha prespectiva, precisa de ser cativante, viciante, ficar a querer lê-lo até às quatro da madrugada quando tenho compromissos às oito da manhã, é querer ler mas ficar com pena quando chego ao fim, é relê-lo quatro e cinco vezes e, mesmo assim, achar aquele livro um bom amigo - e isso não aconteceu com esta história."
5,Ephrem,1770,1769,"Good reads rating scale describe 2 stars as ""It was OK."" That's just how i felt about the book after finishing it."
5,Brainarchy,1771,1770,"My rating's justification: the story - one star; the writing technique - three stars. Unless you are the one and the only Marquis de Sade, even if you are Vladimir Nabokov, do not write such a horror-disgusting book!"
5,Bryant,1773,1772,I will read Nabokov no more forever.
5,Diane Gihring,1775,1774,"I think this is an interesting book to discuss in the context of Post-Modernism and the role of the narrator. I read this for grad school and the major question we discussed is whether or not the narrator is telling us the truth or is he presenting ""his"" truth to us, or is her purposefully misleading the reader. When I had that question to ponder when I was reading, then I became more interested in the book.Before the 20th century, the reader trusted the narrator implicity, but with all of the experiementation of Modernism and then the total distrust of all things during Post-Modernism, we can no longer trust the narrator implicitly to tell us the truth.But the subject matter is on the creepy side, an old man attracted to a young teen, and manipulating the situation so that they can be together. He plays mind games with her, molding her to be what he wants her to be. She manipulates him too.Definitely not a fun, feel good novel!If you are serious about the literary process, Post-Modernism, psychological mind games, then this book might be for you.And of course Sting mentions the author, Nabokov, in his song ""Don't stand so close to me"" so it is good to get the context of that line :)."
5,Camille McCarthy,1777,1776,"A very well-written piece of trash, in my opinion. I was really grossed out by a lot of the descriptions and just the thought that he wrote this made me want to throw up. There were a lot of puns and the descriptions were full of clever wordplay but in the end the book wasn't even that exciting. The plot was pretty boring, really, after the first half when he is on his first trip around the US staying at motels with Lolita. After that it became pretty flat and even the climax at the end was so boring I almost fell asleep reading it. I don't understand how people can say this book is about love, because first off he treats Lolita like an object, not a real person with feelings, and second she hates him! Even the main character, Humbert Humbert, admits he ruined her childhood. It is not about love, it is about the disgusting sick urges of an entitled man who uses everyone around him to get what he wants. I quite enjoyed ""Pnin"" much more than this book, because the plot was engaging, the language was clever and full of puns, and the characters were interesting. It is sad that ""Lolita"" is Nabokov's most well-known work because it is not even very good compared to his other works. "
5,Yasmin,1778,1777,My heart was a hysterical unreliable organ.
5,Leila,1780,1779,Obviously I've been expecting too much from this book - since I wasn't very thrilled while reading it or when I finished it. 
5,Kendall,1785,1784,"2.5 stars. I thought it was a cop out that Lolita herself was so dislikable, and the big reveal at the end felt pretty meaningless because the other character featured in the denouement had made no impression on me earlier in the book."
5,Mariana,1786,1785,after it climaxed (pun intended) it fell short (pun intended). 
5,Adina Nita,1789,1788,"Very interesting book, so different from the other books I have read before. You end up feeling sorry for Humbert, because despite his efforts to make Lolita falling for him, he is rejected."
5,Angelica,1792,1791,"This book is very hard to give a review to. Although i love creepy and twisted plots in novels, i felt like the way this story was told could have been more powerful in a different way. The vocabulary Vladimir used in this novel was too distracting and took away from my reading experience. This book may have been a little to advanced for my liking. However, i still believe this book has potential in my future, i do want to re read it and put more effort in understand some of Humbert's explanations fro being so obsessive over nymphets, more specifically Lolita. "
5,Nelleke,1795,1794,"Ik kan me voorstellen dat dit boek het een en ander aan ophef had veroorzaakt toen het in de jaren 50 werd uitgebracht. Maar een boek over een controversieel onderwerp hoeft nog niet meteen een goed boek te zijn, ook al staat het vol met literaire hoogstaande zinnen. Bij het lezen van het voorwoord van Joost Zwagerman en Rudy Kousbroek had ik het al kunnen weten dat dit niet mijn type boek was. Dat zijn namelijk niet mijn type schrijvers. En dit boek is gewoon niet mijn type boek"
5,Kas Garza,1798,1797,"okay, so I stopped reading 20 thousand leagues under the sea (again) because I just can't even (don't tell Clint I said that.)I am now reading Lolita and almost done with it. Now that I've got a blog, I realize I should probably make more time to read. BUT I'M SO BUSY. "

5,Georgina Taylor,1803,1802,"I didn't really enjoy this book, since I found the writing and metaphors that Nabokov had used very advanced and difficult. This book was definitely a stretch book. I choose it since I had heard a lot about it and it sounded interesting."
5,catalina,1804,1803,starts out good. the main character is neurotic and you have a natural drive to find out just how perverted and sicko he is...but then it takes way too long--and the character gets irritating. Never finished this book--if it don't provide put it to the side. 
5,Stephanie Adams,1806,1805,"An interesting book, but way to disturbing."
5,Bindu,1809,1808,the description and the story told from the point of view of a ... [finding it difficult to get the right word!!] is good.

5,Laurie Frazier,1816,1815,"Had to read for college - not my favorite, although intriguing."
5,Jesse,1825,1824,"You'll hear everyone else say this. That whole ""The subject was awful but it was so beautifully written."" I tend to agree. But was it a good book?Not so much. If you're looking to read something that makes you feel good, or something that expands your mind, or something that leaves you thinking, then find something else. I was impressed by the prose and have a lot of respect for the man who wrote it, I suppose, but I guess I don't get *why.*I've come to the conclusion that had anyone else written it, or had this not been written as lovingly as it was, then the reviews would plummet. It'd be ""just a story about some self-hating pedophile.""So if I can write a story about someone engaged in a romantic relationship with a tortoise, will it be accepted as long as I write it awesomely? Get outta here.Overall this book had its moments, but in the end it left a bad taste in my mouth. I didn't feel like I'd grown, or that I'd learned something. I didn't even feel ""more cultured"" or whatever because it was a book that everyone else read. I just felt kinda relieved that it was over."
5,Maťa,1826,1825,"2,5/5Začiatok (povedzme necelých sto strán) bol úplne skvelý. Posledných cca 70 strán bolo fajn. Zvyšok bola nuda. Lolita mi liezla na nervy, ale Humbert ešte niekoľkonásobne viac. Proste časom ma strašne štval. Už len kvôli tej jeho príšernej žiarlivosti. Pozitívom je ale to, že autor píše naozaj veľmi dobre (čo ale nestačí), aj keď som sa miestami strácala. Je to ale škoda, do tejto knihy som vkladala obrovské nádeje, bola som na ňu naozaj zvedavá. "

5,Sashiko,1830,1829,"The book sounded great in theory. It was recommended to me by a friend whose tastes are as dark and perverse as mine can be. But it was a huge disappointment. It's written well but the pace of the plot is incredibly slow. Humbert is a really boring person, despite not being quite normal."
5,erin,1831,1830,"I felt like I needed to read Lolita before I started ""Reading Lolita in Tehran,"" but I just couldn't stomach it. Nabokov is an amazing writer (that's why two stars instead of one), and I'd like to read something else by him, but this book grossed me out too much to finish. I might have been able to read it when I was younger, before I'd thought much about the harm of societal and individual sexualization of young girls or worked closely with victims of people like Humbert, but at this point in my life it's not worth the time.

5,Man O'neal,1847,1846,"WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS: For me this book started off very good. It was compelling, engaging and sprinkled with patches of beautiful language here and there. It's about a middle aged man (Humbert) who is controleld by an obessesive lust for pre pubescent girls. When he first lays eyes on the young Dolores Haze ,whom he names Lolita, this passionate yearning which has always perculated inside him becomes too much to ignore; he must have her. But under the watchful eye of Mrs. Haze and a close knit suburban community this is no easy task. The operation requires great tact and subtlety. Now, the story of this operation and it's development is wonderful. I enjoyed every page of it anticipating Humbert's next move and his eventual capture of the enchanting ""nymphet"". Sadly, once the seduction was complete and Humbert had claimed his victory about half way through, the book took a serious turn for the worse. It dragged on with boring recounts of mundane events and became difficult for me to follow as an uninterested reader. In short, once he makes Lolita his lover nothing even close to the gripping awfulness of quiet pedophilia occurs for the second part of Nabokov's story."
