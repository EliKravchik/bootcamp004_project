0,John Nelson,"Wow! What a hell of a way to quit drinking, Rachel!I'm giving this a four stars. Not because the quality of the story deserves it (quite silly, childish and almost generic. More like a two stars). I'm giving it a four star because it was hella fun to read. It was exciting, in that high school drama sort of way. What a bunch of pathetic losers they all were. None of this would have happened if there was one responsible, emotionally mature person in the group. However I loved this in the same way I loved Braodchurch. Grim, lost...memories of better times and twists. Who cares if it's like Gone Girl. I never read it and I don't care too. This one is British :)Why I find even more hilarious is how the people who give this a one star write enormous reviews; about as long as the book. The way I see it: you're not fooling any one with long winded reviews. You read the damn book, and now you feel like you've cheated your sense of pretentious intellect by doing so. So you have to write an entire essay explaining why you think it sucks, and why you're so smart. Well, you seem stupid caring much. How about a ""fuck this book, this book sucks"" and leave it at that? "
1,Adrianne,"People have compared this book to Gone Girl... but I beg to differ.I give this 4 stars. It was quite good , It had so many twist and turns that I was not able to guess who the killer was until it got to that point. It's hard to say that it was a good thing because well, it's good that I and probably a lot of people were not able to guess the ending but it had so many twists that I felt like it was purposely overloaded with all of that junk to mask the revelation at the end which sometimes I felt was unnecessary. I love how she gave the 3 readers three voices that really helped paint a picture of what was happening and kept us on the loop as to what the other relevant characters where thinking, what happened on their side ,make us root and accuse one person based on what was currently happening in the story.The only similar thing about this and gone girl is this: Someone goes missing, someone will get blamed and the missing someone is a victim.. BUT not really.It did kept me intrigued and helped me out of my 2 year reading slump. I felt bad for the characters it felt dark but exciting. it's the kind of book that makes me want to grab my kindle every chance I got just to know what happens next. Overall I thought she still did a great job. Definitely worth reading. "
2,Annabel,"I really enjoyed this novel - a true thriller that had me gripped throughout. I appreciated all of the characters, and (despite what other reviewers say) they were believable and relatable. The plot and the protagonist were original and the narrative voice of Rachel really kept me engaged and kept the pace going. I loved the plot twist at the end (although I found the final couple of pages a bit anti-climactic).Any thriller fan will enjoy this - it hasn't got a ton of action but it is gripping and engaging. "
3,Leah,This is one of those books that I felt a little sad seeing end. I just know whatever comes on its heels will pale in comparison. 
4,The Just-About-Average Ms M,"I have no idea why I am bothering to leave a review for a book that already has more than 14,000 reviews on Amazon—surely enough folks have left their opinions by now so that mine is irrelevant. But still…First off, I wonder about the title, when the rider on the train left her girlhood behind her quite some time ago, and is now a thirtyish, pudgy, lank-haired and utterly forgettable and serious alcoholic. Perhaps “The Drunk on the Train” or even “The Woman on the Train” does not have the same resonance, and certainly loses the subliminal tie-in to “Gone Girl” that so many people have gone on and on about. So we have a girl on the train. Very well.Many reviews track the plot very thoroughly, so go read those for the storyline. I’m going to share my thoughts primarily about the characters, and then the story arc as a whole. For those of you in my august age group who remember Hitchcock’s “Rear Window,” and the much more youthful ones who saw “Disturbia,” I think you’ll agree that the characters in both movies who were such voyeurs and did some risky things were at least likeable, and we cheered for them to succeed against the bad guys. I did not like the characters in this book, none of them, female or male. I thought whatever they did to be supremely idiotic, and found myself hoping they would meet a Very Bad End…and soon. And yet, I kept reading, tapping those Kindle pages, one right after the other.Rachel’s appalling alcoholism, her weaknesses and bargain-basement self-esteem led to her riding the train in the first place to a job that no longer existed because of her drinking. She fantasized about a couple whose terrace she saw from her train window, and whose house was five doors down from the one she had shared with her ex-husband. Her life was the pits, so this couple must have everything she did not, and that everything must be perfect. Almost everything Rachel thought, everything she did from this point on was a frustrating mix of clichés, of stereotyping, of improbability, and just plain nuts. I wanted to slap her about every ten pages or so, jerk some sense into her, and simply not care when she backed herself into a dangerous corner.Megan the unhappy wife with a past—where have we met this character before, and how many times? She who was to be Rachel’s perfect substitute was not, and her story, which we get in installments, had not the slightest hint of novelty in it, and therefore not much of interest. I didn’t want to slap her for the predictable choices she made, but she did make me yawn quite a bit.Anna was the worst of the three—self-satisfied mistress to Rachel’s husband, and now his wife. She reproduced and became a boring, insufferable Earth Mother who drinks lattes, does Pilates, and whines a great deal. I loathed her, and wanted something dreadful to happen to her. Quickly.The less said about the two men—Tom, Rachel’s former husband and Anna’s present one, and Scott, Megan’s husband and Rachel’s Mr. Perfect—the better. Not only are they walking talking clichés but also the nearly fanatical focus of the three female protagonists. Even now, I fail to understand why. They were stupid, abusive, superficially charming, and as three-dimensional as cardboard. They did not improve one iota from first to last, in my opinion.So, in light of characters I thought were almost impossible to like, or for whom I couldn’t muster the slightest empathy, why did I bother? Why should you bother? Because in spite of the faults, the reckless actions, the out of character behavior, Anna’s incessant whining and Rachel’s non-stop drinking, and even the almost but not quite predictable denouement, I forgot all my irritations at the end…well, almost all. Somehow the book came together then, not particularly tidy, or necessarily conventional, but oddly in line with the generally messiness of the plot and its characters. At the end I cared about Rachel, and Anna, although I would still like to slap her. At the end I was glad I read the book, even as I cussed as I was reading it.Someone—or several someones, actually—said this is a good beach book, and it is. A good book for a rainy evening with a glass or two of wine, or a long commute, especially on a train. Certainly not great literature, or a great example of the genre, but worth the read, I believe. Sometimes it’s fun to talk back to characters."
5,Burak,Her şeye rağmen güzeldi. Sevdim gerçekten.
6,Jessica K," I gave it four stars because it was an original story and kept my attention. Like the main character, Rachel, I was an observer from the distance that got completely sucked into the lives of characters in this novel. Even though I wasn't enjoying the storyline and where it was taking me, I still had to keep reading to find out what happened. In my opinion, kudos to this debut author in creating a story that may not be an enjoyable read but still caused the reader to keep reading to get some resolution at the end.  I don't want to go into too much details on the plot- because this is a story in which a lot hangs on the details. Rachel, train rider and observer of life, spends her days speculating and creating a world with the people she views from the window of her carriage on the day. When she watches an altercation involving two individuals she watches on a daily basis- her imaginary world is shaken. It is completely turned upside down when she discovers one of the individuals has disappeared. The book is really the voices of three characters as Hawkins chronicles the events of a disappearance, alcoholism, fall out from divorce, adultery, and pure psychological angst.  It wasn't a favorite of mine. I think all the hype around it set the bar for my expectations. Overall, I would say give it a try so you can discuss with your friends who more than likely have also read it due to the hype. "
7,Trish,"Read for a book club. One heck of a ride. Every single character is a hot mess. I seriously had no one idea who had done what to whom until the end. By the end I was very glad for my calm, boring life. "
8,Bailey,Fantastically fun thriller - definitely check this one out when it's available.
9,Jayaram Vengayil,"For someone who enjoys peeking into others' lives, this book is a treat. By the time I got to the end, I was as exhausted and hungover as the protagonist. The author writes with the immediacy of a journalist and the diary format works very well for her. Telling the story in multiple first person form, makes for a mosaic of engrossing word pictures leading to a fitting climax. By the time you get to the end, you may wonder if the ride was worthwhile, but then do you really care as long as it was enjoyable?"
10,Amrelsayed,جمال الرواية في إبرازها لرؤيتنا المسبقة للأخرين وكيف نضعهم في إطارات افتراضية ..كيف تخدعنا عواطفنا ..جو الرواية شبيه جدا بفيلم GONE GIRL..ليس فقط لأنها تدور حول اختفاء زوجة و لكن لأننا نكتشف بالتدريج أن الانطباعات الأولي لا تدومالشخصيات الرئيسية تبدو في مرحلة ما صور لنفس الشخصية المنهزمة المستعدة للدفاع عن الحب بأي وسيلة..والكاتبة تعطي المبرر المقبول لكل خطأ حتي القتل..رغم أن الرواية تصنف من نوع الإثارة لكن قدرة الكاتبة في التفتيش العميق في نفوس أبطالها تجعل منها رواية أدبية ذات مستوي رفيع..

12,Guillaume Tribulations d'une vie,"http://tribulationsdunevie.weebly.com...Le voyeurisme ! Même si elle ne l'avouerait pas, c'est l'activité à laquelle s'adonne chaque jour Rachel, depuis le train, lorsqu'elle épie ceux qu'elle a surnommé Jess et Jason dans leur maison. En plus de leur donner des prénoms, elle leur invente également une vie... Sauf qu'un jour Jess, Megan en réalité, disparaît mystérieusement. Rachel, elle, a vu quelque chose... ""La fille du train"" est un thriller de femmes. Ce sont elles qui ont la parole, elles qui mènent l'enquête, qui trahissent, qui mentent, ... La construction de ce roman révèle une certaine complexité qui lui donne cet aspect addictif. 3 femmes témoignent à tour de rôle nous apportant leurs différents points de vue sur l'intrigue. Seulement, elles s'expriment à des moments différents. Il est vraiment indispensable de se fier attentivement aux dates inscrites en début de chapitre. Une fois ce point intégré: la lecture devient un vraie moment de bonheur, impossible de poser le roman. L'auteure a su apporter lentement un suspense qui a un impact puissant et efficace sur le lecteur. Les éléments nous sont apportés au compte gouttes et nous suivons des personnages qui sont tout aussi perdu que nous. Les chemins empruntés par l'intrigue nous conduisent dans des culs de sac, l'auteure joue avec nous tout autant qu'avec ses personnages. Un vrai lien intime, personnel, se crée avec les personnages au fil des chapitres. Un point d'honneur est mis sur l'expression de leurs sentiments les plus profonds. Rapidement on s'attache à eux et on compati à la torture psychologique qu'ils subissent. ""La fille du train"" est aussi un roman émouvant. J'ai passé un excellent moment de lecture avec ce thriller au suspense efficace. Un roman à la construction complexe qui apporte un tout autre intérêt à l'intrigue. "
13,Casey,"First of all: stop with the Gone Girl comparisons! A woman can write a thriller centered around flawed female characters without invoking that title. Personally, I hated Gone Girl, but I thought this was a fascinating thriller.The first few chapters, admittedly, drag. Rachel, deep in the self-indulgent misery of alcoholism, rides the same train to London day in and day out to mimic her old routine. She drinks in public and makes up stories about strangers. Then when one of her familiar subjects goes missing (I guess this is where the Gone Girl stuff comes from, but ignore that), the last stable bit of her life skids away from her. Bring in the new wife of Rachel's former husband, Anna, and the missing woman herself, Megan, and you have the complete cast of flawed, narrators in this twisted story. (Unlike Flynn's writing, Hawkins' characters do have their redeeming qualities, even if you don't necessarily like them.)Once Megan actually goes missing, the novel picks up its pace and deliver on that can't-put-it-down promise. This is just tense enough and tight enough to hit the spot, even if I thought the choice of villain was a bit obvious."
14,Shirley,"I'm sure many people mentioned this already but this book reminded me of ""Gone Girl"" (the movie version, since I haven't read the book!)But the dark, suspenseful feeling you get throughout the storyline while reading the book, made me think of the same feelings I got while watching ""Gone Girl."" And the best parts are the twists in the story! We get three different viewpoints throughout the story, from three different women who are all linked together. Rachel is our main character: divorced, depressed, and drunk for more than half the time she appears in the book. Anne is the new wife of Rachel's ex-husband, who moved into the same house that Rachel had been living with her ex. And Megan is the neighbor a few houses down, who has countless troubles of her own. We have three different viewpoints, but none of them are reliable. You get the feeling that they are all hiding something from you, not revealing the whole truth, or just don't know what's going on (like in Rachel's case since she's drunk for most of the story). And the best part throughout the book was guessing what really happened and piecing together the bits and pieces from each woman's viewpoint to reach the final conclusion. "
15,Arlene Hayman,"It seems that I read ‘Girl on the Train’ recently and forgot to post a review of the novel. Therefore, my dim memories of this novel perhaps do not give it the due respect that it deserves. I do recall that I was tremendously empathetic of Rachel throughout the novel, as I found it profoundly sad that she had lost so much due to her personal problems arising from alcoholism. I really expected Rachel to be a less likeable character, but instead I felt so empathetic towards her and wanted life to work out well for her. I wanted her to overcome her drinking problem, pull herself together, and move on towards a brighter future. Although Rachel would be labeled as an unreliable character, I didn’t find her devious and deceitful like Amy Dunne in Gone Girl. As to the ending, without giving too much away, let me just say that I thought it conveniently ironic that Rachel resolved the whole problem in the back yard with Tom, just as the train was going by. How clever of the author to construct the ending that way!‘Girl on the Train’ was an entrancing novel that will have you riveted to the story from beginning to end; it was just suspenseful enough for me, without being too bizarre or explicitly gruesome."
16,Annette Hall,"A railway line runs past houses and trains regularly stop or slow at a signal. From the front, the houses look impersonal, but from the train the backs look private and personal. The girl on the train, Rachel, is a regular commuter and always looks out, when it stops, to the house where she used to live and the neighbouring house where she often sees a couple in the garden.Rachel’s ex husband, Tom, lives in “her” house with his new wife, Anna, and child. She fantasises about the couple living nearby, seeing them as a perfect, happy couple and calls them Jason and Jess. One day she glimpses something that makes her doubt that view. One day she learns that Jess is Megan, and she has disappeared, later found murdered.The story is about who murdered her, and is written with the voice of the three women; Rachel, Anna and Megan. Could Rachel be responsible? She is depressed and an alcoholic and has black holes in her memory when she is drunk. She frequents the street where she used to live, and has blood on her hands and a bad cut on her head, but can’t remember anything. Megan used to baby sit for Anna, but left suddenly. Anna is fiercely protective of her child, and upset by Rachel’s visits to the street.Other candidates are Scott, Megan’s husband. Supportive and loving, but not aware of Megan’s past, and present secrets. Tom, Anna’s husband, and Rachel’s ex is charming and loving on the surface, but that hides a manipulative and deceitful nature. The other candidate is Megans therapist who might have a reason to wish her ill.We are left wondering throughout the book – who is the killer. We need to read without stopping to see how it ends!I like the way the characters are portrayed. Rachel feels detached from life because of her depression, and unsure whether memories are real or imagined because of her drinking. Megan has a hole in the middle of her soul because of events in the past. It makes her feel restless and unsettled. Anna hates living in the house that was occupied by Rachel, and desperately wants to be happy with Tom and the baby.Babies thread themselves through the book. One much loved and protected, one much loved but accidently killed, one killed before birth, one not conceived – all affecting the story. Death is another theme – death of a father, of a brother, of a daughter –in the past, but all affecting the story, and Megan’s death in the present.A very readable book, full of character and suspense."
17,Deena,Will have you hooked from the start. Glad I got to know what the noise was all about. Id say it's a must read! Suspense. Thriller. Great job for a debut. 
18,Elphaba J,"Opinião completa em: http://historiasdeelphaba.blogspot.pt...É realmente fácil perceber o sucesso desta história, o seu ritmo que embala e abraça o leitor nesta viagem complexa pela mente humana, a três vozes, com três destinos paralelos que não se vêem, desfocados nos seus percursos diferentes que nos prendem à narrativa de A Rapariga no Comboio.Paula Hawkins deu largas à sua imaginação e fez-me mergulhar profundamente na sua ficção, com o desejo de saber até onde levaria a sua rapariga presa aos carris de um transporte comum, presa entre o seu passado e presente, presa entre estações, enquanto tece palavras e pensamentos ilusórios, mas fortes, que tornam esta obra viciante na busca pela coerência e junção de factos deste thriller psicológico que, também em terras lusas, promete conquistar leitores. A sua escrita, algumas vezes complexa e outras tantas vezes tão natural, é quase encantatória, com o nível certo de suspense e mistério que nos impulsiona sempre para o próximo capítulo.Rachel, Megan e Anna, são três mulheres diferentes e com universos singulares que, passo a passo, em momentos temporais próximos, nos contam os seus segredos mais íntimos e expõem as suas emoções mais cruas. São três rastilhos dissonantes que se vão envolvendo e enlaçando rumo a um desfecho quase óbvio mas cego na sua resolução, um desfecho construído de sentimentos, convicções, atitudes e acções contraditórias que estão longe de revelar tudo o que o leitor anseia por descobrir."
19,Paolo Aceves,"Every year I try to read a book written from the present year, the year is almost over and I realized I had yet to read a book from 2015 so this year's honor went to The Girl on the Train and what a good choice that was.We are introduced to Rachel every day she takes the morning train to London and on her way she spots a couple outside their house, ""Jason & Jess"", through her commute she creates a fantasy story of them, of the happily married perfect couple. Through them she projects her own failures and insecurities and turns it into the opposite of her own life in order to avoid seeing the house that used to belong to her a couple of houses away. One day she looks into the house and sees ""Jess"" with another man and that devastates her, the perfect couple she made up in her mind was not what she thought, and to complicate matters worse the next day she learns Jess/Megan has disappeared and a mystery begins to unravel. The book gives a really hard look into alcoholism and abuse, we see Rachel battling with it and how she became the person she is in that moment. She gives us a glimpse of her past life, how her marriage ended and how her life went down the drain. Through the mystery of Megan's disappearance she finds a new purpose trying to help find her and who is guilty of it. We also get the story one year before from Megan as she tries to keep her secrets and we get clues of who the culprit of her disappearance is. The reveal is obvious, but the way the book gets us there is well crafted Paula Hawkins deserves all the praise she is receiving by writing one of the best books of the year. "
20,Sandi,For fans of Gone Girl. 
21,Chrissy,"I was incredibly skeptical on this one, but ended up really enjoying it. Everyone is going to call it the Gone Girl of 2015 and it's hard not to compare the two books even though the plots are completely different. It's fast-paced and cringeworthy at times (in a good way). I would recommend for anyone who enjoys a good who-done-it."
22, Chele,Dysfunctional and flawed characters. Good story that kept my interest. I enjoyed it and look forward to more of this author's books. A solid 3.5
23,Melody,"Honestly speaking, this book isn't supposed to be on my priority reading list. Well, I do want to read it at some point but the hype and all the glowing reviews I read have made me change my mind. To avoid spoilers, my thoughts on this book would be vague and the characterisations is about all I could say. The story is told in three perspectives: Rachel, Megan and Anna. Three different women who aren't really happy with their life. Rachel is a divorcee but couldn't seem to get her ex-husband, Tom, out of her mind. She is also an alcoholic. Megan is a married woman who seems blissful in her marriage but she has a secret no one knows. She's also living in an area where Rachel used to live before the divorce, and there's a railway track nearby. Anna is the current wife of Tom. The three women's lives become inexorably intertwined after Rachel found an interesting couple during her regular train rides that would later change all their lives altogether. After reading The Girl on the Train, I can understand why it is a top seller. It is suspenseful and there is something about unreliable narrators that makes you wonder about their voices and behaviours and whether or not should you believe them. And in most cases they aren't likeable characters, either. Still, I enjoy reading books with such narrators because they are unpredictable and it is always fun to see if my guess is correct in the end. I know there are mixed reviews on this book, and while I felt it compelling it didn't 'wow' me the way I had wanted it to be. Still, it was a page-turner and I enjoyed reading it. I wasn't surprised that this book has been optioned for film by DreamWorks and I am curious to see how it would turn out with the film adaptation. I would definitely be on a look out for Ms. Hawkins' next release. "
24,Judy Lindow,"It's a page turner! Especially in the last 30 pages. However, in my opinion, it's no Gone Girl. Similar, yes, but the twists are more predictable. I found the the characters in Gone Girl much more interesting. At the beginning it sort of reminded me Rear Window, the way someone with a disability witnesses a crime while casually watching their neighbors. Rachel, the main character/detective, is in fact disabled by her depression and addiction at the beginning. Solving the crime and bringing clarity to the relationship with her husband, end up being a parallel denouement. This main narrator in this book is drinking all the time! In fact a lot of the characters are tossing around some kind of booze, much of the time. There is also a lot of serial adultery - let this book be a warning to you! haha! The men roughing up their spouses and running the show is sort of cliche. It's a wonder they can even function. Obviously by the end we're seeing the pile up of all this disfunction. I guess I liked Gone Girl a lot because she was so smart and conniving. In this book the key women are all victims of some kind of abuse. From start to finish it does stay true to the premise that ""Things are not always what they appear to be"". Oh, and there's a final, tiny little twist that you may or may not expect - but may miss if you're nodding off."
25,Sandy,"This was a book club pick and I must say it was pretty good. I liked the mysterious build up to the ending, even though I thought the ending could have been better. The character development was great and I liked all of them. It was well organized and I told from different view points, which made it more interesting. "
26,Stacy Natal,"I think that it is interesting that this book is being compared to Gone Girl. I liked it much better than Flynn's novel and didn't find the styles that similar. What they have in common is that they are both thrillers with a twist... in this book's case, several twists. The characters are deliciously flawed and each seems either unreliable or guilty. 4.5 stars"
27,Joann,"Although I had a terrible time liking any of the characters, I still found this a great mystery. Read fast because I couldn't wait to see how it ended."
28,Nicole Shepard,"This book was a very interesting read and very well written. I was amazed that by the time I got to about page 140 nothing had really happened - you didn't have much information at all but I was still compelled to keep reading. The book is narrated by three different women and switches between them which keeps things interesting. This book keeps being compared with Gone Girl but it's really nothing like it - a completely unique story. Also, Paula's description of commuting via train really makes me wish I had that option!"
29,Joana,"Primeiras impressões: não é assim tão extraordinário como todas as críticas faziam prever. Lê-se bem, mas estava à espera de mais emoção e enredo. Muito empenho na construção psicológica das personagens, mas preferia mais suspense no desenrolar da história. Ainda assim, vale a pena para quem gosta do género."
30,Valeria Atzori,"Scorrevole, avvincente nonostante la trama non troppo originale. Una lettura estiva azzeccata."
31,Matthew,"I READ A POPULAR BOOK FOR THE FIRST TIME BASICALLY EVER, ONE THAT PEOPLE I KNOW HAVE HEARD OF AND THAT MAYBE I CAN TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT IN THE REAL WORLD WITH MY SPEAKING VOICE. The ending could have been twenty pages shorter but it's certainly a good book to read when you've given up drinking for Lent."
32,Julissa Boyd,Great read. Kept me in suspense.
33,Stefanie Kellum,"I figured out who did it a little over halfway through, but I still enjoyed this clever, mind-bending thriller full of unreliable narrators, red herrings, and beautifully-written yet chilling prose. It makes you wonder how much you don't know about people...even those closest to you. Great read for when you're in the mood for a good old-fashioned murder mystery."
34,Lamar,"I feel like The Girl on the Train deserves more than 3.5 stars, yet 4 stars would be much more than it deserves, so maybe 3.7, perhaps? It wasn't perfect, but good enough to keep me going. 

“I’m playing at real life instead of actually living it.”

I have to clear something first: I hate it, hate it, when advertisers label books as 'the next blank' or 'this is hotter than blank' or 'this is just like blank, but much better' and The Girl on the Train was one of those cases. Worse, this book got all hyped up because of that, which is, I presume, what essentially the advertisers wanted. People went into this book with high expectation because hello? Have you read Gone Girl? It's a mind-fuck and awesome, but were left with nothing but disappointment because this is not quite like Gone Girl, not in the way you might think. It's so sad for The Girl on the Train because I think people might have liked it more if it weren't compared to Gone Girl.This is why I don't like this marketing strategy, because I think it's unfair, it's not fair for the new book, it's not fair for the book that's being compared to. When everyone, literally everyone, claimed it as ""the next Gone Girl"" I got the same feeling I had when I heard people calling George R.R. Martin ""The American Tolkien"" It bothers me because why can't George just be George R. R. Martin, the first and the last? I love Gone Girl, and its originality and the I've-never-ever-read-anything-like-this-before feeling that I got when I read it.So let's not compare these books together just because this book involved unreliable characters and a missing girl. I will say: If you loved Gone Girl, you might also enjoy The Girl on the Train. That doesn't mean it's as mind-fucking as Gone Girl, it doesn't mean it has this big fucking reveal that will make you want to scrub your brain, no no, it's a different plot-line, it's simply dark and edgy which is what a thriller should be, thrillers like Gone Girl and other books. Now, the book itself. Like I said, it wasn't perfect but damn I had so much fun with it. It had just the right amount of thriller tension to keep me fixated on reading rather than listening to the pounding of the workmen in our kitchen. It was suspenseful, addictive, and one of those stories where you cannot trust anyone. The ending didn't appeal to some people but I personally liked it, it was well-thought-out.The writing I wouldn't say was anywhere near special, it didn't stand out for me (hence the 3.7 stars) the pace was a bit slow at the beginning, yet not boring but later on I was completely hooked.

“There’s nothing so painful, so corrosive, as suspicion.”

I'll definitely pick up Hawkins's future books, I think they'll be a huge step from her debut. Recommended to anyone who likes mystery thrillers."
35,Isa Cantos (Crónicas de una Merodeadora),"Me debato entre un 3.75 y un 4... Ya han pasado un par de días desde que terminé el libro y aún no me aclaro muy bien sobre si me gustó mucho o un poco menos que eso o qué, jajaja. Vamos a ver, La Chica del Tren sigue las historias de varias personas, pero sobre todo de Rachel, una mujer cuya vida se ha ido desbaratando en los últimos años. Pasó de estar felizmente casada a divorciarse, tener problemas con la bebida, con las personas y con su trabajo. Rachel vive con su casera y, para que ella no se entere de que ha perdido el trabajo, sigue tomando el tren de las 8.04 para ir a Londres y el de la tarde para volver a Ashbury todos los días. En sus trayectos de tren, Rachel siempre ve una calle llena de casas en donde solía vivir con su marido Tom, antes de que él la cambiara por Anna y su hija pequeña. Además de eso, en una de las casas vive una pareja que, a ojos de Rachel, es perfecta. Incluso les ha puesto nombres a pesar de que no los conoce, ella los llama Jess y Jason. El punto de todo esto es que, un día, Rachel ve algo extraño en la casa de Jess y Jason y, al siguiente, Jess (cuyo nombre real es Megan) es reportada como una persona desaparecida. El punto de todo esto es que Rachel siente que debe ser parte de la investigación porque sabe que estuvo por ahí el día de la desaparición, aunque lo malo es que no recuerda nada porque su problema con el alcohol es tan serio que incluso tiene lagunas mentales. La Chica del Tren, entonces, empieza a jugar con una narración no lineal y a tres voces: hay capítulos narrados por Rachel, otros por Anna y algunos por Megan. A lo largo del libro vemos cómo son las vidas de estas tres mujeres, de sus esposos, de sus hijos... y los conocemos como se supone que son realmente. La cosa aquí es que la autora juega con las perspectivas y con la información que nos va dando de tal manera que nos hace pensar que *conocemos* a los personajes cuando realmente no es así. Siempre hay un halo de misterio y de incertidumbre que rodea todo lo que nos está contando Rachel o lo que cree recordar de sus lagunas mentales. Así pues, cuando vamos llegando al final del libro y vemos cómo el misterio de la desaparición de Megan se va aclarando, nos damos cuenta de que estuvimos completamente engañados durante más de 300 páginas. Que lo que parece ser no es siempre lo que realmente es... y creo que ese es uno de los puntos fuertes de este libro. De nuevo, cuando lees el final, entiendes un montón de datos o de circunstancias descritas que en un principio parecían súper gratuitas, pero que, claramente, no lo eran. Pero bueno, ¿por qué digo que no sé si ponerle 3.75 o 4 estrellas o qué? Sigo sin tenerlo muy claro, pero creo que el ritmo del libro es un poco lento, yo no encontré el ansia de seguir leyendo compulsivamente cada página como muchas personas me decía que me iba a pasar. Quizá otra de las razones por las que no disfruté tanto de la historia es que el hype (la reputación, por decirlo de alguna manera) de este libro estaba por las nubes. Lo pintaban TAAAAN bien, que esperaba algo extraordinario, pero yo no lo encontré. En fin, eso pasa cuando lees un libro con las expectativas tan altas, supongo, jajaja. Sin embargo, sí que lo recomiendo para los amantes del misterio y de los thrillers ambientados en Inglaterra."
36,miss♥k,"I have lost control over everything, even the places in my head.A ""Trust No One"" and ""Hate Everyone"" kind of ""Whoddunit"". The formula of a modern psychological thriller ( ie Gone Girl ) is on point.. We have a missing woman, we have adulatory, we have alcoholism, and we have trains. Something about those trains made the story more eerie and Hitchcock like. I had extremely high expectations for this and maybe that's why it fell just a tiny bit flat for me. Over all a true page turner!We meet Rachel.. Who once had everything, the husband, the house, the life... and now she has nothing but her alcohol and the stories she makes up as she watches ""happy"" people as she rides the trains to a place she no longer works every morning. Then we meet Megan, one of those ""happy"" people Rachel sees on her daily route, with her beautiful house and her handsome husband. Last but not least we meet Anna, who lives in Rachel's former ""perfect"" life. But nothing is ever as it seems from the inside of a train window. The chapters alternate narrators between these characters, which may sometimes get confusing, but in this case was written quite well. "
37,Alexis Bautista,"i loved the pacing of this book. Like others have said, the use of the unreliable narrator added to the suspense of the novel. You are trying to piece together a story through the eyes of a drunk, a liar and the blissfully ignorant. The fourth and most reliable narrator is of course the train, which the author weaves into the story quite nicely. Though the ending was predictable, I could not put this book down. I am not sure I would call this the next Gone Girl- both stories are great in their own rights. I would definitely recommend this book to those that love thrillers! "
38,Sally,One word....twisted....
39,Betty Morrissey,I liked it AND it kept me guessing. 
40,Mary Rose,"I would really rate this book 3.5 stars but decided to round up. What can I say? I like the unlikeable characters. I've read other reviews where this seemed to be a complaint, and I understand, I do. If I don't like a main character sometimes I just can't do it. And even though the redeeming qualities in these characters are slim, I think I enjoyed them because it was a way for Hawkins to expound on the theme that everybody lies, especially to themselves. And sometimes those little lies you tell yourself every day turn into one big one that you eventually have to face.I also loved the idea of the train. The constant movement, watching people and houses as they pass, watching other passengers, feeling the shuffle of the carriages, the smells (even the gross ones) - those were all captured excellently and I think Hawkins used the train as a symbol to her advantage. The only thing I was a little disappointed in was that I guessed the whodunit fairly early on. Not like twenty pages early, but still kind of early. This would be the one point I would rate the book down on, except I wonder if Hawkins didn't write this way intentionally. Having an idea of the culprit lets you look for clues and inconsistencies. I much prefer that than some out of the blue character no reader with two brain cells to rub together would ever suspect.So, I gave the author the benefit of the doubt and rated up. It's a great read. I finished it in a weekend because I couldn't put it down."
41,Alyse Liebovich,"I struggled with what to rate this book...I was leaning more towards 3/3.5 stars because I didn't find really any redeemable qualities of any of the characters, and specifically, the whole alcoholic excuse was a bit too repetitive and annoying in my opinion. What pushed my rating up to 4 stars is that the story admittedly did hold my attention/curiosity (more than the 8 YA novels I've started and not finished in the past few months) enough that I looked forward to figuring out the mystery, and after I found out the ""who done it,"" I realized a very important detail about the chapters from Megan's perspective that I won't mention for spoiler alert purposes. "
42,_dropaheart,"If it wasn't for the end this would be a 3 star. It was kind of monotonous during the read. Not completely bad but good enough to keep you intrigued and needing to know what's going on. Basically Rachel is an alcoholic who's husband left her for his mistress (Anna who in the middle of the read I hated and was a complete cry baby bitch) so Rachel moved in with her friend Cathy. She rides the train everyday looking at the house she used to live in with her husband, and a couple houses before she sees, who she calls, Jess and Jason. Her imagination is vivid and she's usually always drunk so she makes up little stories about them and how they have a perfect life and super inlove all from her daily observations from the train. But then someone in the town disappears and Rachel's mind spirals into confusion cause she doesn't remember what happened because being blackout drunk is a bitch and she's trying to remember the night that the person turns up missing and why she... I'm gonna just stop and not spill all the beans ;)Sounds kinda plain. But then there's the ending! And you're like ""whaaaaa?!"" And about halfway through it'll start picking up, you'll find yourself trying to figure it out and notice you've started reading faster and fasterI've read a lot of reviews comparing this to gone girl. I can see how that is true. Although me being a massive Gillian Flynn fan, this is a runner up solely because I can't get myself to think someone being better than her in this genera. Which...this book isn't better than hers. But nonetheless it was pretty good.Writing style was great. Clear and comprehendible. Character build got slightly confusing at times but if you just kept going it all unfolded itself leaving you to say ""ohhhhh"" lolDo I recommend? Yes. If you like gone girl then I do. Keeping in mind it's probably not gonna be better than gone girl to you, but it's still a good read. But if you're easily squeamish then no. Don't read it. "
43,Katrina Grajeda,I enjoyed that this book was easy to read and fast paced. And I did like the twist at the end. Good suspense novel
44,La chica que leía,4.5
45,Stephanie,"Super fun. Yes, you can compare it to Gone Girl. But not really."
46,Maria Hamilton,"This was an easy read and pretty difficult to put down! I really enjoyed it and can recommend as a read that definitely makes you think about things!Initially I found Rachel very annoying - she was weak and shameful in her behaviour. But the more I read, the more her behaviour made sense and I ended up understanding how she got to her low point. She really had a lot of help getting there. There were some interesting characters in the book - and although I suspected who did it half way through, it was unpredictable enough to really make me think... you never really know the people around you; what they are going through; what's in their history to make them who they are. We all make judgements every single day - just from fleeting moments - and sometimes we should all sit back and give people around us a chance. You don't know why people act they way they do - what had made them get to a certain point in their life. Made me think!"
47,Shauna,I had my moments where I thought it was too bizarre of a book but I did like the ending. Overall it was still a good read.
48,Elisabeth,"Awesome suspense building, plot and writing style. Characters I wish were UNDER the train..."
49,Barbara Bohlmann,"Best mystery I've read in a while. A few grammatical hiccups that annoyed me, but enjoyed the ride (pardon the pun) and didn't want to put it down. "
50,Natalea,"Gone Girl-like, but better. Problem was, I didn't like any of the characters, wasn't rooting for anyone so the twist and turns, although nicely done, left me a bit cold.The motives were a bit unclear here and there as well.However, I read the 80% of the book in the last 24 hours which doesn't happen every day."
51,L.A. Starks,"Although the Bechdel test http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_... is used for movies, it is instructive to apply it to books. Here we have three female narrators and every scene is about men.The work is so original that it surpasses the genre limitations of romantic suspense, and it certainly doesn't have a neat, expected ending. And, it deals with big issues in women's lives-relationships and children-so it is profound and affecting.The writing and plotting are superb. The scenes about trying to recover memories from blackouts are suspenseful.Nonetheless, it would have been more gratifying to read about three women who weren't unemployed and who had something bigger going on in their lives."
52,Edwin Lang,"I enjoyed and recommend The Girl on the Train. It is a light but rewarding read. The characters especially the lead women, are real and human, foibles and all, and Paula Hawkins tells a compelling tale.Rachel Watson, as the main character, was well drawn out, as the still-fresh ex-wife of a man that had married a woman who whom he had had an affair. The story takes place primarily on Blenheim street which backs onto a railway line. Rachel, jobless, nonetheless takes a train to London under the pretext of going to her job but her primary goal is to stay connected to the lives of her ex, Tom, and his new wife whose house – her former home – she can get a good view of as the train regularly slows down in that area because of issues with the railway track. Rachel is an alcoholic, and suffers the mental anguish of the addiction and the increasing isolation she experiences as her life appears to completely unravel, exacerbated by not only her obsessive preoccupation with her ex and his new life / wife, by their baby – Rachel was barren – and by a fantasy she has developed of the perfect couple whom she calls Jason an Jess who live close to Tom and his wife. I had trouble putting the book down. I took an immediate liking to Rachel, and as the story line alternated between Rachel, Anna (Tom’s wife) and Megan – Rachel’s Jess, with Rachel getting top billing, it became fascinating to get the different viewpoints on Rachel’s behaviour. What was also fascinating was whether Rachel was real or not, and this is just my perspective and I mention it from the perspective that psychologically she was a mess and mentally her brain was cooked from her alcoholism. So when she spoke or saw something, could the reader assume that this was what was really happening. But what Hawkins achieved I think was a story in which I could give Rachel the benefit of the doubt and keep believing in her. It was a strange sensation: on one hand, everyone around her doubted her sanity based on what they could visibly see of her behaviour, but the reader – knowing much more about why she could be completely insane – seemed willing not to lose faith in her. There were moments where it was easy to conclude that she was the killer, that the drinking had not made her neurotic, it just camouflaged her psychosis. But Hawkins made it so that we were willing to wait and see how things turned out. The men in the story fared not so well but it seemed ok: after reading Simone du Beauvoir’s The Second Sex when I was 20 I became and remained kind of comfortable and respectful around women, so it was neat to become for a while engrossed in this woman-centric story . Edwin"
53,Mohawkgrl," This was lauded as a thriller but I would categorize the novel more as a mystery simply because I never got goosebumps reading about the characters nor the story itself. The concept of three different first person narratives each with their own POV, was spot on, as it allows for more of an in-depth look at the story arch and its subsequent climax.  Near the end, I was however, able to easily predict who the antagonist was ahead of the 'big reveal'. I completely enjoyed this debut novel by Paula Hawkins. Looking forward to her sophomore effort. "
54,Leau0405,"I've noticed there are some comments saying that the storytelling is flat and a little bit boring in the first 280pages or so before Rachel realised who's behind all the horiffic things, well, that I really cannot agree with...Unlike many other thrillers，if you think about it, there's only one main suspense surrounding the whole story in this book, that is, the missing memories of Rachel about the night when Jess went missing. The narration from perspectives of different(and often unreliable) narrators all added to the building up of the sense of suspense and thrill, which, I gather, made such a thriller with not-so-complicated storylines actually gripping to read.Another thing worth noticing is that the whole book was written in a diary-like way. It's not an easy thing to create some alcoholic and mentally unstable or disloyal characters who's lives are total messes yet can still let the readers pity for them and feel for them. When Paula Hawkins has chosen to tell this story in the first person, she's enabled us readers to empathize with the characters of her novel. When reading the story, we see what Rachal saw when she's sad and wasted on her own, we feel what Jess felt when her baby died because of her.Yes, there's no denying that the lack of plot twist is the main reason why many people don't like The Girl on the Train. Yet, should the same story be handed to someone else to finish, it might ended up being really boring. Maybe Paula Hawkins's polished writting skills and well-crafted storytelling have something to do with her experiences as a journaliste. Stories are always there, sometimes fascinating sometimes not, it's the way you tell them that matters."
55,prettybooks,"Ce train qui sépare Rachel de ce couple apporte à ce thriller un contexte original et cette femme dépressive et alcoolique en devient malgré tout attachante. J’ai été intriguée par ce thriller jusqu’à la fin mais un peu déçue des révélations et sans aucun doute gênée par l’ambiance pesante, le brouillard perpétuel et la confusion qui règne dans l’esprit de Rachel. Un livre particulier et original.Ma chronique : https://myprettybooks.wordpress.com/2..."
56,Shannon Hardegree,I've never had a book where I absolutely hated every character (every single one!) but still liked the book. Took me a quarter of the way through before I was hooked but after that I finished it in one day. 
57,Xana,"Há anos que não me acontecia começar e acabar um livro no mesmo dia.As expectativas eram muitas até começar a ler algumas opiniões menos boas,por isso comecei o livro sem esperar muito dele.Foi uma surpresa... não é uma obra prima da literatura, no entanto não o consegui largar o dia todo. Agarrou-me de tal forma que só queria saber o fim. Não m surpreendeu mto o culpado,pois comecei a desconfiar cedo, mas gosteiGostei mesmo muito e aconselho!!E não achei nada parecido com o parte incerta.. desse nem gostei por aí além este está muito melhor conseguido na minha opinião. "
58,Jen,"I had a love hate relationship with this book. It was fascinating and kept me compulsively reading it but the content is preeeettttty heavy and I mostly read in bed at night before going to sleep - I often thought, ""Why am I reading this? I'm going to have horrible nightmares after this."" But like any good mystery, I had to know ""whodunnit"" - and I'll admit, the ending surprised me. I think I must have suspected everybody in the book at some point, so I'd say that's a sign that the author did a good job!"
59,Marie-Dominique,"I have read this in three days. Three days of suspense, excitement and questions.I really loved the book and the way we get to know more and more on each character at each chapter. Somehow it reminded me of Gone Girl.And like gone girl I was disappointed by the end. I knew it was Tom at half of the book. But still it was entertaining to read and I was really curious about the story. "
60,Jenny Bensko,Even though I felt the story line was frustrating and disturbing- I couldn't put this book down until the end. I tend to always fall for a good suspense story. :) 
61,June,"Having read 50 pages, I said ""it was overhyped""; halfway through, I started collecting loopholes while predicting ""plot twist""; with 1/4 left I became really appreciate the narrative style and plot structure. It's not only riveting, but also created a heroine - one of the most unusual and enduring, as well as other credible characters - well-fit puzzle pieces. "
62,Michelle ,"3.5 stars. Not at all what I was expecting. I kept wondering what was going on in the first half of this book and it took a while to get into. The second half flew by and literally read finished it in a day. The characters are pretty awful, the situation even more awful and yet I had to find out what happened to these people. "
63,Cinthya_ch,"Rating: 4 stars2015 Reading Challenge: A book that takes place in another country (not my own, not USA)I am pleasantly surprised with The Girl on the Train. The book came with a lot of hype behind it, being compared with a favorite of mine, Gone Girl, but after reading a couple of bad reviews I was not sure I was going to enjoy it, but actually I did, and a lot.The first thing I liked about this book was that I had no sympathy for any character in this book, at first I had it for one character and it turns out that she/he was the one that deserved my complete hatred, which leads me to the second think I enjoyed, the author fooled me in almost everything, I guessed one thing but the way things developed after that was completely unexpected. I was biting my nails the whole time, trying to guess what had happened. The main narrator was unreliable; the POVS from the three women had details that confused me. The attitude from the side characters were misleading, everything added to the whole mystery and I loved it. The book pulled out of me very strong emotions; I wanted to hit characters, especially Rachel, because I just wanted her to rise from all the things that were happening to her and from the way people were treating her.The Girl on the Train deals with many controversial topics like cheating, abortion, the desire to become a mother and not having the chance to do so, alcoholism, domestic violence. It was very depressing since page one, but sometimes I just need to read something like that and this one was perfect. Totally recommended if someone likes Gillian Flynn, she is a better writer than Paula Hawkins, but the latter gives Gillian a run for her money.I was totally satisfied about the way the book ended, a very very good thriller that kept me guessing the whole time. PS. Honestly after reading books like Gone Girl, The husband´s secret and this one I don´t get why people want to get married, I know the scenarios presented here are extreme but still… "
64,Annalee Storey,"Wow! A thrilling read to the very end. I can't rate it 5 stars because I didn't love the language and scandalous scenes, but I honestly couldn't put it down. Won't sleep very well tonight..."
65,Bobbi Jo,Very intriguing and suspenseful. Definitely a page turner!
66,Christina,Read it in a day. Terrible people written so well. I called it early on. But I enjoyed the ride. Can't wait for the movie. Someone call Keira Knightly. 
67,Christine,Full review on my blog: http://padfootslibrary.blogspot.ca/20...
68,Kiesha,"Even though I enjoyed reading this book, I have to give it 3.5 stars."
69,Martha Bogart,"This was an easy, quick read. It held your interest and was a page turner, but the ending was a bit of a letdown. I liked the way it was written in multiple voices over different time periods. Characters were not very likeable. Premise was interesting, but the final reveal was not that surprising."
70,Danielle Rider Mahan,"The hype lead me to believe it would be the same caliber as Gone Girl. Silly me for believing the hype. It was overall a decent read, it just wasn't as suspenseful as I was hoping."
71,Amber (Cosying Up With Books),"For all the hype this book is getting I was ever so slightly underwhelmed. Don't get me wrong, I liked it! But I had pretty much worked it out and guessed the rest half way through the book. By the end the entire reasoning behind what happened seemed petty. BUT the creeps were immense and some of the revelations, especially from the three women, were shiver worthy.Reviewing books like this is hard because everything is a hint at something that happens in the book but I shall try and I will do it spoiler-free. Yay!"
72,Josefa,3.75*
73,Coleen,"This book seems to have gotten a lot of hype prior to its release. I was excited to be a lucky early reviewer & even more excited when I saw the really cool outer covering that the book came in -- a ""window"" peeking into the book, representing the window on the train. Another example of a book sucking me in with its cover art.This is billed as a psychological thriller, and it is, although not necessarily an edge-of-your seat one. Rachel is a young woman living on the outskirts of London. She commutes daily into the city, and one day she witnesses something through the train window that inevitably involves her in a crime investigation. This wasn't really a fast-paced novel, although I did get sucked in and read it rather quickly. Rachel is divorced, but still in love with her ex-husband, who has remarried. She's depressed. She drinks -- a lot. She continually makes bad or questionable decisions. I wavered between feeling sorry for her and being fed up with her. But yet I kept reading, and tried to figure out how the book was going to end before I got there. It's a good, although not quite excellent, read. Near the end, things started moving quickly, and then ultimately were tidied up a little too neatly in my opinion. But still a good read -- I was reading almost right up until midnight on New Year's Eve in order to finish this one, and it's one that will appeal to many readers in the new year. "
74,Julia Putnam,"Everyone raved about this book! For the first third or so, I wondered why - it was good and everything but I didn't understand the excitement. Then I got it. Hawkins does an AMAZING job of keeping the reader on their toes. You never know which direction to look and that's amazing. I feel like the writing style was perfect in keeping the suspense and keeping you guessing. The jumping forward to look back added to the mystery. It was great. I'd recommend it to just about anyone."
75,Meri,"It delivered what it promised. This book was definitely a page turner, and a welcome distraction from the flight from hell. If you're looking for an engrossing book that will keep you guessing about what will happen next, look no farther."
76,Courtney Wells,I do not know who handles Ms. Hawkins' marketing and promotion but am interested to learn if they accept first born children in exchange for their diabolical pact services.
77,Gabby,"One word I would use to describe the book ""The Girl on the Train"" by Paula Hawkins would be ""truth"". This book is a mystery, through different points in time and different perspectives. All of them slowly unravel the layers of the mystery, until you figure out the actual truth.The book begins in the perspective of a woman named Rachel who lives in England. You find that she is in a low point in her life. Divorced, living temporarily in the home of her friend, and having a drinking problem. However, on her train ride to her work, she fantasizes about a particular house of a married couple. Although she knows nothing about the actual couple, she imagines their whole life, including their names. The book then switches perspective to a younger woman named Megan, except it is two months earlier. She herself is at an awkward point in her life. The book follows the two women in their respective time lines, until suddenly, someone goes missing. The story continues following different perspectives until the end when the two timelines collide, and the truth is revealed.I struggled to connect with any of the characters. There were few of them in the story, and of those that were, there was no connection between them and me. Most all of the characters had adult problems, such as alcoholism, infidelity, and financial difficulties, all of which are difficult to connect with.I give the book a big thumbs up because it was a huge page turner. The information is revealed at a pace such that you are swept into any moment, and then suddenly the perspective and time change. It leaves you with no option but to silently scream in anger and keep reading (as I did multiple times). As a mystery, it is not to hard to follow, nor to easy to solve. The different views of the characters leads you into one lead or thought, and then a sudden change in the story shows you that everything is wrong, and you are led to start all over again. It is quite an aggravating but rewarding process. Those who love mysteries might enjoy this, especially if you like things beyond your typical Sherlock Holmes. Also someone who enjoys fiction of everyday life with a twist would quickly fall in love with this."
78,Vania Prodanova,"Жадната ми за трилър душа е доволна. Още с първите две страници се подхлъзваш да четеш, а започнеш ли един път, е адски трудно да спреш. Чак се улавях, че препускам през думите, за да видя какво ще последва. Навсякъде из книгата има малки ""улики"", оставени от авторката, които насочват към убиеца на красивата и ""блуждаеща"" Меган. Истината е, че не е много трудно да се разбере кой е убиецът, все пак героите не са много, а и по пътя на логиката и зачеркване на обичайните заподозрени, е някак си лесно да разбереш кой е в крайна сметка. Въпреки това, е ужасно вълнуващо и интересно да разплиташ с всяка следваща глава парченце от пъзела и постепенно да се разкрива цялата картина.Структура на книгата ме плени. Историята се разказва от три гледни точки, тези на героините, което е прекрасно, тъй като виждаш едно и също събитие, от различен ъгъл и възприемане. Единствено фактът, че жените в тази книга са представени като алкохолички, емоционално незрели и наивни глупачки, примиращи за бебета и вниманието на мъже, ме подлуди. Сори, ама, имам по-високо мнение за своя пол и уменията ни да се справяме с кризите в живота. Това, всъщност помрачава хубавия трилър. Някак си не ми беше достоверно. Вероятно за целите на романа е ок, но имам чувството, че липсваше нещо, което да направи техните образи като жени с проблеми, по-реалистичен. :)"
79,Lia,"Didn't know what to expect from the book, but was pleasantly surprised. I had made several theories about who was the murderer but none was right. The characters are all messed up yes, but who cares? It's not all about character development, it's about the story. And this one was great."
80,Silvia Ribeiro,Não correspondeu às expetativas que eu tinha. Até o achei um pouco previsível. Mas não o consegui largar enquanto não o acabei. Daí as 4 estrelas pequeninas. A todos aqueles que acham este livro muito bom recomendo um policial nórdico. 
81,Krithika Sundar,4 starsWhat an amazing book. I was on the edge of my seat the entire 300+ pages. I loved every story of these characters in equal measure.Rachel is the girl on the train that goes thru the same route and sees the same house everyday and is so used to the loving couple called Jess and James in her mind. Perfect and loving.Except Rachel isn't happy. She's broken up from her husband who left her for another women. She's a drunk and her life is in shambles. One day she sees something that shatters her dream that Jess is the perfect women and later she gets hurt and doesn't remember anything from that night. What ensues is a thrilling tale and you have no idea what's going to happen next.Paula has written the book so well. Very twisted and crazy. Kind of a Gone Girl story but extraordinary in its own way. Paula spins the tale between 5 to 6 characters quite well. When you think that it's going to be boring only with 6 characters its not. You have no idea what's going to happen. What are these people going to do to each other. I felt the tale was twisted and sick sometimes. Not the pace but the fact that people are so twisted in this world and its a new kind of thrill to read it when it's written so well. A well hyped read that I felt was worth it hype.The one character I really liked was none other then Kamal Abdic. The way he was described and the way he's under control and takes his sessions. Great writing. An awesome read. Just don't read it when your sad.
82,Sara,Very entertaining!! Engaging thriller with a main character who is definitely a train wreck but I still somehow did not hate her and actually felt sorry for her. I would definitely read this author again.
83,Jerry,"We can easily appreciate the mixed reaction to “Train” and the inevitable comparisons to “Gone Girl” (which we had previously read). We also expect it may resonate better with most women than most men, as we spend much of the novel inside the heads of three different women, in sort of an existential discussion of relationship issues and everyday angst.The premise was pretty catchy – a woman who commutes daily on an hour-long train ride (between home and London) gets to “know” some of the residents she can see from the train, when it routinely stops mid-route for traffic issues. She is particularly enchanted with a couple named Jason and Jess, and fantasizes all sorts of goings-on about them. Soon enough we get to meet the couple in real life as the plot begins to unfold; and then we get alternating chapters of progress from Rachel (the train girl); Anna, Rachel’s ex-husband’s new wife; and “Jess”, the other woman. The interrelationships between these characters and their men, with occasional asides from Rachel’s roommate, eventually lead to a mysterious disappearance, shades of “Gone Girl”. A suspenseful latter half reveals all, with what seemed to us a poignant ending.We liked the very clever way that the author slowly uncovered what was really going on –it took a little while, but had us turning pages rapidly. While many readers will not necessarily find the three women that endearing, all the crossed interactions between them were intriguing to say the least. In the end, we were quite pleased and highly entertained."
84,Anna Dorywalska,"I had to convince myself to read this book. I still wouldn't have read it if not for my mum who got it for me. I thought it's probably overrated, not a good read and disappointing as it will not be as good as Gone Girl. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. Very good read, so much so, it took me two afternoons to finish.I formulated opinions about characters early on, which in my case is a good sign as it showed I cared about them - they felt real. There were moments I couldn't put the book down as I needed to know what happens next and almost to the very end (it pains me to admit it) I didn't figure out who's the murderer! Hawkins touches on various forms of relationships - marriage, female friendship, parent-child. She doesn't try to re-invent the wheel or show something we don't already know. Instead, she focused on highlighting how people can impact each other's decisions and doings, how important it is to deal with one's past before it takes over the present, what kind of bond is formed between those who share a live, a house, a secret... It wasn't overcomplicated but nuanced enough for it not to feel silly or like a caricature. The book is well-written, Hawkins' style is engaging and makes you come back for more. A definite 'yes' for recommendation."
85,Céline Vergne Bartniczak,"Avec ce premier livre, Paula Hawkins ne révolutionne pas le thriller. Vous y trouverez un mort, une enquête et un meurtrier, le tout dans un dénouement assez prévisible. Rien qui ne change les codes. Alors pourquoi un succès aussi impressionnant ? C’est vrai, je me suis posée la question car moi aussi, je suis tombée dans les filets de La fille du train. Et la réponse se trouve tout simplement dans son titre. Sa force, La fille du train le doit à ton son aspect psychologique et humain, à ses personnages dont cette fille dans le train, Rachel. L’enquête n’est qu’un prétexte pour nous parler de Monsieur et Madame tout le monde. Le sujet du livre, c’est eux, c’est vous, c’est nous avec nos façades parfaites et nos sombres secrets.Donc, ces personnages.La narration originale de La fille du train s’effectue à trois voix, celles de Rachel, Megan et Anna. Trois femmes que tout semble opposer mais qui vont être unies par une ville, son train et son meurtre (et d’autres choses que nous découvrirons au fil des pages). Avec une répartition de la parole bien construite, elles vont, l’une après l’autre, nous donner leurs points de vue, nous révélant leurs pensées les plus intimes sur les événements du livre.Et cette proximité va nous révéler trois femmes toute aussi antipathique l’une que l’autre. Mais Paula Hawkins réussie à les rendre humaines, surtout Rachel. A vrai dire, je me suis même retrouvée en elle (sans les canettes de Gin tonic dans le sac) : une femme pas parfaite qui veut juste bien faire les choses. Pourtant, Rachel a vraiment tout pour déplaire : alcoolique, divorcée, chômeuse, squatteuse, menteuse et trop curieuse. Vraiment l’inverse d’un portrait idyllique. L’anti-héroïne par excellence. Celle, paradoxalement, à laquelle nous finissons par nous y attacher. Et Megan et Anna ne sont pas mieux.Mais Rachel est malade, très malade. Ca n’excuse rien, bien au contraire. Sa dépression et son alcoolisme atteignent leur paroxysme la nuit du meurtre de Megan. Victime d’un grave black-out, Rachel ne se souviendra de rien. Paula Hawkins va jouer avec la mémoire de Rachel comme elle joue avec le lecteur. Entre fausses pistes et rebondissements, l’auteur fait monter la tension et vient rythmer l’intrigue de La fille du train.L’écriture hyper réaliste de Paula Hawkins va donc vous captiver. Qui a tué Megan ? Qui sont vraiment les trois héroïnes ? Quel est le lien ? Rachel va-t-elle se souvenir ? Tout un tas de questions qui vous tiendra sans difficulté en haleine. Mais des réponses qui auront aussi comme effet de vous rappeler que quelque part, nous sommes tous un peu voyeur dans l’âme.--> http://www.celineonline.fr/la-fille-d..."
86,Brian,"I did not find this book to be very compelling at the outset. I thought Rachel, the primary narrator, was more annoying than interesting. But I'm glad I stuck with it. The story picked up steam as it went along and pulled me in.The story unfolds through the alternating perspectives of three first-person narrators who have conflicting perspectives on the events that touch all three of them. This unorthodox narrative structure works well for the story, as it keeps the reader guessing. Whose version of the facts, if anyone's, is reliable?Were Alfred Hitchcock still alive, this would be a great story for him to adapt into a movie."
87,Rowan,"I understand why people think that this is comparable to Gone Girl; they share a lot of similarities, especially with their use of an unreliable narrator. I really enjoyed it -- it was compelling to read, and if life hadn't gotten in the way I probably could've read it in one sitting! I did see the ending ""twist"" coming (about halfway through the book, actually) but that didn't make the way that the book played out any less exciting!"
88,Tetiana Syniook,"Є книжки, на які пишеш рецензії, а є такі, які просто хочеш порадити почитати. ""Дівчина в потязі"" - саме така. Я читала її на роботі, в метро, в гостях, на зупинці, вдома на дивані, на кухні, під час крутіння хулахупа. Навіть у черзі в супермаркеті аж зубами клацала від нетерпіння знову розгорнути чорну книжку з недоладним заголовком ""Дівчина у потягу"". Але байдуже на ті помилки, якщо тобі справді цікаво. Якщо по-справжньому страшно, і кожен різкий звук розбиває ту густу інтимну тишу, що виникає між тобою і книжкою, лякаючи, змушуючи серце битися частіше. Я потираю руки від задоволення, я тріумфую - мені давно не було так моторошно від чорних літер на білому тлі. Найстрашніші жахи часто відбуваються на території шлюбу - зовні часто ідеального. Якщо ви бачите усміхнену пару, де чоловік турбується про жінку, а жінка віддячує йому любов'ю й вірністю, вважайте, що вони ідеальна пара. Тільки ніколи, чуєте, ніколи не намагайтеся довідатися про них більше. Так, ви почуватиметеся спустошеними, самотніми й недосконалими, зате не заклякнете від жаху, випадково зробивши несподіване для себе відкриття. Але Рейчел Ватсон виявилася надто допитливою. Після розлучення з коханим чоловіком Томом, тривалих запоїв і постійного спостереження за його новим шлюбом її життя перетворилося на жах. Щоранку минаючи свій колишній будинок, що став домом для іншої жінки, чужої дитини, Рейчел картається власною самотністю й нікчемністю. Крізь вікно потяга вона щодня кілька секунд упивається поглядом туди, де вона колись була щасливою.І могла б бути зараз - як і Том, як і його сусіди - красива пара Джесс і Джейсон.Але настає день, і Джесс зникає, а Меган відчуває, що може допомогти Джейсону її відшукати.Це я так по-своєму переказала анотацію. Бо безсила говорити про сюжет - щоб уникнути спойлерів.Натомість скажу, що мене вразило. Майстерність оповіді авторки, Поли Гоукінз і простота тих засобів, до яких вона вдається, заманюючи читача в пастку тексту. Здавалося, це дуже пласко і просто - говорити по черзі від імені персонажів у вигляді щоденникових нотаток. От що може бути простіше? Який літературний прийом дешевший від цього? Однак у Поли Гоукінз виходить насправді страшно, атмосферно. Психологічно напружено. А тому, виходить, майстерно.Її персонажі одержимі. Незалежно від статі, незалежно від того, самотні вони чи у шлюбі, закохані чи покинуті. Кожен із нас одержимий минулим, яке спливло, і майбутнім, якому не судилося відбутися з нами. А ще - ненавистю до тих, хто це майбутнє у нас відібрав. Звісно, для посилення ефекту страху ідеться також про дітей - мертвих, живих і ненароджених. Дітей, яких хотіли, і дітей, які виявилися непотрібними. Без незримої присутності образів дітей, які й слова не вимовляють упродовж усього роману, не було б так моторошно. Черговий дешевий прийомчик, який пробирає до кісток, і ти пробачаєш авторці.Ну і несподіваний фінал. Я не могла уявити, що моральною потворою виявиться саме цей персонаж. Хоча я й не намагалася уявити - просто читала і хвилювалася, що дедалі більше сторінок лишаються придавленим великим пальцем лівої руки.Словом, лишається чекати фільму. ""Дівчину в потязі"" покажуть 2017 року, а зараз готуються знімати. Серед тих, хто гратиме у психологічному трилері, - Емілі Блант, Джаред Лето, Джастін Теру. Я уявляю, як хвилюються актори, читаючи сценарій, і думаю: можливо саме зараз хтось із них перегорнув останню сторінку книжку, як це сьогодні зробила я."

“There’s something comforting about the sight of strangers safe at home.”
This is the story of lonely, miserable Rachel (who also happens to have a MAJOR drinking problem).On her daily train commutes to and from London, every time her train stops at a particular signal, she looks out the window at the row of lovely Victorian houses overlooking the tracks.There is one house in particular which catches her fancy, and from her vantage point, she enjoys a perfect view of this house and its inmates and richly imagines their lives, giving them imaginary names, thereby reminiscing the kind of life she once used to have, before it all fell apart.This is the only thing she really has to look forward to everyday, until one day she happens to see something unbelievably shocking and from thereon, things start unraveling.Labeling this book ""the next Gone Girl"" certainly generated a lot of buzz and it soon became the most talked-about book of 2015.As far as the comparisons to Gone Girl are concerned, this book was way better especially in terms of its pace (There were a lot of places in Gone Girl, where I felt things dragged unnecessarily and unbearably).This was a great fast-paced creepy psychological thriller, packed with suspense, mystery and intrigue.And I certainly know what I'm going to vote for in this year's 
Goodreads Choice Awards
! ;)"
90,micki,"While reading this I wasn't sure I'd give this 4 stars (I was thinking maybe 3). The non-linear timeline, the unreliable narrator(s), and the general unlikeability of ALL the characters had me grinding my teeth in frustration. There have been a spate of books in recent years with a similar format so it can feel repetitive and overdone. However, as I forced myself to keep reading I realized that the disjointed narrative resulting from these choices is exactly why these types of stories work, especially in this case. Knowing you can't completely trust the information that each narrator shared keeps the reader off-balance, uncertain if the conclusions being drawn are the right ones. This feeling perfectly matches Rachel's doubts about her own thoughts and memories, and later, Anna's worries. Even though I figured out ""whodunit"" pretty early on I felt compelled to keep reading which, as always, is the sign of a ""good read"" for me.***Oh, and for the reviewers (or readers without reviews) who say this is a book for people who don't read I say, ""hahahahahahahahahaha! good one!"" Whatever, man."
91,Bunny,"I simultaneously effing loved this, and am really disappointed with this. Disappointed because the ending is one of my wild guesses. I hate when my wild guesses are right. Sigh. I love being wrong. But that's probably the most ridiculous complaint ever, right?Especially since I pretty much assumed everyone but the most obvious choice was the killer. It's hard to be wrong when you suspect everybody. Anyway. Now that I've gotten my whining over with. The story is told from the perspective of three people, two of whom I genuinely wanted to crack over the skull with a rock. The third of whom is dead for 3/4 of the book. Let me tell you, this dynamic is deeply unsatisfying. Rachel is possibly the stupidest human ever on the face of the earth, and she never. gets. better. Bad decisions compound more bad decisions, and it just never stops! I was texting my friend Amberly regularly with screams of, ""SHE SLEPT WITH WHAT?!"" ""SHE MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH WHO NOW?!?""Anna can just go die in a fire. 'Cause really. When we first started getting her perspective, I said nooooooooooooow, Bunny, let's not jump to conclusions, we've only gotten STUPID Rachel's opinion on Anna thus far, you are being way too hasty and judgemental. Yeah, hasty and judgemental my ass. Go jump in front of a train, Anna.(view spoiler)[I knew it wasn't Scott. Especially when he started going ape shit. I knew it wasn't the doctor, that wasn't even close to one of my guesses. Pretty early on, I said Tom was having an affair with Megan and killed her for reasons unknown. I also threw out that Anna found out Tom was cheating on her with Megan, and killed her in a jealous rage. I actually would've liked option 2 even better. But Tom always did seem a little shady.Maybe it's because I've been watching The Blacklist and they have a shady Tom on there. I may be racist again Toms right now. But the minute Rachel said Tom was guilty, I decided he wasn't. Because see above re: Rachel is an idiot.Anna overkilling Tom? Probably my favorite part of the entire book. (hide spoiler)]Solid book. Solid, solid. And the narration is done by three British women, including Molly Hooper herself, and all of my thoughts were British and I was disappointed to watch or listen to anything not with a British accent. Always happy times. "
92,Liz,"I feel like a 4 star rating is still very generous. It just reminded me too much of Gone Girl. And since this book was published years after Gone Girl, I have to give this book a lower rating. I noticed countless similarities (the missing woman, the husband who's involuntarily suspicious, the pregnancy or the constant lies of Amy and Tom are just a few examples, I noticed a lot more motives. To be honest, I couldn't think of anything other than ""Gone Girl"" while reading this book)The plot twist didn't evoke any emotions, while I was blown away with the twist and turns of Gone Girl. While I disliked the characters in both of the books, I felt more with the ones in Gone Girl. I fell in love with the imperfections and I was equally as fascinated as I was frustrated by them.I am still rating this book 4 stars, because I would've been much more impressed if I had read this before Gone Girl. I kept me reading (finished it in one night) and the plot would have been great if it wasn't so similar to another one that I have already read about.Usually people are wrong with comparing two books and I'm honestly so tired of every book being compared to The Hunger Games etc. I thought this would be one of those times when a book of a certain genre becomes very popular and people start to use it as a sort of criterion to compare other books of that genre to. But it wasn't.I feel kind of bad for comparing these two books, because you should base your rating on its content but in this case I think it was necessary. They just had too much in common. I still enjoyed it (this the 4 star rating) and maybe I just read it a little too soon while the memory of Gone Girl was still fresh on my mind."
93,Tabatha,"I think comparing this book to Gone Girl really misses the mark. They're both great, but it's like comparing Apples to Oranges. I think it reads more like Before I Go To Sleep. Fast paced thriller with horribly unstable characters makes for a great read. Only 4 stars because for me, by the end of the book it was like someone suddenly slammed on the break and it became predicable. Great read and definitely recommend!"
94,Dark Faerie Tales,"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: A dark and engrossing mystery with a main character that may just grate on some readers’ nerves.Opening Sentence: She’s buried beneath a silver birch tree, down towards the old train tracks, her grave marked with a cairn.The Review:The Girl on the Train is a dark and engrossing mystery with a main character that may just grate on some readers’ nerves. I feel like the less you know about this book going in the better the read will be so I’m going to try to be as vague as possible. The leading protagonist is Rachel. She rides a train every day to London for her job. At the beginning she is a bit of a dreamer, imaging the life of a couple she sees almost every day on her way into work. Until the one day that she sees something so reprehensible that she ends up engrossing herself into the life of the couple.The main thing that you have to know about Rachel is that she is a severe alcoholic. She constantly drinks to excess and has blackouts. There really isn’t much redeemable about her but I found I constantly felt sorry for her even though she keeps putting herself in these situations. Also, it is hard to see her as “reliable” because of her alcoholism.I’d like to say I knew how it would all play out but thankfully I didn’t. I had my own theories that didn’t quite match up. I really enjoyed the Red Herrings that were thrown at me throughout the book especially after reading and then thinking back on it.There were three POV’s, all in the first person. Rachel had the main bulk of the book but you also got insight into two other women’s point of views as the story went along. Make sure you double check the names at the beginning of the chapters, it might throw you off. Each of the chapters were even divided into morning or night with the characters thinking back on the events that happened previously. It was a little different but I think it helped my reading experience flow more quickly.The Girl on the Train is a drastic change from what I normally read and enjoy (Urban Fantasy/Paranormal Romance). It was kind of a nice change. The writing is also a big change from what I’m used to so it felt as though I was reading a literary masterpiece. Although that may be a little drastic of a comparison but I enjoyed the writing style. The beginning of the novel had me hooked because I knew nothing and the little insights that were revealed incrementally kept me engrossed then the middle slowed down a bit and I got really frustrated with Rachel but the ending was worth it. I don’t really want to say there is a twist but there is definitely something going on.This novel was recommended to me by a friend and I am glad I read it. I enjoyed it enough that I would also recommend it but I wouldn’t tell someone that it is the greatest book out there because it really isn’t but it is a good look into the fact that my life could be so much worse.Notable Scene:I am no longer travelling to my imaginary office. I have given up the pretence. I can barely be bothered to get out of bed. I think I last brushed my teeth on Wednesday. I am still feigning illness, although I’m pretty sure I’m fooling no one.I can’t face getting up, getting dressed, getting onto the train, going into London, wandering the streets. It’s hard enough when the sun is shining, it’s impossible in this rain. Today is the third day of cold, driving, relentless downpour.I’m having trouble sleeping, and it’s not just the drinking now, it’s the nightmares. I’m trapped somewhere, and I know that someone’s coming, and there’s a way out, I know there is, I know that I saw it before, only I can’t find my way back to it, and when he does get me, I can’t scream. I try—I suck the air into my lungs and I force it out—but there’s no sound, just a rasping, like a person fighting for air.Sometimes, in my nightmares, I find myself in the underpass by Blenheim Road, the way back is blocked and I cannot go further because there is something there, someone waiting, and I wake in pure terror.FTC Advisory: I borrowed a copy of The Girl on the Train from a friend."
95,Zana Kuhlman,Really good mystery. End came too quick. 
96,Felicity,"In the beginning I didn't like this book, it didn't catch me but when I read more and more I definitely liked it. It's very confusing and you don't know a hundred percent what it will happen in the next chapter. Finally I liked it so much. In conclusion I bought this book for my friend"
97,Kat,"It's more like a 3.5 for me, but I'll give it a 4.Very engrossing and you won't want to put it down once you really get into it. Ending was more satisfying than Gone Girl, but felt rushed. But definitely a good entertaining read. "
98,Gretchen,"I couldn't put this down! I think it's interesting that this book has been hailed as the next Gone Girl because, aside from the genre and plot involving a missing woman, I didn't find it to be THAT similar. Yes, it's very psychological and features an unreliable narrator in Rachel, but Girl on the Train really stands on its own. It reminded me a lot of Rear Window. The quality of the writing also surprised me. Hawkins writes beautifully, and parts of the beginning reminded me a little of Sylvia Plath. I guessed the twist right before it happened, but that didn't really matter. I still enjoyed it quite a bit. The only reason I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars was because I found myself wanting to know more about Anna and Tom as characters. "
99,Monika,"Den här boken la jag för första gången märke till när jag gick igenom vilka böcker som skulle släppas i mars. Av vad jag läste trodde jag att den skulle passa mig väldigt bra. Sedan dök den upp på den ena bokbloggen efter den andra och alla verkade bara tokälska. Vilket fick mig att faktiskt bli mindre sugen på att läsa den, eftersom det alltid är jobbigt att läsa böcker som många läst och lyft till skyarna. Men till slut kunde inte jag heller stå emot.

100,Kay,"I ended up liking this, despite hating all the characters. Maybe the denouement was a bit too tidy, but it was still a compelling story."
101,Ian FH,Enjoyed the audiobook version of this book. Kept me guessing what exactly the outcome would be. 
102,Renee,"Rachel is a lonely alcoholic who enjoys people watching during her daily commute. She particularly likes observing ""Jess"" and ""Jason,"" who she views as a perfect couple with a perfect life. However, one day she sees something surprising through the train window. Although she may be doing more harm than good, Rachel decides to become involved in the ensuing investigation.I always love a good page-turner. ""The Girl on the Train"" focuses on three unhappy, unreliable, and unlikeable women. If you need to like characters in order to enjoy a book, skip this one. The mystery kept me thoroughly engrossed, and I finished the book in about a week. Although I guessed the ending a bit early and sometimes the characters were frustrating, I really enjoyed this overall."
103,Amanda  Cooper,"Strong female characters don't necessarily mean good female characters. They can be weak, but strongly written, vibrant and real and engaging. The three women at the centre of this book are by turns infuriating, pathetic, and heartbreaking. I can't count the number of times I rolled my eyes and grumped ""oh for god's sake Rachel!"". Yet the book was all the more compelling for the characters being so real, and so flawed. "
104,Iuri,"Vamo lá, A Garota no Trem.Eu comecei a ler intensivamente com romances policiais, então esse sempre foi um gênero muito querido pra mim. Isso dito, dá pra dizer que foi uma leitura prazerora.O crime era bem méh, dava pra autora ter feito tanta coisa mais legal com isso, motivo tosquíssimo e mais ou menos na metade do livro já tava meio obvio qual seria a resolução final. Inclusive o final ficou meio aberto pra mim, achei que faltou dar um pouco mais de norte pra Rachel.O que mais gostei, na verdade, e que justifica a quarta estrela, foi a Rachel. Como foi doloroso vê-la se deteriorando com o álcool, querendo parar e não conseguindo, indo sutilmente para a próxima garrafa e prometendo que ia ser a última. Senti muita pena dela e talvez por isso tenha esperado um final mais feliz pra ela.Os outros personagens não me cativaram muito. Megan uma chata, Anna uma ridícula, Tom e Scott idem. Quem mais tinha potencial, o ruivo do trem, não foi bem explorado. Então foi um livro com várias boas oportunidades perdidas."
105,Rachel Watkins,So suspenseful - this was a quick read. It was also devastating due to many unreliable narrators. This is a great escape book if you need a mini vacation from the real world.
106,Bekka,"WOW! What a thrill ride this was. I loved the way the author structured the book, moving the two timelines slowly closer and closer, not revealing the mystery until the two come together. The characters are extremely memorable - Rachel is just brilliant. A fascinating portrayal! This is an adult novel with some disturbing content, but a brilliantly constructed and executed book. For those who enjoy thrillers and mysteries, this is a great read!"
107,Vanessa Montês,"(...)Todas estas mulheres têm algum problema por trás. Todas têm os seus demónios e, apesar de inicialmente se renderem face a estes, acabam por tentar lutar contra eles da melhor forma que sabem.Foi um livro que gostei imenso e com uma reviravolta final de que o leitor começa a desconfiar a determinada altura. Gostei imenso e aconselho sem reservas! Um livro que irá fazer as delicias dos fãs do género. E não se deixem ir abaixo se o início não vos prender, verão que vale a pena.Opinião completa em http://blocodedevaneios.blogspot.pt/2..."
108,Jessyca,"Talk about rising action! Twists and turns, a suspenseful thriller, a page turner. The characters were believable and you couldn't help but feel for them, although they were despicable! Maybe the characters just seemed 'real' with their baggage, hopes, dreams, and delusions. If you liked Gone Girl, you will like this. "
109,Anna  J. Holland,"No estoy muy segura de si he amado este libro locamente o no.Y, ¿cómo se puede dudar algo así? os preguntaréis.Pues bien, la historia en si es... rara. Y quiero decir con esto que es diferente, es hasta morbosa.No es una novela juvenil, tampoco adulta pero tiene esa chispa que mucha novela juvenil no tiene y que, en ocasiones, se agradece.El principio es lento, muy lento. Me costó bastante tiempo engancharme; no hacía más que empezarlo y dejarlo, empezarlo y dejarlo, pero había leído buenas críticas y quería darle una oportunidad me gustase o no.He de decir que absolutamente ningún personaje me ha caído bien; Rachel es medio tonta, Megan otra que tal baila. Pero aún así seguí leyendo.Y menos mal.Llega un momento en la historia que no puedes dejar de pensar que todo el culpa de Rach (#nospoilers) pero no quieres que lo sea porque, en el fondo, te da pena y sabes que si hubieses pasado por lo mismo tampoco dejarías de beber. Y odias a Anna, quieres odiarla, pero tampoco puedes porque sabes que en esa situación estarías igual. Y entonces quieres odiar a Tom, que es un capullo, pero el amor es así.Entonces vuelves a mirar ('mirar' ¿vale?) mal a Rach y quieres odiar al menos a Megan, pero tampoco puedes porque, joder, lo ha pasado mal.Y ya paras de leer, vas a por una tila y bajas a la calle a por el libro que has tirado por la ventana después de tanto estrés (está bien, tranquilos, vivo en un segundo) para aclararte y ver a quién odias más y a quién odias menos, porque al fin y al cabo no se salva nadie.En fin, es un libro lento pero cuando estás llegando al final y empiezas a sacar tus propias conclusiones es hasta interesante. Pero si tienes problemas con la bebida no lo leas. ¿En serio hay latas de gin-tonic? Primera noticia."
110,Janette,"It's as good as the hype. I enjoyed it, though I figured out who done it before it was revealed. The characters were well written and in particular the character of Rachel and her sections of the story put you in her head a little too well. Her scenes felt oppressive at times. "
111,Jeanette,"A very good psychological thriller , kept my interest right to the end. Read it. "
112,Myrna,"WOWZA! The Girl on the Train is a ""who done it"" type of book. It did take me a bit to get into it but once I did, it was hard to put down. The story kept getting crazier the more I continued to read. I have to admit I suspected everyone at one point or another. All three narrators were unhappy, complex and not entirely sympathetic. Basically, they were a a hot mess! This author has a different style than Gillian Flynn. It's a good psychological thriller if that's what you're looking for. I highly recommend it!"
113,Lea Ann,"How do you review a book in which more than 50% of the time you spend inside the head of someone you aren't too keen on? I liked the book. I liked the story. I liked the unfolding of the mystery. But I really didn't like the lead protagonist, Rachel. She's a bit pathetic, and whiny, and crazy. The book opens with Rachel as the narrator. She's sitting on the train. She's watching the homes slide by and she makes up stories about the lives of the people who live within the homes. She has no life of her own. She did, but now she doesn't. She's an alcoholic. She makes terrible choices. She gets drunks and rings her ex-husband. She watches his home from the train like a real voyeur. She injects herself into events that do not concern her to add some interest to her life. And yes, you have to spend endless passages inside this woman's head. It's frustrating. I guess it might be the kind of frustration that comes with living with a real alcoholic. The endless backsliding and promises not to repeat. The next person you spend that much time with is Megan. She's vague and doesn't seem to really do much. She sees a therapist. She's got some issues. She has a confession, a breath catching, eyes starting to water as I listen on my long run, confession. It's heart breaking. I end up liking her despite myself. The last narrator is Anna, the new wife of Rachel's ex. She's irritating and holier than thou, even though she snatched away Rachel's husband and liked it. I liked her even less than Rachel.I think my main problem is that you spend so much time in melancholy with Rachel and Megan that it starts to rub off on you. There's really no joy in the book. So, why did I like the book? The writing is fantastic. The narrative voices of the three main characters are distinct. The plot is great, although it does get a bit slow in some parts. And I liked the mystery aspect to it. "
114,Ishta Mercurio,"I really wish I could give this book 4.5 stars. Did it completely blow my mind? Not quite. The female leads, though well-drawn and real-feeling, were all a bit off-putting, for various personal reasons to do with who they are as characters. (Too whiny, too selfish. All that is very subjective, though. Not something wrong with the novel, just my own response to those characters.) But it's an excellent story, well-told. I couldn't put it down. Highly recommended."
115,Brookedabrowski,"What a fun read! But Girl on the Train is definitely not this summer's Gone Girl as it has so often been billed. That book had a complicated plot hatched by a devious sociopath and it was fun to try to stay a step ahead. Girl on the Train isn't about a plot, it is about the hazy memory of an alcoholic. No brilliant twists, just a slow reclamation of a witnessed scene.Interestingly, it is a book that provokes reflection on a number of smaller issues: Exactly what does a canned gin and tonic taste like? (Sounds pretty good actually and highly potent). What's up with the divorce laws in England? Why and how does the philanderer get to keep everything in its place (including the favorite chair and all of the cutlery) while the betrayed wife gets the clothes on her back? What is the source of Cathy's compassion and support. (She's the most ethical and potentially interesting of the characters, but is barely developed). Has Rachel always had such a weak stomach or is it the booze? Why does she so seldom clean up after herself? What makes so many of them men such slobs, particularly when they have invested in expensive homes?Read this book on the beach and enjoy."
116,Kersh228,"I read this book in two nights. It is an easy, fast paced read. "
117,Nita Dembla,"I think the book starts off really well and builds up a good plot. The characters in the book are depressed, insecure and have variety of psychological issues. Halfway through the story does get repetitive though and stretched, some characters seem useless to the storyline and others seem to have similar psychological traits! All in all, it was a good read but could have been shorter and more focused."
118,Connie Braseth,"Daaaaaaammmn. This is one messed up group of people whose lives are portrayed in this book. I have to admit, it's a pretty clever concept for a whodunit. Page turning chick lit. Yep, that's it. "
119,Irene," Wow! This was a crazy train ride! It is in my favourite format - different P.O.V.s with flashbacks, so I was on board right from the start!  Usually, I have a whodunit theory but this time I had no idea. I will not say more - no spoilers!"
120,Dale Zawada,"I'm an American male in my thirties so you'd think a story about crazy British ladies who drink too much might not go over well with me, but it did.I enjoyed the characters. This is a character story. They're all very flawed but have their own charms. The decisions they make are true to their characters and it's fun to see certain characters interact with each other.The story went on a little too long, but not by much. At a certain point you figure out where the story is going and you're just waiting for the characters to catch up. That can be frustrating but luckily this story doesn't make you wait too long.I liked how even though our main character is a boozehound we never go with her to the bars or experience her getting wasted. It's always right before or after and it begins to feel that this is just how she is. It would be like wasting paper to describe a character breathing, it's assumed. As is Rachel's drinking. I liked that.I listened to the audiobook and the voice actors did a great job. I would suggest the audiobook if you're on the fence on how you want to take the story in."
121,Radhika,A good debut book by Paula HawkinsRachel takes the same train everyday morning and night and the train halts everyday where she can see the street and houses on that street where she had lived with her ex-husband Tom. She cannot get over that their marriage is over. She takes to alcohol to dull the pain that she cannot have a child. She sees a couple some houses down the street she lived and they seem to be so much in love! Her ex still lives in the same house with his new wife and a baby daughter and the thought really kills Rachel.Rachel watches a couple everyday on their deck having their morning coffee when the train stops at the signal and they seemed to be having a wonderful relationship. She gives them imaginary names and tries to fathom how good their life must be. Until she sees something for a second before the train moves one day and changes the whole course of her future in a way she never imaginedThe book keeps you guessing and one can never imagine how the different characters are drawn together is this drama which comes to a surprising end. It is dark and gripping and it sometimes makes you wonder whether the author tried hard to get every character together in a very unrealistic scenario. But a good read!
122,Faye,"4.5 stars. I really enjoyed this. I solved the mystery pretty early on, but I liked the way it was revealed piece by piece and out of chronological order. Excellent use of unreliable narrators. Mostly, though, this book confirms for me my reasons for never ever drinking alcohol. I mean, seriously. Nothing but trouble comes of it."
123,Ursula,"Captivating read. Unlike all of the declarations, this book is not like ""Gone Girl."" This author has written a completely different ""whodunnit"" with a twist. The only spoiler-like comment I will make is that the writing is so good that I wanted to clock the main character several times throughout the story. "
124,Marissa,"4* for it's genre -- a beach read & a mystery. It's fun & quickly paced, forcing you to keep turning pages quickly. It was addicting & a nice distraction. I have no doubt my book club will find things to talk about, as per usual. ;)"
125,Marguarite Markley,just the right amount of crazy to keep me reading
126,Aleena,This book hooked me from the first page. It was fast paced book with a good plot. All along the novel I wanted a character to root for but nah! I ended up getting angry and frustrated at each of them. I keep reading that it is similar to gone girl and having read both of these I'd like to point out that they are quite different from each other. Gone girl gives out stronger vibes and shakes you whereas you only pity the characters in the girl on the train. 
127,Sarah Baumert,Very interesting book! I always love books that make you think you understand everything and then at the end make you realize you didn't understand a thing!
128,Judy Collins,"GIRL ON THE TRAIN-- a deliciously haunting psychological thriller by British journalist Paula Hawkins, --an inventive debut and exploration of obsession, love, violence, secrets, lies, and betrayal.Told from alternating perspectives of three women: Rachel is “the girl on the train.”  She is her 30s, divorced, unemployed, and an alcoholic. She rides the train every day into London so the friend she is staying with will not notice she has no job. On her daily commute into London from the suburbs, the train often stops near Rachel’s old house, where she lived with her former husband, Tom. From her train window, she imagines a happy life as she gazes into the yards and windows of her former neighbors. She is childless, lonely, and buries herself in a bottle (her life is a total train wreck). Rachel dislikes Anna who is married to her ex-husband Tom. She dreams of a perfect life. She resents their life (the life which should have been hers), with husband and baby. On the route, she passes this house and sees this loving couple she calls Jason and Jess, as imagines their happy life. Until one day she sees the woman kissing another man and then her fantasy world is crushed. Then she realizes the woman is missing and learns their true identity. She gets the police involved and the drama begins.What is real and what is an illusion? Due to her blackouts, is she a credible witness?Anna, is married to Rachel’s ex-husband, Tom and they have a baby. Rachel is envious of Anna, as she wanted to have a baby but Tom said they could not afford all the fertility tests. Anna is very self-centered, and preferred the glamour and intrigue of being the other woman. Rachel often stalks them, sneaking into their house and trying to take their baby. Tom and Anna thinks Rachel has lost it, as Rachel is drunk most of the time and does not recall things she has done --blacks out. Megan, is Anna’s neighbor and Rachel has an obsession with Megan and her husband Scott, whose house she passes every day on her train into London. (She imagined them as originally as, Jason and Jess). Megan's part flashes back in time prior to her disappearance. She's manic, but hasn't quite come to terms with two extremely tragic events in her past. Anna, meanwhile, just wants a quiet, picket-fence kind of existence with Tom and their child. She's grown to hate Rachel, who's having a hard time leaving their family alone, with continuous stalking. Now, what you have here  is a mix of stalker, alcoholic, demented, dark, lonely, violent, self-absorbed, obsessive, compulsive, addictive, insecure, jealous, and selfish wacky women who have no life. (Hilarious, right)?  However, Hawkins keeps you hooked as you hear from each woman—as a reader, you want to murder all of them.The shocking and gripping thriller delivers many twists and turns, taking you on a dark engrossing ride-- Rachel blacks out, someone is a murderer, and someone is lying. A fine line between love and hate, this drama will have you racing to the end to learn the fate of these three women and how they are connected. Oh, and the men in their lives who are not as they seem. A page-turner, to learn the identity of the master manipulator. I listened to the audiobook, narrated by Clare Corbett, Louise Brealey, and India Fisher, keeping the suspense high with different voices. At times I wanted to smack these women and became patient with them; however, I enjoyed The Girl on the Train, more than Gone Girl but less than The Good Girl. Hawkins explores highly-charged psychological, social, and contemporary topics of abuse (physical, verbal, and emotional), as well as addictions. She examines middle class women's lives from different perspectives as wives, mothers, divorced, childless, and the mistress' views --how each personality views a situation or person, differently.Get on board the crazy train, for hours of humor and entertainment, as Hawkins cleverly weaves emotional, dark, and complex --with extensive character studies and insights. If you enjoy dark psycho-thrillers, this one is for you! Looking forward to more from this highly creative author, and the movie. Enjoyed reading her inspiration behind the novel, and her thought process for the character development.  Judith D. Collins Must Read Books "
129,Kelsey,Definitely kept my attention even though I loathed most of the characters. 
130,Once Upon A Twilight,"The Girl on The Train by British author Paula Hawkins, is a novel that debuted number one on the New York Times Fiction Best Sellers 2015. It has been compared many times to the book, and subsequent movie, Gone Girl by American author Gillian Flynn. Although I can see some similarities in theme of a darker, more twisted plot and context, I genuinely feel the similarities are like comparing apples and oranges. Yes, they are both fruit, but they both have very different tastes, textures and looks. The Girl on The Train is about a thirty something year old woman named Rachel who rides the commuter train daily to London. During her ride, as she watches out the window, she always notices the back of a particular set of row houses at one of the stops along her way. One of the homes belongs to her ex-husband, where she used to live with him before he left her for his current wife, Anna. Another house a few doors down belong to a couple she doesn’t know, but whom she always sees outside on their back porch, and she takes an almost obsessive interest in them. She creates names for them (she refers to them as Jess and Steve) and a complete back story of what she believes their lives together must be like. You definitely get a sense right away that Rachel is very lonely and deeply affected by the affair her ex-husband had on her with his current wife (who now lives in her old home with him and their new baby), but where things get even more intricate to the plot is that we learn early on that Rachel is an alcoholic and was actually fired from her job months prior to the opening of the story for being drunk at work. She rides the train daily as a way to hide her job loss from her roommate. One day Rachel sees something significant in regards to “Jess” as her train passes the row houses, and later when news reports reveal that “Jess”, who is really named Megan (her husband’s name is really Scott) has gone missing, Rachel emerges herself into the situation to try and help find her because she feels a real, rather inexplicable, connection with this woman. The real interesting twists and turns in this story relate back to Rachel’s alcoholism. A lot of things she sees or remembers, or doesn’t remember for that matter, have to be taken with a grain of salt because we don’t know what is real and what is actually inaccurate do to her being intoxicated the majority of the time. There are a lot of holes in her memory due to black outs and that makes the whole unfolding of this plot, the twists and turns, and the mystery so intriguing. At times, even aside from her intoxication, I found myself wondering if she was actually mentally ill. You really want to pull for her because she is for all proses the story’s heroine, and is the main character, but you just don’t know what is real and what isn’t.There is also a lot of side plot in regards to her ex-husband, his new wife, and how that whole situation affected Rachel and ties into her current situation, and the situation with the missing woman, Megan. The way Paula Hawkins tied all this together was pure brilliance. Every other chapter of this “What happened?” and “Who may have done it?” kept me changing my mind constantly. I never had a direct “I figured it out!” moment until the very end. The only thing I can say that was a negative was in the beginning, until you really figure out who is who amongst the characters, it gets a little confusing because the author switches points of view each chapter (and the fact that Rachel makes up names for two of the characters in the beginning doesn’t help with the confusion of keeping things straight). Also each chapter takes place on different dates. So the dates jump from past to present and then back again throughout the book. That was a little hard to keep straight for me at first, but once I got into the story, and all of the characters were sorted out in my mind, I was completely sucked in and couldn’t put it down. I highly recommend this book and I give it 5 Stars! It’s an easy read length wise, too, so it’s a perfect book to read on vacation or on lunch breaks. The movie rights were already purchased by Dreamworks in 2014 and actress Emily Blunt is in talks to play the leading role of Rachel. If people want to compare this book to Gone Girl then I can only say that with the success of that movie, I think this movie will do the same. So definitely jump on it now before the movie comes out!http://www.onceuponatwilight.com/2015..."
131,Rebecca Mackay,I thought this was a fantastic book. I figured out the ending before it happened but it was very interesting and suspenseful. You sympathize with Rachael and what she is going through. 
132,Helen,"I feel like listening to this book rather than reading it really added to my enjoyment of the story. The narrators are all good, but Clare Corbett, who does the bulk of the performance is spectacular. Her performance allows the listener to experience everything right along with the character. When she panics, you panic, when she's angry you're angry, and when she's feeling lost and alone, you feel the same thing. "
133,Steph,"I'm not sure quite what to say about ""Girl on the Train"". If you like thrillers, there is a reason it's a bestseller. I liked it"
134,Kattie,"A Cautionary tale about matrimonial infidelity, alcohol abuse and domestic violence. Recommended to anyone who is not depressed and looking for a thought-provoking, mind-blowing story that resembles life too much. Overall this book is worth reading."
135,Ifeoma," 4.5 Stars I started reading this book last night before sleep, and finished it this morning. And what can I say, I want to read more thrillers after this. Plot: I went into this aware of the similarities with Gone Girl, and sincerely hoped she wouldn't pull a similar twist on us midway. Without spoiling things, all I can say now is that this was a unique read, and I didn't see the big reveal coming. Not until it was close. The pacing was a bit slow in the sense that it allowed me to anticipate it before the big reveal. But I was still shocked in spite of it. One thing I found fault with earlier, but later stopped finding fault with, was Rachel's problem with alcoholism and her retrograde amnesia. I felt those black outs were convenient for the plot, but the more the plot unfolded, the more I became sure that it was actually ingenious on the part of the author, being able to use that so well and how it actually fit into the plot. Rachel's alcoholism tied in well with her past, and the present. Overall, I have no complaints about the pacing, it is a unique novel because the pacing was a bit slow (sometimes, it seemed nothing was really happening for a stretch, and I expected more leads, more findings, more police investigations etc) but still intriguing enough that I couldn't even have breakfast until I finished it.Characters: The story was told from the POVs of three women, each of them flawed, with Rachel being the most disturbing personality to me. I found her weakness pitiable and very annoying sometimes, but I was glad that her character arc underwent a transformative arch (even if it's temporary, who knows?) to become strong and assertive at the end. An unsung female character that I really loved in the book was Cathy, how she supported Rachel in spite of Rachel's sickening alcoholism, the true example of female friendship. There were also three men in the book, four if you counted the red haired man on the train, all of them flawed. I would have loved if we got more glimpse into Kamal's life though. Overall, this was a great read and I definitely see myself reading more thrillers in the near future."
136,Bobbi,A well written mystery. Kept you guessing until the end although a little slow in parts.
137,Jami,The last ten pages are worth reading the other 315. Good read!
138,Ivy Bagnall,"This is a great book. I couldn't put it down. Read it in a few days, which is rare for me. It was a bit predictable toward the end and, although a good ending, not a happy one. Not for me anyway."
139,Irina,"Quite easy to guess the conclusion of the book, not as thrilling as I was expecting. But, even so, I liked Paula Hawkins' writing. This is a good psychological thriler. I liked the characters, but I couldn't get very attached to them some how. I feel like some characters were extra just to fill some pages and to explain some situations- like Cathy, Rachel's roommate. Cathy was also the only sane character, it seemed.The book is written from the perspective of the three main female characters - Rachel, the alcoholic ex wife, Meghan, the missing protagonist, and Anna - the new wife of Tom, Rachel's ex husband.Many plots and twists ensue."
140,Cardmaker,"When I started the book, I wasn't paying close attention to the chapter headings which are important, very important. They tell you when the events are happening. Once I figured out that the author was skipping back and forth between the past, the present and the future, I could follow the story a lot easier.The story is narrated by three women. You'll easily be able to keep their stories separate although their lives do intertwine in strange ways.I don't want to say too much because it's too easy to write spoilers. It's a good story, very well told and I'd recommend it."
141,Cindy Coull,Great book !!!
142,Suzie Grogan,"Although none of the characters in this book isbterribly likeable, by the end of a thrilling ride the fragility of at least two is explained and the psychological background that is more than hinted at by the conclusion makes you shudder at your earlier responses to them. A clever thriller, which might be compared to Gone Girl (unreliable narrators aplenty here) but which I enjoyed rather more, set as it is in a suburban Britain well known for hiding all sorts of nastly little secrets..."
143,Carrie Hunsucker,Page turner. Contrived ending.
144,PorshaJo,"What a ride. I have been in such a reading slump. Working like crazy and hardly any time to read. When I did have time, I just could not get into anything. I must have started about 15 or more books reading numerous pages and just giving up. Then I picked up The Girl on the Train. I was immediately hooked. I couldn't put it down. I stayed up late reading it, read it during making dinner, practically tuned my husband out so I could just read a bit more. I would tell anyone I talk to to read this one. I would give it more of a 4.5. Not a 5 because I would not read it again....because I know what happens. :-) I look forward to reading more from this author in the future. I see that it now to be made into a movie and I'll be interested to see what they do with this book. I will not give a synopsis of the book as its been done so much already. I will just say this is a must read for those who love a good thriller."
145,Brie Peters,I've never read a book so fast! Couldn't put it down. 
146,Angela Meadon,I really enjoyed The Girl on the Train.It's very cleverly written and Hawkins weaves many strands together into a gorgeous tapestry. Very satisfying ending.
147,Camillia Dass,"REVIEW ORIGINALLY POSTED HERE: TWENTY THREE OWLS I love people-watching. There's just something so captivating about making up this whole life for someone else based only upon what you see in front of you. I decided to read this little thriller mainly because pretty much everyone was reading it and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I'm pleased to say that all the fuss is correct. This is one damn good book. I loved the grittiness of it. I loved how raw it was and how it stole your breath away when you least expected it.Paula Hawkins basically makes you hate all the characters. She makes everyone a suspect. Every one including the baby.""But where was the baby?""I'm just kidding.It was such a refreshing change to see characters that were so messed up and unlovable. I guess that's why it has been compared to Gillian Flynn's 'Gone Girl' a lot. I absolutely hated every character with a vengeance. I would find myself standing in the shower sometimes and I would be thinking of the characters and having this huge ranting session in my head about why they are douchebags. Then I would leave the shower, pulsing with fury only to pick up book again because I had to know what happened.This story is told from the point of view of three highly unreliable and unstable narraters. You never know who is telling the truth, who is lying and who simply cannot for the life of her remember what happened. Rachel is the forgetful alcoholic, Anne is the lying second wife and Megan is the neurotic cheat. They have all been robbed of the fullness of life and they are all grieving for what could have been. Together they work to bring three lives together into the big mystery of what happened on Saturday night. Everyone keeps secrets. Everyone.The reason why this book didn't get the full 5 stars from me was because I felt like the conclusion was weak. I didn't like how the book ended. I felt like it was overly dramatic. But that's the only flaw I could find. Now go out there and get your hands on this book because it is one hell of a good story."
148,Jessica Spunberg,"Like Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins explores the dark, dark, DARK - through the inner workings of an incredibly *complex* woman. In this case, it's a trio of very different, but equally compelling and unpredictable, women. And, like Gone Girl, I read the entire book in a single sitting. Rachel Watson, our divorced, alcoholic protagonist, fulfills the role of unreliable narrator as a lonely London commuter with a vivid imagination. Each day, twice a day, her slow-moving train lumbers past the affluent, tree-lined neighborhood where she used to live with her ex-husband, and where she spots and imagines a perfect life for a neighboring golden couple, whom she refers to as ""Jason and Jess."" And the mystery begins. As a voyeur who has frequent blackouts and admits she doesn't even trust herself, Rachel is at once a sympathetic character who, at the same time, can't fully be trusted.Without giving away too much of the plot, the novel's trio of narrators helps add to the suspense -- just when you start getting acquainted with one character, you realize that you might be hearing the thoughts of someone evil - or someone who is no longer alive by book's end. Consequently, readers will have a hard time resisting a race through the chapters.Unlike Gone Girl, The Girl On the Train has none of the dark humor, aside from perhaps a biting satirical commentary on the banality of the suburbs, particularly for stay-at-home moms -- referred to several times as the ""Pilates/Starbucks/Book Club"" posse. And motherhood is surely a motif, if not a heavy-handed one, running through the book. Overall, this novel instantly strikes a dissonant tone, creates a somber, lonesome and desperate mood, and offers up dark, haunting detail -- and in Rachel, introduces a character not soon to be forgotten. It's practically a sure thing that this book will be swiftly snatched up by Hollywood, following the same award-winning path as its Gillian Flynn-penned predecessor. "
149,Susie,"Wow what an exhausting roller coaster!I have to admit there is a lot to work through in your mind while reading this book. Once you get your mind wrapped around the different characters, their POV's and the past/ present timelines it is quite the ride. The writing style in this book reminds me of Gone Girl .... there are parts that seem to drag a bit due to the level of detail, but in the end you realize the detail is required in order for the story to come together. I enjoyed this twisted read:)"
150,Encruzilhadas Literárias,"Já tive oportunidade de dizer anteriormente, mas volto a reforçar, que fico sempre um pouco de pé atrás quando surgem comparações entre livros ou sugestões do género ""para fãs de..."". A ""Rapariga do Comboio"" tem sido bastante recomendada a quem gostou de ""Em Parte Incerta"" de Gillian Flynn, livro que não me cativou de todo. De qualquer forma, continuava curiosa com a sinopse apresentada, pelo que não pude deixar de aproveitar a oportunidade criada pela Topseller, que cedeu ao blog um exemplar avançado para leitura e opinião honesta antes do lançamento oficial do livro (gesto pelo qual estamos gratas!).Terminada a leitura, posso dizer que este livro é de facto para os fãs da Gillian, mas também para os que não gostaram das suas obras. Melhor que isso, ""A Rapariga no Comboio"" é para os fãs da Paula Hawkins!Para quem realiza diariamente viagens mundanas de comboio, é perceptível o fascínio com este modo de transporte e para a certa nuance mágica que lhe surge associada. Foi também esse embalo inicial que criou uma ligação de empatia com Rachel, a personagem que me acompanhou ao longo de mais de 300 páginas. Esta personagem é bastante peculiar, pelo grau de complexidade que lhe é atribuído mas também pela facilidade de acesso às diversas camadas que a compõem, e que vão sendo reveladas em diversos momentos da obra, intercalados de forma engenhosa para inebriar o leitor e deixá-lo com várias suspeitas e muito poucas certezas. Perdida, com instintos acertados, vários questionamentos justificados e uma série de momentos que até poderiam ser considerados hilariantes, não fosse uma clara análise individual e social da sua condição, esta Rapariga que viaja diariamente de Comboio foi uma surpresa constante e pela qual dei por mim a torcer, mesmo nos momentos em que ela não merecia. Aliás, estava tão concentrada nela nas primeiras páginas que só ao fim de quatro capitulos me apercebi que o livro é contado sob dois pontos de vista, pelas mãos de Rachel e Megan (obrigando-me a recomeçar para me posicionar correctamente). Parecendo uma enorme distração da minha parte, a verdade é que as histórias diferenciadas sobrepõem postos de construção. As duas personagens confluem na sua essência em algumas coisas, pelo que criam uma voz comum entre ambas, sem lhes negar uma personalidade forte e vincada. As duas estão condoídas com preâmbulos da vida, fragilizadas, marcadas por arrependimentos e cenários mais cinzentos, e procuram qualquer coisa, mesmo que não saibam que o fazem ou o que pretendem de facto. São muito vívidas, destacando-se pela forma transformadora como se envolvem com as restantes personagens secundárias e que criam uma rede de tensões, suspeita, suspense e mistério que agarra qualquer leitor até à última página. A acção está enquadrada de uma forma engenhosa, apoiando-se num estilo de escrita bastante lúcido, que se entranha, e que nos faz querer avançar para a próxima página, descobrindo as consequências de cada passo dado pelas personagens (de forma acertada ou não) ao longo de um jogo de incerteza e porque não, de sobrevivência.Rachel e Megan levam-nos para uma viagem constante entre o presente o passado, pelo constraste do mundo idealizado e das transformações aparentes que podem acontecer com um piscar de olhos (ou com um comboio parado ao pé de um sinal por breves minutos). A análise que estas mulheres proporcionam ao leitor está sempre em mutação, seja pela apresentação de detalhes singulares, por uma frase dita aparentemente sem significado, por uma revelação inesperada ou pela necessidade constante de o colocar a tentar adivinhar os seus próximos passos.É essencialmente um jogo intelectual, à altura de um thriller de mão cheia, que se entranha na mente de quem o lê até que todas peças encaixem e façam sentido novamente. E embora não componha um cenário tão perturbador como o prometido, numa lógica de constrastes visuais, ""A Rapariga no Comboio"" faz-nos certamente pensar se a parte mais arrepiante das nossas vidas não será o facto de nunca conseguirmos conhecer/prever realmente o comportamento de alguém. Nem o do vizinho do lado, nem das pessoas com quem partilhamos laços afectivos, nem de quem nos vê do outro lado do espelho.Não percam a oportunidade de lançar a mão a este livro, que será editado em Portugal a 8 de Junho pela Topseller (edição: o lançamento foi adiantado para 5 de junho)! - Cláudia"
151,Jackie Watts,"A very enjoyable read. I am not sure that I would describe this book as a thriller, even though there is a mystery and a degree of suspense. It is very character-driven and the ending is much more ""well that makes sense"" rather than ""whoah! didn't see that coming"".There are three narrators - two very messed up, one rather vacuous and frankly not very nice - and whether you enjoy the story may depend to a great extent on how sympathetic you find them. This is not a book for those who like uncomplicated characters who think about very little other than their hair! Personally I thought they were honestly depicted, frustrating but still (in 2 cases out of 3) likeable and I couldn't put the book down until I had found out what happened to them! "
152,Dominique (Dom),Different kind of thriller. Intriguing sometimes weird but in a good way!
153,Carla,"Não posso dizer que achei este livro brilhante, que o considere uma obra-prima ou que o vá ler outra vez.Mas uma coisa não nego, prendeu-me a atenção e a curiosidade do início ao fim e não consegui parar de lê-lo, porque a autora conseguiu imprimir-lhe uma aura de mistério e de ""suspense"" quase até ao seu final.O livro, além de ser uma espécie de policial, em que se deseja muito avançar para descobrir quem foi o autor do assassínio de uma jovem mulher atormentada pelo passado, fala-nos de outros temas interessantes, como a fragilidade da vida, das relações humanas e da decadência da sociedade moderna:1. A maioria das pessoas, mesmo com vidas estáveis (casamentos mais ou menos felizes, amigos e profissões de que gostam), podem, em determinadas circunstâncias em que se encontram mais fragilizadas, cair numa espiral de auto-destruição, onde se perde tudo, depois de se refugiarem no álcool ou em outros vícios.2. A maioria de nós também pensa que a vida dos outros é sempre mais perfeita que a nossa.3. Quantos de nós, que andamos de comboio, de autocarro ou até a pé, sentimos curiosidade em espreitar para a casa e para a intimidade dos outros, imaginando como será a vida dessas pessoas.4. Quantos de nós, somos alvo ou somos os próprios sujeitos de juízos de valor sobre o que deve ser uma vida perfeita e aceitável de acordo com as convenções sociais vigentes, que, quer queiramos, quer não, se impõem sobretudo às mulheres adultas, as quais, só podem ser felizes ou bem sucedidas, se forem casadas, se tiverem filhos, se forem boas profissionais, se forem atraentes e bem-dispostas. Se se está triste e se não se reunir estas condições, é porque se falhou.Deste modo, muitos passam a vida a fingir perante os outros e, sobretudo, perante si próprios, o que aconteceu nos relacionamentos sobre que trata o livro, em que as personagens não conheciam verdadeiramente com quem estavam casadas.Gostei da personagem principal, Rachel, a ex-mulher alcoólica, deprimida, solitária, desempregada, que observava e imaginava a vida de um casal jovem no jardim da sua casa, nas viagens que diariamente fazia de comboio, pois preocupava-se com os outros, e porque, apesar dos constantes erros que cometia, era muito humana, sensível e verdadeira.Gostei da circunstância deste livro ter sido narrado, de forma intercalada, por três mulheres distintas, mas com relações entre si, que expunham as suas visões diferentes sobre os mesmos acontecimentos.Finalmente, gostei de uma personagem secundária, a Cathy, que, apesar de não ter sido dada muita relevância à mesma, até pela própria Rachel, que não a via como uma amiga próxima, esta última só não se afundou mais, porque aquela, enquanto sua senhoria e amiga, nunca a chegou a expulsar de casa e tentou ajudá-la de diversas formas.É também um erro frequente que muitos cometem, não dar relevo a pessoas que acham ser desinteressantes e insignificantes, e que menosprezam, mas que são importantes, porque se sobrevalorizamos uns, estamos totalmente desatentos em relação a outros. "
154,Hannah Hillman,"As much as I hate to compare this to Gone Girl, it's practically inevitable. Both novels alternate narrators in the same diary-entry format. Both feature bad marriages, a dead female and surrounding criminal investigation, and shady characters who you can't trust. Despite all these similarities, I still enjoyed Gone Girl more than The Girl on the Train. I found Amy Dunne was far deeper and more compelling than any of the characters in this novel. She is a twisted mastermind whose narration is thrilling to read, whereas the characters in The Girl on the Train were a bit stereotypical (alcoholic divorced wife whose life is a mess, bitter new wife who is jealous of husband's connection with ex, manipulative husband who can't stop cheating and lying, etc). The plot twists in The Girl on the Train were somewhat predictable and less surprising to me as well. That being said, I still enjoyed the book and liked its fast paced plot."
155,Jann Barber,"The Girl on the Train is Paula Hawkins’ debut thriller, and it provides quite a ride! Whose story is reliable? Is anyone’s story reliable? This is told from the points of view of Megan, Anna, and Rachel, and is also told from a period of time in 2013, with a few flashbacks to 2012.Rachel’s life has fallen apart. Her marriage has dissolved, she has a drinking problem, often experiencing blackouts, and she has lost her job. To keep her roommate from learning this, Rachel continues to take the train daily, as if going to work. The train consistently stops at particular spots along the line; one of these happens to be a house near the one where Rachel lived when she was married. It is there that she sees a happily married couple who she names Jason and Jess, and she looks forward to seeing them on her way to and from the city each day.Meanwhile, Rachel continues to contact her ex-husband, Tom, who has married Anna and now has a baby girl. Rachel’s contacts feel like harassment to Anna, but Tom continues to assure Anna that he is handling the situation.One day, Rachel sees something that causes her to escalate her intrusion into the lives of her ex-husband and his wife, and also brings her into the lives of “Jason” and “Jess” when Jess disappears.This was a gripping read, and I enjoyed the cat-and-mouse aspects of the story. I also learned that an alcoholic blackout is not a condition where the drinker forgets events. This type of blackout occurs because when highly intoxicated, the brain can’t create short-term memories and therefore, there is nothing to remember the next day.Rachel’s behaviors may seem too crazy to be believed, but if she is an alcoholic and feels as if her life has spiraled out of control, her poor decisions seemed appropriate to me as a reader."
156,Tracie (March Hare) ,"This book evoked such a strong reaction in me. My heart raced and I felt fear for the characters. I had strong feelings for each of them especially Anna. But by the end I wasn't sure how I felt towards any of them, they were real to me, human. This book showed me what others will do for survival and for maintaining the status quo. It read a little like a lifetime movie and was slow towards the beginning. The ending too, though I didn't figure it out right away, seemed sort of predictable in a lifetime sort of way. (Truly no offense to those who enjoy those movies). But those are the only reasons I gave it one star less."
157,daniel,"pontuação: 3.5 estrelas.o ambiente criado pela autora à base do comboio e das casas que a protagonista ""admirava"" foi bastante giro, eu gostei bastante disso.as personagens também foram todas bem criadas.à parte disso, não acho que tenha gostado tanto como toda a gente. talvez por não estar no melhor mood de leitura ou as expectativas serem muito altas mas não achei tão arrebatador quanto isso.[spoilers]o facto do thriller se basear na relação da megan e do tom não me ""caiu muito bem"". i mean, aquilo surgiu basicamente do nada e talvez por isso seja considerado imprevisivel. não há, ao longo do livro, qualquer pista para uma possivel relação de ambos. ela não estava interessada no kamal (se não estou em erro no nome)? então, de onde surgiu o tom?[spoilers]"
158,You By,"Paula Hawkins isn’t an author I have read. The book was bought for me at Christmas for its reviews of being a bestselling thriller. I got the hardback edition with black binding and it felt and looked the part. At first it was slow. I started reading around mid-afternoon, and by 5 o’clock I was half way through the book and completely engaged. I read the whole book by 11pm and couldn’t put it down. I found that the descriptions of people, places and timelines were so detailed I could have been part of the story, and it could have been real life. The book is written in an almost diary from taking you along the timelines of Megan, Anna and Rachel, with their lives intertwining at points throughout the book. But it’s not until the very end that you really find out how all of these stories work together. Personally I would say this is a mild thriller, it is no Stephen King, but it isn’t trying to be. It’s a relatively easy read which is why I was able to finish it so quickly. The only thing I wish this book had more of was an ending, it feel quite abrupt which I wasn’t expecting. But that fact in no way changes my attitude towards this book. A thoroughly enjoyable read, that is highly recommended, and rightly so. Live Love Laugh FPhttps://youbyyou.wordpress.com/ - FOR MORE REVIEWS AND BLOGS!"
159,Eugenia (Genie In A Book),"This is the kind of thriller which sits among the other prominent pieces of domestic noir like Gone Girl, and yet presents a different kind of suspense. It'll definitely keep you guessing and reading long into the night just so you can see how it all could possibly end. Though the 'big reveal' is not as shocking as some I've come across, the dawning realisation of it all actually makes a good fit for a story that creeps up on you as the pages keep turning, almost by themselves. The hype that has surrounded this novel for a long while now I feel is justified, so now I'm looking for another thriller that will truly surprise me!"
160,Dean Turnbloom,"I'd seen this book on the shelf at my local Barnes & Noble many times and had even picked it up to read the interior book liner notes and found it to be high on my list of ""want to read""s and then I received a signed copy of the book for Christmas. I was enthusiastic. But I soon found myself knee-deep in estrogen. Turns out all the POV's in the book are female. I'm not saying this is bad, only unusual. Of course I'd read books with a woman's POV before, Agatha Christie books come to mind, but this one had three POV's, all female, and it shifted from one to the other. At first I found it annoying, but there was something fascinating as well.And then there was the shifting. For the most part it was chronological, but there was one POV, the victim's, that of course wasn't chronologically aligned with the others. It was, within itself chronological, but it played out on a separate timeline than the others.But I have to admit the book was quite good. I found myself caught up with both the characters--all of whom are flawed in some way--and the style. I began to wonder how Ms Hawkins wrote the book. What I envisioned was her writing the story through from each POV and then breaking them up and interweaving them. As a writer myself, I found this most intriguing. Of course it's probably not how she did it at all. It's the way I would have done it, had I thought of it.Bottom line is that this book is an excellent read, from characterizations and scene setting to include sensory cues, as well as plot. I would very much recommend it to anyone--even though it's decidedly told from a female perspective."
161,Donna Liberman,"Hmmmm. Let me start first by saying that I would definitely recommend this book. It's clever, the characters are well drawn, and the general premise is great. Having said that, here are my issues: 1) the first quarter of the book is backstory and set-up. Nothing really happens except that Rachel rides on a train and describes what she sees. 2) I really didn't connect with any of the characters. I pitied or loathed them. 3) does a born liar really come clean when he doesn't even need to, with little prompting? The murderer all of a sudden has the most honest moment of his life at the end of the book when he would most likely tell the biggest lie of his life. Whaaat? Not only does he spill, but it's a long retelling of every step that occurred leading to the murder. It didn't fit his character. 4) readers are misled by the publisher that this is a novel with an unreliable narrator. The narrators are all reliable. They all tell their version of the story as it happened. The reader puts her own ideas (drunks can't be trusted, emotionally screwed up people can't be trusted, etc) into the characters' stories and that is not the definition of an unreliable narrator. Having said all of that, I still think it was an enjoyable read."
162,Jeanne,"Okay, so it's not LITERATURE writ large, but with three unreliable female narrators, this whodunit had me riveted to the story. I can't remember when I last finished a book in less than 24 hours...."
163,Stitchylinda,"I liked this book. Right from the start, I was fascinated by Rachel's inner voice and her take on things around her - absolutely cringeworthy. Some people claim they saw the ending coming a mile off, but I didn't until three quarters of the way through and thought it was a really well-developed plot. Loved the unreliable narrator/s approach - trust no-one! Finished the book in two days."
164,Kellie,"I was pleasantly surprised by this book. I had no expectations for it but a bunch of the ladies I work with were reading it so I said why not. They all finished before me, however once you get into the book it's not hard to see why it was read so quickly. The storyline is fast paced and keeps you thinking. I would definitely recommend this book!"
165,Bea Trisha,"4.5 starsall the twists are good..i just felt it's too long, tho."
166, Julie,"An edge of your seat thriller! I would have rated it 4.5 stars if that was possible. I did the audible version and the readers were very good!, I don't usually do audible but my eyes needed a rest and my ears needed some good entertainment! Kind of Hitchcock intrigue "
167,Kinyorda Sliwiak,"It is possible to dislike every character in a book and still be sucked in by great writing and a creative story. Every time I thought I had figures out ""whodunnit"" another wrinkle was thrown into the story and I was onto another trail. I'd love it if female writers wrote strong female characters whose entire existence didn't revolve around men but, despite that, this is a good read. It's like the non-feminist Gone Girl. You will read this book in 2 days. Hope it gets turned into a movie so I have faces to hate. "
168,Beth Anne,"won digital galley, can't wait to get started!it is getting increasingly difficult for authors to surprise me with these types of novels. the whole, multiple narrators unraveling the story slowly through their individual story, told alternating chapter by chapter. this book was very good. it is a nail biter of a story. what happened to the missing woman. how is everyone involved. who did it? but not only that. the misery each of these women endured daily was sad. it gave them each a layered quality that kept my interest past the twisted plot and storytelling convention. the characters kept my interest, had back stories that led to their present situations well. great thrilling read"
169,Maurinebachman,"Nice, well written mystery. "
170,Wendy Hall,"I really enjoyed this book! It kept me turning its pages and really had me hooked. So many people say this is a dark book and, although I am not a big fan of murder stories, I didn't feel like it was as dark as much as it was a picture of someone trapped by alcoholism, others dealing with the consequences of infidelity, and the entangled relationships that develop because of both of these difficulties in life. The plot totally drew me in, the character development of these flawed people was great (I identified most with Cathy - the roommate trying not to be an enabler), and I found it hard to put down for a few days!"
171,Tigrish,"WARNING: May contain slight spoilers.Very nicely written, intriguing book. The style is very believable, the amount of detail somehow familiar and the trains of thought very realistic. Oh, but there are some awful people in this book. First and foremost our main character Rachel. She is just so frustratingly weak and pathetic, that I seriously did not feel bad when bad things befell her, I was not on her side. Just thinking about it now makes me roll my eyes at her stupidity. Other people in this book though, are also awful. Some more subtlety so but it's still there, the greed, the lies. Oh god the lies. Seriously, EVERYONE in this book lies. About everything! And for stupid reasons! They are dishonest and unfaithful and suspicious and vindictive and overall terrible people, but for the most part that's hidden behind their every day lives.It kind of makes me sad to think that this is what people like in real life. I know this is what some people are like, but I don't want a lot of people to be like this, not the majority. It's just so depressing. Anyway.The book is certainly gripping. I became so obsessed with finding out what had happened on that Saturday night, and I was so angry at Rachel for being a stupid drunk and not remembering. I really didn't know who to suspect at first, I even suspected Rachel at some point, but it became more obvious towards the end, there were no other characters left. And then you get that inevitable going through the process of it all coming out, I thought to Rachel ""be smart!"" but was she smart? No. The only time she shows some backbone is at the very end of the book. About time.It was certainly a well thought out and exciting read. Not really thriller to me, more like suspense. But still, as I said, gripping. Would recommend."
172,Nadia ,"Without further a do, let's get straight to the point.The main protagonist took an awful lot of time to take a grasp on the reality. I would have given it 5 stars had it not been this frustrating for the major portion of the book. But I got to admit that it was unpredictable. I didn't have any suspicion towards the culprit until the end.I loved that NONE of the characters were goody-too-shoes. Everyone had a darker past and a motive to murder. I loved the creepiness and the darker thoughts. The whole setting had a eerie feeling and I enjoyed that immensely. (view spoiler)[But oh my God Megan! How can anyone be THIS stupid? How did she manage to kill her daughter by falling asleep in the bathtub? I can't even. (hide spoiler)]Overall, a must read if you're into thriller and darker themed books. I haven't read Gone Girl yet (I tried it once and DNFed it after a couple of pages) so I don't know about the similarities. "
173,Dan Radovich,"If you insist on comparing a book to another one, state your reasoning. I have grown so tired of seeing books compared to GONE GIRL - I hope that Gillian Flynn feels the same way. THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN only needs that 'blurb' to get people to actually buy it... and once they begin reading they are in for a treat. Hawkins has created a main character that is riddled with problems and you really should not care about - yet you have to find out what happens. (the ONLY reason to drop GONE GIRL into any commentary/review). This is the perfect book to read on a Sunday when you have nothing else to do. Once you start reading, you just find yourself engrossed and cannot put the book down until finished. Under the right director, this book will make a great movie if cast properly.I saw the Hitchcock film playing in my mind as I read. This is a very impressive debut; I hope that she can continue the good work."
174,Gianna,"This was a fun, creepy read. I really enjoyed the unreliable narrator Rachel. Her drinking and destructive actions added to the thrill of the book because it made me feel out of control. Usually I can predict what is going to happen next, but Rachel’s behavior was so bizarre that I never knew what she was going to do, and that led to a feeling of delicious tension. I also didn’t guess the twist ending, and I always enjoy when a story manages to surprise me."
175,Fran,This will be a tough book to follow. Some clever surprises. 
176,Annette Smith,"This is one of the better psychological thrillers I have read. The many twists and turns in the plot kept me guessing, and only at the very end did I figure out who the guilty party was. "
177,Lee Anne,"First of all, it was so good I read the whole thing in three days, and that happens about NEVER anymore. Second, I didn't figure it out until 60 pages from the end, and only then because Hawkins let me figure it out. This thriller deserves the hype; read it!"
178,Dana Byerwalter,"Oh this was a good read. I was skeptical going in because I didn't love the writing at first, and there is so much hype about the book that I naturally went in with my guard up. About 120 pages in, though, I started listening to the audiobook, and the experience improved so much, and the story was so good. All of the characters were so interesting. I was particularly drawn to Megan. I felt like I was able to sympathize with almost every character, even though they were all very flawed people. That's a win in my book."
179,Bridget,"I wanted to read this the minute I saw it. I couldn't find a paper copy anywhere so bought the ebook. It is a nice deception. You know there is more going on than the author is letting you know, but figuring out the villian(s) is a challenge. It had me hooked from start to finish, but there is a but, it isn't perfectly written, it has some clunky bits, but these are easily forgiven because the story is different, it moves along really fast and the characters are all sufficiently flawed to make you squirm. Blimmin good read."
180,Tanya Winslow,"Great suspenseful murder mystery . Anna the "" girl on the train"" an alcoholic , who is determined to solve who killed Megan. Even though she didn't know her . But as the story unfolds , she realizes they had common thread .. Great read ! "
181,Creative,Its a holiday book. I enjoyed reading it.
182,Danielle Bauter,"This is not the type of book that I would normally read but I'm so glad that I did. A psychological thriller that has already drawn comparisons to Gone Girl, I was immediately intrigued by the storyline. Simply put, a woman named Rachel rides the train every day and creates stories about the lives of the people whose homes she passes. One couple in particular that she fixates on (who she has named Jess and Jason) seem to have the perfect life. Until one day she notices that Jess appears to be having an affair. And the next day it is revealed that the woman has gone missing. It is not enough for Rachel to be an outside observer, she inserts herself into their lives and this has dramatic results. The book is told from three perspectives, but Rachel (the main narrator) is completely unreliable and I found that this added even more to the suspense. This is a compulsive read and although I figured out the ""whodunit"" with about 100 pages left I still needed to know how it would end. "
183,Leonor Lopes,"Foi o meu primeiro triller e confesso k não é bem o meu género, mas , reconheço que a autora narra de uma forma q nos impede o abandono da leitura. No decorrer da história, simplesmente leva-nos a intuir k o culpado pode ser qualquer um dos personagens e fico espantada qd efetivamente descubro o culpado!!Um género diferente k gostei de ler para fugir um bocado aos meus habituais romances ..."
184,Portia,"A nice, quick read. I wouldn't call this book a nail-biter, but Ms. Hawkins does enough with character revelation to keep the reader interested. I wasn't completely surprised by the revelation of the murderer, but Ms. Hawkins threw in a great twist I did not see coming.Ms. Hawkins writes believably of the loneliness that we all feel and of the truth that we irresistibly create fantasies for ourselves about ourselves and about others, often to the point of putting ourselves in danger as a result. Four stars."
185,Anna Hider,"Yeah, I guessed the ending... and I was still impressed by how good it was. "
186,Sonia,Got this book in the mail today. Finished it in less than 12 hours. Took breaks to take care of my kids & then sat down and finished it all. I had no idea what was going to happen..... It blew me away. I loved it. Highly recommend!!
187,Sumithra Krishnan,"The four stars is purely because I never saw the end coming. But that could just be me, many of those who read the book might guess it much earlier than me. So depending upon whether you fit into the slightly-slow-guessing category or the criminally-smart-guessing category you might enjoy or get bored with the book. The similarities between this storyline and Gone Girl is just too much at certain points. With obviously and intentionally strewn plot points I kept on suspecting all the main characters in turn. Not everyone's life is as dreamy as you imagine it to be. Sometimes the truth that is staring at your face is not the real truth. Sometimes you just can't ignore your past. A Girl goes missing, a Girl on the train has something to say and another Girl who could have been just a passerby drags herself back into the story. Go guess who is who!!"
188,Just Deborah,"I liked it, At least I think I liked it.I read a good book today. My problem is that it felt like I was reading it through a mentally ill, alcoholic fog. *SPOILER* This is the first book I read where every single person was mentally ill, a drunk, a psychotic, or an unethical enabler. It is very difficult to read a book written in part by the ramblings of a drunk., the next voice was the scattered thinking of a bi-polar burn out and the the third voice was of a passive-aggressive adulterer. I really mean it, not even the psychiatrist was totally sane. If you can wade through all that, you will probably like this book. But the author gives away the ending on page 245 with one line and 90 more pages to slog through. Oh well we can't all be 5 star writers with every book. This was a good book, not a re-read book. It's not a best o f 2015 book. It's just a stand on its own good book. (I would say it was just an ok book but people reading my book critiques are getting snarky with me) Apparently they take exception to book reviews they don't agree with. And all this time I thought they wanted my opinion, silly me. I did mention it was a good book right?"
189,Desere,"This was a really interesting read. It dips in to the lives of various characters , with really fantastic insight. The main focus is on Rachel, she takes the exact same commuter train every single morning. It rattles down the tracks, past piles of old clothes, dirt and various houses. But from all the houses it passes the one that get's Rachael's undivided attention every single day is the one where "" Jess and Jason "" lives. The couple intrigue Rachael, they fascinate her like no other. Then one morning as the train passes the house, Rachael sees something, it's only for a split second and the train is pass, but it's enough to make Rachael go to the police, but has this caused more harm than good?Fast paced and a nice even flow are the first things I have to say about this read, it moved from point a to b at a really good pace, none of that stop start that is found in so many similar reads, that my dear reading friends drive me crazy !I really loved the mystery in this book, but sadly I figured it out too quickly and I felt a little cheated that I was able to get it so fast. Now that we have that out of the way I can tell you all about the most amazing part of this read, the unrealiable narrator , man it drove me crazy at first but then suddenly it all just became clear and it was like some kind of high to try and outsmart the narrator. To sum it up , this is a terrific read for any reader that loves a great mystery, lots of emotional drama and loads of guessing if you don't pay attention. Don't start reading this one if it's late at night , because after the third chapter it really grips the reader!4.5 star review "" Rolling past the image that changes her life"" "
190,Tammy,This was a story full of twists and turns right up to the ending. 
191,Kimmie ,"I definitely see why everyone was raving so much about this book. I was pleasantly surprised with how the book went because I went into it with zero expectations. The setting was fun, as it was in an English neighborhood and I liked the repetitive nature of the trains. What really got me was the plot twist. I think it was well done and I did not see it coming at all, which I enjoyed. My only complaint was the ending. I did not like how it tied things up and wished that it wasn't as rushed as it was. Lesson Learned:Don't be an alcoholic. Not because its unhealthy, but because it makes you forget things. Noted. :)"
192,Leslynn,"This is what happens when you're bus , as so many women are! The perfect book through which to view base human flaws, without dirtying your own hands, and know how much fun it is to be a fly on a wall. Human characters, without pretense (well, you'll know what I mean), who find themselves in real situations and for whom the outcomes have dire consequences. It's really great to feel relieved at the outcome...or can you?"
193,Ângela Costa,"gostei muito deste livro pela sua diferença em relação aos thrillers psicológicos que tenho vindo a ler. É viciante, envolvente...atrevo-me mesmo a chama-lo de ""tresloucado"" :) Recomendo a sua leitura!"
194,Lisa Dreesman,"If you like ""Gone Girl"" this is a book for you. Multiple viewpoints, a murder to be solved, and plot-twists aplenty! "
195,Rebecca,"I think the most fascinating thing about this book is that the narrator (the main one) is an alcoholic who is spiralling down. It doesn't make her likable at all - but it gives you a look into the mind of an addict struggling in her own suffering and trying to get out. Its written more like Gone Girl - more screenplay than literature but a really good story and characters who are really much more messed up than the average person but -I think her point is that you really don't know much about that ""average"" person on the train or in the street. "
196,Laura Noi,"Un ottimo thriller psicologico. Non mi aspettavo davvero questo livello di coinvolgimento, ansia e dubbio che invece mi ha trasmesso La ragazza del treno. La Hawkins è bravissima a creare una protagonista inaffidabile, nella quale il lettore non può credere eppure vorrebbe credere. Ti porta a dubitare di tutti, di qualsiasi persona tranne che del vero colpevole e quando alla fine esce fuori il tutto tiene perfettamente le redini della trama con una spiegazione impeccabile (cosa che a volte in alcuni thriller appare futile e banale). Consigliatissimo!"
197,Campbell Library,"This definitely deserves the comparisons to Gone Girl that it's been receiving. Alcoholic, down-on-her-luck Rachel whiles away her days by people watching on the train and browsing the internet at her local public library. When a woman who she's been watching from afar goes missing, Rachel knows that she has to do something, tell somebody that she's been keeping tabs on her, has seen things that aren't normal. This is a good mystery, one with mystery that slowly unravels. The altering narration works well for this story - giving us just enough to put the whole story together piece by piece. I did find that the pacing lagged in a few places, but the last quarter picks up, starts racing, and sprints through to the end. I liked this - didn't particularly care for the characters, but I've found that with mysteries, especially dark gritty ones, that doesn't matter so much to me. I want the mystery to be engaging and twisty, something slippery that I really need to hold on to to figure out. Definitely a book I would recommend to fans of Gillian Flynn and Tana French. -Andrea"
198,book_luv_r,"Fantastic story telling. This author keeps you guessing right up until the end. I kinda figured out who killed who, but still second guessed myself. I would have given it 5 Stars, but kept having to scroll back and forth with the dates constantly changing. Became easier to read about halfway through. I'm a ""drink my red wine at night"" kind of girl. I can honestly say that after reading this book I don't crave that evening drink. Rachel's repeated drunken stupor will have you not wanting to EVER be that bad. Great book for those of us that enjoy drinking, but don't have to have it. Paula Hawkins did an outstanding job making you feel sorry for Rachel."
199,Christie,"Quite simply, this book rocks. I went in expecting a scary, psychological thriller, and was disappointed on that front. It is less of a 'thriller' and far more a psychological delving into absolutely terrible people's minds. Yes, all of the characters are absolutely TERRIBLE people. You will not like ANY of them, all. The primary story-driving character, Rachel, is a horrid drunk whose insights you get about a missing persons case. However, the story that the characters are getting through is interesting enough that you will want to keep flipping through the pages of the book. It gets a bit tedious around the middle when you become absolutely convinced of who dun it, but KEEP GOING. There is 50% of the book left for a reason.SPOILERS FOLLOW...The author's greatest feat was throwing the reader for a loop by making you distrust and dislike Rachel so much towards the middle of the novel. She was a drunk, she couldn't help herself with anything, she was a liar, she took advantage of people, she was a creep towards her ex husband, she needed to stop meddling... and she was abusive towards her ex to boot! All signs point to her being the absolute worst, and I'm sure that every reader is like me and becomes absolutely convinced that Rachel was the murderer all along. The twist seems to be so easy to spot! ...but you are thrown for a loop.I will say that the end was kind of terribly executed. Tom's switch didn't seem altogether believable, and yet I'm totally okay with it. I'm glad Rachel wasn't the one to do it, and I hope she makes it to a month sober. And damn, I hope she gets out of Cathy's place because I feel the most for poor Cath. And FUCK ANNA. She's the worst."
200,Abeer,4.5 stars!!!I finished it within 24 hours because it was really a fast-paced read! The characters were remarkably annoying which made the book very effective. And I did find out whodunnit even before it was revealed. But I can say that was a tough case because of minimal or unseen clues. Over all it was a fun and twisted story! :)
201,Marisa Goldsborough,"If you enjoyed Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn you'll love this book too. Everyone's talking about this book, don't let them ruin the twist! I Read it in one day, an easy read but enjoyable book which will keep you guessing until the end."
202,Saurabh Sharma,"This was a pretty decent read which captivated and thrilled me for the most part. Despite the formulaic and somewhat predictable final act the book is a fine example of a crisp, quick paced and fluid narrative. The small number of characters and sub plots that connected well with the main plot made 'The Girl on The Train' a breezy and mostly exciting read. My only issue with the book was that it at times relied on convenient twists to move the plot forward. Also the book does seem inspired by some recent thrillers like Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl. All things said and done I enjoyed The Girl on The Train. No doubt it is melodramatic and seems like a movie's screenplay but the story certainly grips and entertains. It is a well written book that serves its purpose. "
203,Natasha,"Received through Goodreads Firstreads. Thank you so much! I loved it!I devoured The Girl On The Train.It was incredible, so addictive - I found myself picking it up every chance I had. The characters, despite their obvious flaws (as ""people"", not the writing of them), are highly lovable and perhaps because of that, very relatable. The plot is full of twists and turns and takes on very unique narrative vantage points. Keeps you guessing to the end.Fantasic, loved it."
204,Ilse,"Bijzonder verhaal. De eerste helft van het boek leek me een oude stoomtrein die in gang moest getrokken worden; de tweede helft daarentegen was een sneltrein die niet meer zou stoppen tot wanneer het eindstation bereikt was.In het begin kon ik niet in het verhaal komen: traag en eerder aan de saaie kant; echter op een bepaald moment raakte ik in de ban van het boek. Doorheen de verhalen van Rachel, Anna en Megan kwam de waarheid beetje bij beetje naar de oppervlakte. Het einde was dan ook een complete verrassing voor mij. Uiteindelijk dus een goed boek, maar je moet wel even doorbijten bij de start. Geef dit boek een knallende beginfase en dan zou het een topper geweest zijn. Jammer want dit kost Paula Hawkins toch een ster. Maar als debuut heeft ze wel haar stempel gedrukt!!"
205,Chloe,The book keeps you in suspense. There's a couple of twists.characters are intriguing. As you read the book you release how psychological messed up all the characters are for different ways. When you think you know who killed the person and why the author makes you think it could be another character. In the end pretty much all of the characters could have done it. 
206,Bella Grewal,"En riktigt otäck bok. Vågade nästan inte läsa den om jag var hemma själv. Sargade människor och deras öden beskrivs levande. Man blir nyfiken på personerna som porträtteras och dras med i handlingen. Att det är tåg med i historien gör boken ännu bättre, så klart. Alkoholmissbruk, arbetslöshet och misshandel är ständigt närvarande i boken. Intressant och levande, om än i läskigaste laget för min smak. "
207,Mellagirl,"l This book was quite interesting and one of a kind. I hadn't read a book mystery/thriller in quite some time. This was refreshing and filled me quite a bit of anticipation to get back to reading whenever I couldn't. I rated it 4 starts instead of 5 because I have never imagined myself coming across a book where literally not one single character was likable. This however did add to the appeal and intrigue of the book. By the end of it I actually felt more sympathetic and somewhat liked some of the characters which was surprising. This book and its ending definitely takes you by surprise. It really shows that you can't judge a book by its cover. It was a great read that I recommend to anyone who enjoys reading a good novel, especially its out of the ordinary from your typical reading tastes. "
208,Rhonda,"I was not sure about this book at first. I found the main character (Rachel) frustrating and irritating. At times, I wasn't even sure I wanted to finish it. However, I stuck with it and I'm really glad.As unlikable as Rachel is, I did feel compassion for her at times, so kudos to the author for that. I did have a suspicion of the killer at the beginning, but I think I was in that ""suspecting everybody"" stage of reading. (view spoiler)[I think I started figuring out everything at the time the author wanted it to happen. I was not shocked at finding out that Tom was the killer, but I was surprised that he had manipulated Rachel so much and was such a sociopath. I did not see that coming, and I usually do see twists, so that added to my enjoyment of the book. (hide spoiler)]If you like psychological thrillers, you will probably like this one. It's probably not the very best example of one, but it's definitely worth a read."
209,Emily May,Enjoyed it but felt it was a bit predictable
210,Shelly,"I must admit, I have not read Gone Girl and I haven't seen the movie, so I wasn't looking for a comparison going in. I really liked this book, though parts were hard to deal with, it made me re-examine/re-visit personal situations that weren't very pleasant. I did like that the characters seemed real and sometimes even very unlikeable. Very well written."
211,Angela,"I was afraid when I started reading ""TGOTT"" that it was going to be predictable b/c of the comparisons to ""Gone Girl"" (liked, but didn't want same book w/ different characters). So I didn't have real big hopes of liking it. It starts out kind of slow, but I wasn't bored to tears so I kept going wondering where this was going to lead. (Where as reading ""GG"", I almost stopped reading 50 pages into it because I was bored. Glad I didn't.) When I got to around page 55, I noticed the dates of the entries were jumping back & forth over a six month period which I found confusing & annoying. However, when I started paying closer attention, I realized that Hawkins was probably doing this deliberately to keep the train of thought slightly muddled so that it may be harder to determine the outcome. I actually appreciate the technique now that I have finished the book.The characters were realistic even though for the most part they were all unlikable (some more than others) but I think they were meant to be. Meaning, I probably wouldn't want any of them as a close friend. It could be repetitive & drag at times, but not enough to slow the reading or made me want to put it down.I really like ""TGOTT"". I would definably recommend this book. As a matter of fact, I will have to go back & reread (at least certain entries again soon) soon so that I can see where I went wrong. When I got to the revelation & had to stop & think ""Wow"" she got me. I would love to elaborate, but I don't want to give away any spoilers. Once you read it though, you'll know what I'm talking about. I was pleasantly surprised with the book as a whole. Don't give up on it!"
212,Jill Jackson,"I could not put this book down, and that is high praise indeed. After I was finished with it (in an all-night marathon reading), I began to think ""Was the plot plausible? Were the characters realistic? Could any of the events truly happen in real life?"" I began to doubt my self. Perhaps the conductor of this train was taking me for a ride like a deceitful lover. And I enjoyed every minute of it."
213,Phuong,Rounding up to 4 stars for the lovely British accents. Last night I made the mistake of reading some Goodreads reviews and came across one without a spoiler alert. Thanks a lot for telling me whodunit!! :/
214,Amanda Pearl,4.5 stars. really great thriller. full review to come
215,Holly,"I liked this one better than Gone Girl, but I still had the same problem with this one as I did with Gone Girl. I didn't like any of the characters! This one has some good twists and turns, though, and the train is a clever device. I didn't see the ending coming, and it was a good one. It's definitely compelling - I finished it quickly, and I won't be surprised if it's turned into a movie some day."
216,Katie Bliss,"Riveting! Taut! I really enjoyed this, the mystery, the perspectives, the twists. Highly recommend, could barely put it down! And in the time between when I put it down and could pick it up again, I mulled it over. Great example of how reality may be different from perception, and of how our lusts can be not just our downfall, but others' as well."
217,Shelli,"I haven't read a book like this in a long time. One where I wasn't really attached to any of the characters, but I literally could not put it down. I couldn't wait to get back to it and see what happened next. It had me guessing for 3/4's of the way, and after that I was still interested right up to the end! Good reading!"
218,Joanie,"This book sucked me in from the very beginning. As much as I found the mystery interesting, I was much more taken by Rachel and her sad, lonely existence. Every morning Rachel wakes up with a feeling of dread and tries to piece together what she did while drunk the night before. Her shame and self-loathing are palpable and they put a knot in my stomach. The actual mystery was sort of secondary to me I guess. I quickly suspected how things were going to turn out so that part wasn't quite as exciting but I was totally taken in by the characters, as unlikable as they were."
219,Lauriann,"This suspenseful thriller could also be entitled ""The Shadow People,"" because there was always someone lurking in the shadows and I never quite knew who was the lurker and who was the lurkee (I just made up that word). Rachel views her old neighborhood daily from the seat of the London commuter train. As she passes by, she grieves for her her former life and home now occupied by her ex, his second wife and their baby. She also dreams up scenarios about a couple in a house not far from her ex's. A mysterious disappearance sets things in motion. Twists and turns kept me guessing about the potential for good or evil in the main characters. This story gained momentum towards a powerful ending."
220,Lade Tawak,"I loved this book. I really really enjoyed it.it was a bit slow in the beginning, but it got better.It's a well woven and very interesting story about three women and how they're interconnected.You don't see the end coming until you're almost at the end.A great read and I'd recommend to anyone who likes mystery and suspense. [Apparently, this is Paula Hawkins first book of this genre. Very hard to believe as it's very awesome]"
221,Michele Whitecotton,"I thought this book was great. It was intriguing from the very beginning, it caught your attention and never let go. I liked how it was told from different POV's and you never had an inkling of who took Megan. I liked Rachel as a character, she had real everyday problems and just got sucked into everything by harmlessly watching people from a train window. The reason I took one star away is because I got tired of reading about how fat and ugly Rachel was, it had no bearing on the story at all. It was interesting reading Anna's parts of the story to see Tom through her eyes but for her to constantly remind us of how much better she was than Rachel because Rachel was fat got a little old."
222,Saeed,"I'm not the first person to say this, and I certainly won't be the last: The Girl On the Train is this year's Gone Girl. A domestic noir, it has a similar premise: a story told from various perspectives -- but instead of one unreliable narrator, it foists multiple ones on us. Regardless of how you feel about the denoeument -- it's a little too deliberate and ingeniously constructed -- you won't be able to put this book down. It's gripping, it's cinematic, it's a page-turner that had me ignoring chores and ate up the better part of my Sunday. The premise: A girl on a train passes by the same house during her daily commute and, possessed of a vivid imagination, she dreams up a life for the couple who live there. That girl is Rachel. She's a self-pitying wreck -- unemployed, perpetually drunk and hung up over her ex-husband. She's prone to blackouts and drunk dialing. She's needy and irrational. And she's the main narrator.To her, the couple who live in the house possess the perfect relationship she once had -- or *thinks* she once had. The others who keep the story moving along are Megan, the woman who lives in the house -- complicated, manic, and with an outsized secret that's eating away at her; and Anna, who's now married to Rachel's ex -- passive, oblivious and desperate to build a drama-free life for her and her family.When Megan goes missing, the lives of the three women intersect in strange and arresting ways. Saying any more would spoil the many surprises Hawkins has packed into the book.Don't go into The Girl on the Train expecting great writing. No one ever should when it comes to thrillers. But Hawkins, a journalist by training, has pacing down pat. She does a beautiful job of withholding key pieces of information, drip-feeding them to us at just the right moments. She switches narrators right when tensions climax. And like the train, she keeps the story barrelling along. "
223,Jasmine,"I read this book months ago and totally forgot to do a review. Shame on me. But the book was so good to the point where months can go by and I still remember exactly how the book made me feel and why I liked it so much.Surprisingly enough, this might be my favorite book of the year. And not necessarily because the book lived up to the hype, but because of the way the book made me feel while reading it. I realize that the book’s “evil twin” is Gone Girl. But, I didn’t think of Gone Girl at all while reading this. The book stood alone in my mind, which I recommend trying while reading!Now, I’m not a huge fan of multiple POV’s type reads. The plot can get messy and parts of the book can become cloudy. It’s easy to hate characters when their POV comes up then goes away. But with this book….I didn’t feel that way. Actually, I was reluctant to even start the book because it was such a popular book and I hate hype (loathe is probably a more appropriate word). Nothing EVER lives up to its hype….ever! So I was about to just return it to the library and convince myself it’s the book, not me.Additionally, I read the reviews on Goodreads reviews prior to reading (not always the best idea either) and a lot of people were saying that the book is incredibly slow and has an unremarkable ending that falls completely flat. I have to disagree completely! I was hanging on each character’s every word and phrase. I was so intrigued with each character and how their voice contributed to the overarching story. The story was surprisingly dense. The characters were unlikable, yes. But the way the author constructed the character’s interactions was seamless. I was absolutely sucked into their sick, obscure and whiny lives. The book practically read like a movie. I vividly imagined everything each character experienced, scene by scene. The author successfully set the scene and tone through the voice of each character. Quite frankly, I would have enjoyed a male POV (and you would understand why after reading the entire novel). That would have opened a completely different perspective and changed the flow of dialogue.The ending was great in my opinion. I never saw it coming. Once everything played out and everyone’s POV timeline lined up, I binged to the end. This is probably one I wouldn’t mind reading again in book form rather than ebook. And that’s saying a lot because I am not a re-reader. It would probably benefit me to re-read it because I read it so quickly due to its “thriller” qualities and I’m sure I missed some things. I would definitely read much slower the second time around and really absorb what is happening around each character.I kinda hate that I even remotely liked this book….because everyone liked this book. But I have to give credit where credit is due. This book is a good one."
224,Dannelle,"I found ""The Girl on the Train"" to be a very enjoyable read. This book had me constantly putting together different scenarios in my head of where the author was going and every time I was wrong. The suspense was just enough to keep me enthralled but not too over the top. Paula Hawkins creates an assortment of characters that are equally complex as they are unlikeable. I found the most difficult part of the book for me was that I didn't really like the characters and found myself not really caring what happened to them in the long run. I would definitely recommend this to others to read. It is fun, fast, interesting and entertaining. Not quite as good as Gone Girl but in the ball park."
225,Kelly Roudebush,"Keeps you guessing, well written, but it's NOT the next Gone Girl"
226,Amanda Davis,"I read this for a book club. I wasn't sure if I would like it because the last two whodunit books I didn't like and figured out things before the end. This book was good. It wasn't amazing and most of the characters annoyed me, but it was very intriguing and I didn't really figure it out until it was brought to light. I suspected everyone at one point lol because I just figure if I do I will get it right eventually, but I didn't really truly believe that the person behind it was the one it was going to be. It was a quick read and I enjoyed it."
227,Dick Reynolds,"	We meet Rachel in chapter one and she’s a bit of a mess; drinks too much and full of self-pity. It seems the best part of her day is on the train to work in London and back home again. The train usually makes a short stop so she can see the house she once lived in with ex-husband Tom. She misses him terribly and wants to get back with him but he’s remarried and having none of it. During the train’s pauses, she takes time to notice the couple who live just four houses away from her former home. She calls them Jason and Jess and is jealous of the life and love she imagines they have together.	In chapter two we meet Megan, the woman who lives in a house next to the railway and is the person Rachel imagines to be Jess. She’s married to Scott (aka Jason) who seems more interested in his business than his wife. Megan would like to have a lengthy vacation on some tropical paradise but that’s not in the cards. Megan has a part-time job as a nanny, taking care of Anna and Tom’s baby, of the family living four homes away. Yep, Tom is THAT Tom, Rachel’s former husband. 	Each chapter is marked with the name of the woman character who is narrating her story and a date. In Rachel’s case the date is ‘current time’ but for Megan, it’s several months earlier. I wasn’t confused by this technique for it serves to tell Megan’s back story while Rachel tells her daily sad tale.	So now the stage is set for something sinister to happen. And you know that somehow, some way, Rachel is going to inject herself into the lives of these people who live next to the railroad tracks. When she sees a strange man fondling Megan, Rachel believes she has justification to get involved.	The story builds steadily and leads to a dramatic ending with all the loose ends neatly tied. The only negative in the book for me was the five major characters. Each one had significant defects, they were often irritating to read about, and it was hard to feel much sympathy for them."
228,✿Sandra,"Great book especially for a debut. Lots of twists and turns. I did figure it out before the end, but it was still well put together and had me guessing for a long time. "
229,Lynn,"I heard a lot about this book, and requested it quite awhile ago. I got it this week and it only took me a few days to read it. Definitely a page turner!I heard this book compared to Gone Girl, but honestly, I liked this book more. I thought the main three female characters were more complex than any of the characters in Gone Girl. I thought the writing was very good, and I liked how the central mysteries of the story revolved around missing memories in the main character, Rachel's, mind.Overall, a satisfying thriller. "
230,Taylor Findlay,"Going into this book, I will admit I had very low expectations. It just seemed that it was one of those books that was harping on the popularity of Crime Fiction due to GONE GIRL by Gillian Flynn. However, I found myself devouring three quarters of this fantastic mystery/crime in less then three hours.I was engrossed into the characters and they destructive personalities, the ways in which they chose to deal with their own lives and relive awful pasts. I couldn't take my eyes off the the 'who-dun-it? ' mystery. even better, until the last twenty pages I literally had no idea who had done it. The writing was intensely personal, to the point where I felt as though I was reading the diary of people that really existed in a tragic even I've previously seen on the news.Overall, and surprisingly to myself, I utterly loved this book. Makes me want to more Crime Fiction!"
231,adam (booksss.0k),"4/5this was slow moving, ya'll. it was a good slow burn. when it did get fast, it got very fast paced. when it got overhyped, it got very overhyped. people say this is the next gone girl, but my body is still waiting on that thriller novel that can satisfy me the way that Gillian Flynn did. I don't think this is fair being compared to gone girl, but I really recommend it. the story takes a little effort to get into, but when you do, then you will really enjoy it. "
232,Lucy,"Take a rainy afternoon and read this thriller. I enjoyed the writing style and the way the stray is told by three different characters. Some are worse than others, but all are flawed. Add to your must-read list. "
233,Trina (Between Chapters),"WHOA.First of all, if anyone compares this book to Gone Girl in their pitch to you, DO NOT LISTEN. Sure, it's similar in the fact that it's an adult mystery/thriller in which a woman goes missing, but if you read it looking for another Amy Dunne, you'll miss the story actually unfolding.Parts of this story dragged for me. At times it felt very wash, rinse, repeat. Our main character rides the train, gets drunk, passes out, wakes up the next day and discovers approximately 348 phone calls from the various A-holes in her life, and then she drinks some more, gets back on the train... on and on. Drink, pass out, repeat. I had mixed feelings about the truth of the mystery. It wasn't obvious from page one, and I did enjoy watching the characters put it together. But I didn't enjoy the way the book pointed you right at the answer a little bit before it was actually revealed. I felt like we knew for several chapters what had happened, but it kept being drawn out as the characters figured it out. I wished there had been one last twist, or at least that it had wrapped up a little quicker after it became obvious.Overall, this was a gripping mystery that keeps you in the dark long enough to let you come up with your own theories, which made it very enjoyable. My top theory was incorrect, so I liked being surprised. I also really enjoyed how some of the scenes were very sneaky, and how a lot of the answers were there from the start. Even though the reveal came about more slowly than I wanted, it still amped me up, and ultimately left me satisfied."

235,Ruthanne Davis,"Well...for the first hslf of the book, I was a confusion! i kept rereading parts of chapters trying to keep the chsracters and the plot straight. Normally, I would not have had this amount of patience but something kept nsgging at me and telling me not to give up...and I had not even read any of the Goodreads reviews! I'm glad I stuck with it..but was more like a rollrr cosster ride than a train ride'No spoilers here but it's suspensful with less than honorable characters that you find yourself thinking quite dispicable but rooting (for some of them) despite yourself!"
236,Andie,"I listened to “The Girl on the Train,” by Paula Hawkins as I have been repeatedly told to give it a try. Set in the London suburban outskirts, and propelled through the story by way of a commuter train, this psychological thriller jumps forwards and backwards, interspersing points-of view. Three women tell one story – a whodunit. Rachel is the broken woman on the train who is forced to roll by her old life every day. She's an alcoholic and still obsessing on her ex-husband.Anna is the young wife and mother who stole herself a husband, and now misses her days as a mistress. Megan is the seemingly perfect wife on the balcony with the carefree appearance and the handsome husband, but she hides secrets and yearns to run away. It was a fresh story (quite a feat in the age of ""Gone Girl"") with remarkable pacing and tension, but also an amazing audiobook with fantastic narrators.I highly recommend the story, and will add - listen to it if you can.As far as debut authors go, Paula Hawkins is one to watch."
237,Amber Daugherty,"This was the first book I've read in awhile that made me really excited about reading. I mean the kind of excited where I went home from work, made dinner and then just read until I fell asleep (late, because I wanted to stay up reading). This book was fantastic - Hawkins does an incredible job of creating suspense, of building the characters, of keeping you guessing. I went back and forth between my thoughts on Rachel (the main character) but that just made it more interesting to read - I genuinely wanted to know what had happened and I found myself actually getting angry at her for not remembering. That love/hate relationship with her was what I found pushed the story forward.Read this book if:-You enjoyed Gone Girl-You're a sucker for a good suspense/thriller-You're looking for an intense, enjoyable book to devour in one setting"
238,Susan Buchanan,"I was recommended this book by a friend and am glad I read it. I would class it as Gillian Flynn meets Emily Barr. The unusual main character being an alcoholic who experiences black holes in her memory works well and brings everything into question. What's real and what's up for debate? I kind of guessed about 70% through the novel who the villain was, but it didn't detract from my enjoyment of this excellent thriller. There were a few pretty good red herrings along the way and some very disturbing characters who would easily have fitted the bill. The protagonist, Rachel's self-loathing and her history as a woman scorned and her stalker-like tendencies, as well as her finding solace in alcohol all make for a gripping read. That, combined with an ex who is understanding, an ex's new wife who is overwrought and demanding, as well as protective of her child ensure the reader gets pulled into the tangled web which is Rachel's life. The daily train journey which she makes and the fantasies Rachel builds in her head on viewing occupants of the houses she sees on that journey are the basis for the story. Those fantasies and the realities of course differ dramatically. Rachel involves herself directly with the occupants of some of those houses with life-changing results. Would definitely recommend and will happily read the next book by this author."
239,Sofia,"I really liked this thriller book, it gets more intense as you keep reading and has a good plot and story, in spite of the fact that I already ""knew"" who was the guilty one even before reaching the middle of the book but that maybe it's just because of my unsettling and instinctive mind that always look for clues on places/people that people often tend to forget about."
240,Margitte,"A thriller it is! Three young women, Rachel, Megan and Anne, deal with their pasts and their relationships in three different ways. Each one of them has a story to tell when detectives must try to solve the case of a missing member of this group.Rachel commutes on the train twice a day to London and passes the homes of Anne and Megan, witnessing their happiness, she was denied. Her alcoholism prevents her from thinking rationally. It results in her being declared an unreliable witness to the police. Apart from obsessively looking out the window of the train onto the other two women's houses, she was also once an inhabitant of the same street, before her life was turned upside down and her marriage went up in an adultery haze. Rachel has flashbacks of events which confuses her, and the police are not in a hurry to believe anything she says when she tries to explain what she witnessed and experienced.I am not caught up in the hype around the Gone Girl-craze, since I have not read the book yet, and won't do so soon - by choice. I'm judging this book, The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins, on its own merit and it is passing with flying colors as a (psychological) thriller. An excellent one. And a very-well written debut novel to boot. The ending was a bit drawn out for my taste, but it doesn't cause the story to be less dramatic or enthralling. I have read similar books that was even better, but they somehow have all slit through the grid of attention. I identified the culprit since the first appearance of his name in the book, and that's not a good sign. I actually prefer to be proven wrong. :-) Although I must add that the unexpected denouement caught me totally off guard and had me catching my breath in surprise.If you are in the mood for a really good thriller, or a whodunit, this will be a superb choice. A riveting tale of dysfunction covered by a pretentious roof of happiness. What an enjoyable read! "
241,kristen,"I am a ""lightweight"". I get freaked out easily and psycho-thrillers usually disturb me to the point of losing sleep. The Girl on the Train was a good match for me. I thought Hawkins wrote a great debut novel. I liked the varying viewpoints and the gloomy mood. I couldn't put it down, waking up and telling my family over breakfast that I had to find out who the killer was in my book. I wasn't disturbed, just impressed with a psychologically thrilling tale that kept me on the edge of my seat until the end. This was a 5 star read for me up until the end which seemed to labor on in such a way that made me a bit impatient. Overall, a really great read."
242,Sarah,"I had this book on my tablet for months without touching it despite all the praise and recommendations. I wanted to read it but just never got to it so I finally decided to make it my first book of 2016. The Girl on the Train is definitely similar to Gone Girl in several ways. One is how quick of a read it is and how easily engrossed I became with it. Another is the obvious: the twists the story takes and the reveals that happen throughout. Then there's the fact that in both books, I didn't particular like any of the characters while still enjoying the book. Hawkins did a really good job with this story and she kept me guessing, not all the way to the end (I don't remember the exact moment I figured it out, but it was before the reveal in the narrative) but long enough. I found myself looking for clues so I could figure out everything on my own. While I did figure out the major plot point, there were details revealed that still surprised me, and I was glad for that. I don't like predictability in mysteries and I appreciated that this wasn't like that at all.One other thing to note is that I liked that each of our three narratives were not only all unreliable for various reasons but also that they were each distinct in voice. That's something I look for when I'm reading a book that has multiple points of view, and I think that Hawkins did really well with that.Overall, I'm glad I read this and I enjoyed it and was glad for the suspenseful, twisting ride the book took me on."
243,Anny,"Muy buen libro. Engancha desde la primera página, y es muy recomendable. "
244,Skylah,"The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins is a fictional story and wasn't what I had expected it to be. Three different narrator stories merge into one large conflict. The main narrator, Rachel, is an alcoholic and an unconventional hero. The second narrator introduced, Anna, has a seemingly good at home life; the final narrator Megan it made out to seem like she has the desired life. Soon everything that is portrayed by these characters is shown to be untrue. The story is well written and all loose ends are brought together in the end as wanted in a book. However, some things the main character, Rachel, does may make you aggravated. She at times makes such stupid decisions you may want to yell at her. Other than this there isn't much bad about the book. There are surprises and plot twists and there is a mystery factor that makes you want to continue reading. In my opinion the book is worth a read, and someone who enjoys a mystery or a character with a lot of challenges would enjoy this book."
245,Beverly,Loved it. It was an easy fast read because I wanted to know what happened and who did it. 
246,Loraine Despres,"This book is a compelling, can't-put-down read. Paula Hawkins deserves all the success this book brought."
247,Anne,"I didn't intend to read this book in the first place. There was a customer at my work that left it after finishing and responded very positively on it. And it also happened so that I had to take a long train ride just the following morning, so, perfect condition. The narration is thrilling, I was struggling to put the book aside. I finished it just while being on the train - there and back. If you have the same problem as me - I can't continue reading a book if the beginning is not exciting - then this is a total saviour. I love reading, but lately couldn't find a proper book. And this was it, out of nowhere, so unexpected.The story is super depressing indeed. I could project some of its parts to my life and even found answers to my own problems, so to me it was even inspiring in a way. In a certain way. I was quiet shocked about the ending, so I may not be a Sherlock, but I don't think that the outcome is that obvious.A really nice book, gave me back the taste to reading."
248,Jen Bevan,"It started a little slowly, with a pitiful and depressing character. It jumps from the perspective of one character to another's and jumps a bit in time. Once I figured that out, I was hooked. It was a great, thrilling read."
249,Anna,"I went into this thinking it would be more of a mystery novel, with a focus on finding clues and solving a puzzle, but it's definitely a thriller. It's fast-paced and filled with twists that make it a hard book to put down. I liked the use of three different narrators in theory, but I don't think it was very effective--Rachel and Megan's voices were too similar, and Anna's sections made her more of a stereotype than a character. Still, this was an engrossing read with an interesting premise."
250,Jennifer S. Brown,"Honestly, I don't even know if I liked this book or not, but I could NOT put it down! I turned pages so fast. I seem to be alone in my love of unlikable characters, but these folks were all terrible, and I couldn't get enough of it. At a few points, the story did seem to sag, but I was so eager to know what happened that I quickly plowed on. I found this a very satisfying read and I'm glad I finally got around to it."
251,Josh Mann,"Solidly good thriller. I enjoyed piecing this together with the character...even if it at times was as difficult for the reader to separate fact from illusion as it was for Rachel. Well written, tightly structured....just a good fun read"
252,Rachel Hall,"I liked it. Did not at all think it was like GONE GIRL -- I guess there's GIRL in the title? [shrug] Maybe the comparison comes from unlikeable characters? [shrug again] But! I did like it. The not-knowing and trusting that comes with relationships, the alcoholism (although that went on a little longer than I'd like). But Paula did an incredible job. I'd recommend it!"
253,Lainen24,"No sabía qué esperarme de este libro después de todas las opiniones que había leído, pero la verdad es que me ha gustado más de lo que esperaba. Al principio la lectura se me ha hecho un tanto pesada, pero ha sido pasar la mitad y no poder parar de leer.Reseña completa en mi blog: http://los-mundos-de-caroline.blogspo..."
254,Carol Brill,"Rachael is The Girl on the Train. She is an alcoholic, grieving about being childless, obsessing over and harassing her former husband Tom and his new wife Annie with late night, drunken phone calls. She fantasizes about a couple whose house she passes every day on the train. In her fantasy they are perfectly happy Jess and Jason. In real life they are Megan and Scott. One day, she sees something that suggest they are not as happily married as she imagines. The next day, Megan goes missing and the suspense ramps up. The story was slow for me until that point. Some have compared the twisted infidelity and suspicious spouse to Gone Girl. I saw those similarities. I found the characters in The Girl on the Train much more sympathetic...not exactly likable but not despicable either. It took me awhile to figure out who did it. The author used a device of referring to a character as just him/he, implying it was one character when it might be another. I found that very well done and it added to the suspense. "
255,Yolanda Gorman,"Creepy and fast paced! Certain parts were reminiscent of ""Rear Window"", which gave it the Hitchcock feel. I couldn't put the book down! I can't wait to see the movie adaptation."
256,Marilú Cuentalibros,Me ha pillado en una época lectora en que me costaba mucho concentrarme y pese a ello no he abandonado este libro. Destacaría sobre todo a su protagonista y pese a que hay elementos que no son novedad es una lectura que te mantiene leyendo la mar de ocupada. 
257,Keri-Lee Beasley,"Woah! Intense! This book totally plays with your mind. Clever twists and turns makes it a real page-tunerI struggled to connect with the main character, which meant although I wanted to keep reading, I didn't enjoy the book as much as I'd hoped. I felt similarly about We Need To Talk About Kevin. Great book, challenging characters. Definitely worth a read. "
258,Bajen,"OMG what a book! I refuse to give it five stars. I did not like the characters, except maybe Abdic a little, but it was a good story. The story is about Rachel who is divorced, a drunk, unemployed and just out of it really. Everyday she takes the same train to and fro the city and during these journeys she always watches out for a couple who live along the way. She fantasizes about them and I think she sees in them what she wish she had. One day something horrible happens, it coincides with something Rachel saw at the couple's place, add to that her almost constant drunken state and everything goes haywire. The story is told from three POV, Rachel's, Anne's and Meagan's. And all three ladies are sick really. I could not relate to any of them and honestly would not like to know any of them. The story flowed well and it kept me interested all the way to the end. The author is good. I feel it would be unfair to give lower than four stars. But I did not like it enough for five either lol. "
259,Rosangela,"It's a very sad story, the right word is ""depressing"".Although I'm not a fan of this kind of story, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, it's well-written and kept me involved.And no, I didn't read ""Gone Girl"" so I can't say if they are similar.It reminds me a little bit the book by Elizabeth Haynes ""Into the Darkest Corner""."
260,Marjorie,This was a book club book. I couldn't put it down! Wow.Don't read anything about it just read the book.
261,Joel Nunez,Not at all a GONE GIRL copy. Just a good old whodunit. A page-turner. Can't wait for the movie. 
262,Diane Yannick,"I do not think this book is a great piece of literature. I don't think it has enough discussion points to work for a book club. There was nothing to highlight and read again. BUT it was wonderful escapist reading and sometimes that's just what I need. There was a compelling narrative which kept me going back for more. It's not a book that I was willing to let lie untouched for more than a few hours-- a luxury of the retired. Every book that even resembles a psychological thriller has to be compared to Gone Girl so let me say that for me they were about equal. There was a little more suspense in GG but the ending was better on the train. The two main female narrators are quite unreliable, especially Rachel who drinks an incredible amount of alcohol. Anna's shallowness verged on the absurd. Yet, somehow she redeemed herself a little at the end. Tom, the main man, was interesting only as a plot tool (pun intended) to let us gain insights into the girls. I never liked his attitude but can't say much as I don't want to spoil anyone's plot. It's worth reading as long as your expectations are properly set. I gave it a 4 for its genre. It certainly isn't a 4 compared to a piece of literary fiction that someone like Peter Heller would write. "
263,Mariiine,"J'avais hâte de lire le ce roman qui a suscité tant d'engouement et je ne suis pas déçue. C'est bien écrit, très oppressant et assez addictif quand même. La fin ne m'a pas tellement surprise, mais tout au long du livre, je me suis possée des questions, j'ai revu mes théories...C'est un peu étrange d'avoir pour personnage principal une alcoolique très dépressive, mais on voit l'intéret assez rapidement. Bref, j'ai aimé :D "
264,Deepa,Well this was the first book of 2016 for me .After going by the reviews shared by readers I decided to start my year with this book and I must say I am not disappointed.Paula Hawkins certainly knows how to engage readers and build suspense.What I like most about this one is the style of narration .The way most of the story is covered while traveling on the train by the main protagonist it was easy for me to relate with the characters as I used to take metro for work as well.The only thing which could have been better was the ending ..I thought it was a bit overstretched.having said that I do feel that this is a great suspense thriller and a must read .
265,Nicole Del sesto,"Being touted as this years ""Gone Girl"" and as much as I liked Gone Girl, I think readers will be more even more engaged with this book. Good writing (for a debut thriller, great writing), interesting scenarios. Engrossing. I was really impressed overall. I found the main character easy to relate too, not so much in how she reacted to her circumstances, but how she felt about what she'd been through. I finished it last night and haven't stopped thinking about it today. Definitely worth reading. "
266,Joyce (JumbleofJargon),HOLY CRAP!!! Totaly worth the monotonous middle bits.Disclaimer: people keep comparing this to Gone Girl. Obviously this is not as good as Gone Girl. Why is that even a question?! 
267,crimethrillerhound.co.uk,"Since the one with the tattoo we've had lots of girls pop up in titles but, like Salander, they're not actually girls. Books used to be called 'The Woman In White' so why are they now jumping on the 'girl' bandwagon or should that be train? Gone Girl, Girl Friday, Hard Girls, etc have a patronising, exploitative angle that doesn't sit well with me. Rant over, this book is a suspenseful story in the style of Strangers on a Train, The Lady Vanishes or some other Hitchcockian yarn. It certainly grips, compelling the reader to keep the pages turning.Unreliable narrator Rachel is the unusual central character. Different in that she's relatively unattractive, a little overweight, depressed, unemployed and an alcoholic. perhaps more real than many a lead then. The other two women, Megan and Anna, have their own problems, the cause and results of which merge with Rachel's as the stories come together. Rachel still bothers her ex which in turn bothers his new partner. Bordering on a stalker she had unlikable qualities and yet I liked her. Her vulnerability and neurosis make her intriguing, and her behaviour entertaining, just so long as you don't have to live with her. It's a good ploy to have her make up the lives of the couple she watches from the train. Then, when Megan goes missing, she has info for the police; info that they (and the reader) doubt to be true. Clever. The book's perspectives and timescales constantly shift and the novel's strength is in its telling. Domestic noir and poisonous relationships are filling the shelves at the moment. Not sure I like the trend but this is a good example of the subgenre. Hawkins manipulates the reader with skill in a novel populated by dark secrets and selfish characters. I knocked a star off for the convenient 'returning memory' after blackout. Oh and the title."
268,Victoria Harris,"I actually enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I was going to! The characters are all pretty messed up. The three females that tell the story all have problems, and the males are certainly not out-done on that front. I can't make my mind up as to whether the characters are cliché are not, but I don't think it matters. It delivered a very fast read with heart-pounding moments and a great ending (even though I worked it out). Overall I'd say to read this book if you're in the mood for a psychological thriller with a slightly different format. (The book is split into little Morning and Evening sections.) "
269,Marcy Wells,"This was a very enjoyable read! I saw it advertised with the slogan ""if you liked Gone Girl you'll love this."" And I fully agree. It was somewhat better than gone girl actually. A good thriller that reads fairly quickly. I would recommend."
270,Anne Frisbie,"I loved how this story was told through narrators with such (weak) self-biased perspectives that it was difficult to tell what was real. I also loved how the different points of views were shared along a timeline that went forwards and backwards almost at random - yet this random timeline seemed quite perfect and very natural. Very well done psychological thriller, and not surprising that the book is currently #1 on the bestseller list.Hard to give this book five stars, though, since all the characters were very flawed - on many levels. The characters were so annoying that they really could drive you to drink. "
271,Tyler,"It's nothing like Gone Girl, at all. This is a British thriller/mystery type deal. The main female character is a well-conceived character that isn't perfect-that's about as close a reason I can find to a GG comparison. She's a fairly delusional drunk but much more sympathetic/relatable than Flynn's protags. Her POV is consistent and maddening to most sane people. I've seen other reviews that criticize her behavior like characters in a book should conform to some boring standards. If the character is a borderline stalker, then you shouldn't complain when she acts like a stalker. If you guess who it is, then good for you. There's about 8 characters in the book so you would've had a pretty decent shot without even reading the book. The whole idea of figuring it out who did it really isn't that obvious and it's not really the point of the book. I don't try to find out who did it as any reader should know the author can contrive any situation to make it any character so there's no point-it didn't really happen folks. Entertaining read once it gets going. "
272,Chris Andress,"I liked it, it kept my interest.The ending was a bit like all the suspense movie endings."
273,Marta_austen,"Se avete visto ""Gone Girl"" avrete notato che la storia è molto simile. Comunque devo dire che il libro mi è piaciuto molto, i personaggi sono ben caratterizzati (anche se la protagonista è ovviamente quella con più spessore).La storia scorre bene è intrigante e dato che la letteratura contemporanea è quella che è forse è il miglior libro di questa estate 2015."
274,LIVE.LOVE.READ,"Rachel pendelt täglich mit dem Zug nach London. Auf Grund einer Signalstörung hält der Zug jeden Morgen an der gleichen Stelle an und gewährt Rachel einen Blick in fremde Häuser. Rachel beobachtet die darin lebenden Menschen, gibt ihnen Namen und baut in ihrer Vorstellung ein perfektes Bild von ihnen auf. Doch eines Tages geschieht etwas, was nicht in Rachels Bild passt. Als kurz darauf auch noch eine Bewohnerin der Häuser verschwindet, wendet Rachel sich an die Polizei und wird immer tiefer in die Geschichte hineingezogen.Die Geschichte wird aus der Ich-Perspektive von Rachel, Anna und Megan erzählt.Rachel, welche die Hauptfigur ist, ist eine Alkoholikerin und lebt fernab der Realität in ihrer eigenen Blase. Ich habe Rachel immer wieder als abstoßend empfunden. Gleichzeitig hat sie mir sehr Leid getan. Im Laufe der Geschichte erzählt die Autorin warum Rachel angefangen hat zu trinken, man erfährt welcher Leidensdruck hinter einer Alkoholsucht steckt und sieht zu welchen Problemen sie führen kann. Anna hat mich sehr genervt und ich habe sie als extrem überheblich empfunden. Ich verstehe zwar viele ihrer Sorgen und Probleme, dennoch habe ich ihr nicht getraut, dafür hat sie sich für mich zu sehr hinter einer Maske aus ""Ich bin ja so eine tolle Mutter und Ehefrau"" versteckt. Auch mit Megan bin ich nicht wirklich warm geworden. Sie war mir einfach zu flatterhaft und unbeständig.Wirklich sympathisch ist mir also keine der drei Figuren gewesen. Figuren, die mir nicht sympathisch sind oder mich gar so abstoßen, wie Rachel es stellenweise tut, führen oft dazu, dass ich ein Buch abbreche. Bei dieser Geschichte hat mich das jedoch nicht gestört, denn die Figuren sind für diese Geschichte genau richtig so wie sie sind.Die Geschichte hat mich gepackt, ich wollte immer wissen was passiert ist, was aus der Vermissten geworden ist und ob sie nicht vielleicht doch wieder auftaucht. Darüber habe ich auch nachgedacht, wenn ich nicht gelesen habe. Ein bisschen ist das Buch so, wie wenn man von einem solchen Vermisstenfall in der Zeitung liest und in den Tagen danach noch häufiger an die verschwundene Person denkt.Im Laufe der Zeit entsteht ein immer komplexeres Gesamtbild. Dadurch, dass man erst einmal wenig weiß, baut sich schnell Spannung auf. In der Mitte zieht sich die Geschichte etwas und ich habe immer darauf gewartet, dass etwas passiert. Auf den letzten 150 Seiten nimmt die Spannung dann aber wieder zu. Ich konnte keiner der Figuren trauen, hatte zwar immer wieder einmal eine Vermutung, was denn geschehen ist, richtig aufgeklärt hat sich aber alles erst gegen Ende. Auch werden gegen Ende einige noch offene Fragen beantwortet, so dass sich das Ende rund und richtig anfühlt.Insgesamt hat mich ""Girl on the train"" von Paula Hawkins wirklich sehr gut unterhalten. Die Figuren fand ich interessant, denn jede der drei Ich-Erzählerinnen bricht auf ihre ganz eigene Art mit den gesellschaftlichen Normen in der Hoffnung, ihr Glück zu finden. In der Mitte war die Story ein klein wenig langatmig, davon abgesehen fand ich sie aber spannend. Und auch mit dem Ende bin ich zufrieden."
275,Janet Richards,"Suspenseful, but reminds me of a lifetime or made for TV movie. Female character development strong, but male characters were far less developed. Created an imbalance in the story, especially at the end. "
276,Wendy Darling,"4.5 stars Everyone in this book is absolutely terrible, and as a result, this book is a masterpiece in character study and development. It's also a well-written, precisely plotted psychological thriller, and deftly sketches one unreliable narrator after another. I guessed the culprit not too far into the book, but that didn't spoil my reading experience at all, particularly because the author drops so many diverting and convincing red herrings into the story. I think it's also interesting that the central character, Rachel, challenges readers to think about how much we assume about--and pre-judge--other people based on our limited knowledge of them. To feel pity, disgust, frustration, compassion, and so much more for one character is a rare thing. Recommended to fans of Before I Go To Sleep, and for YA readers, fans of Dangerous Girls and Nova Ren Suma. "
277,Andy Bird,"This is not bad. It is quite well written and very readable. The story is good, albeit a bit forced at times. The style works well, switching between the different women involved, usually as a look back at what has just happened. It does jump about in time a bit but this does just about work ok. I did find the main character a bit stupid and found it hard too empathise with her. In fact there was nothing about any of the characters which was likeable, I didn't mind what happened to any of them. It's not quite as good as some of the books it is compared to i.e. Gone Girl, but it's quality of writing does raise it above many. I would recommend it."
278,Jackson,"Had me hooked from the beginning and kept me on the edge till the very end! When all the pieces of the puzzle started fitting into place, I found myself shocked... I really wasn't expecting that twist!"
279,Anood H,"The Girl on The Train was a suspenseful page-turner. Okay, I gotta admit that it was kind of hard to get into but by the time the actual crime took place I was super hooked. All I wanted to do was read and find out more and more. I'm not really a fan of thrillers and/or crime books but I did enjoy the writing style of this book. I didn't think the plot was so complex or intense but the characters, how complex their stories and their personalities are, especially Megan, kept me interested in finding out the real criminal. The ending was a satisfying one. It was fitting and I think it did justice for all of the characters although I'd liked to read more about Scott and Abdic. Still a great read. "
280,Shirley Schwartz,"There has been much hype about this book, so I was glad when my e-book came in so that I could read it. I was not disappointed with the book and, in fact, I enjoyed it more than Gone Girl and The Paying Guests, which are the two most recent books I've read of this genre. I think the three female viewpoints help to keep the book interesting and it certainly helps to maintain the tension. All three women are strong characters, and the three main male characters are realistic and strong too. Rachel is the main character, and when we meet her, she is a train wreck. She's lost her husband and her job, and she drowns her sorrows in alcohol. All the time I was reading about her blackout drunks, I felt that there was a lot more behind the drinking than even she admits to herself. Megan is another woman who has lost her job. Even though she has a husband who loves her, she is profoundly unhappy. Her sorrow is as a result of a past event that happened to her years ago, and it causes her to make many bad choices that will eventually come to a catastrophic conclusion. Anna appears to be the most normal one, but even she has personal crises that cause her distress and her ""perfect"" life is really not what it appears. The males that are involved with these women, both past and present, have their own demons that will have a profound impact on these women and on their lives. The thing that ties up all the loose threads in the story and all the lives of these characters is the commuter train that runs by their houses at many different times of the day. The train is the one constant thing that never changes and it's what brings all these people into proximity. As the tension builds, masks are removed and the three women finally begin to see things clearly. For some it is too late. For others a long overdue redemption finally comes to them. Nothing really is as it seems in this little community. The book is a very good psychological thriller and I enjoyed it."
281,Debbie,"Great book with lots of twists and turns to keep you guessing right until the end. A murder mystery/ suspense thriller.Felt it was a little hurried at the end and enjoyed the tension and build up better.Centres on the lives of three women Rachel, Anna and Megan. Although Rachel, the girl on the train, is the main character the story moves along hearing from each woman.Interesting to have Rachel as a drunk, added another dimension as you didn't know whether her account was reliable."
282,Antonio Barron,"La verdad... Lo logró, no pude dejar de leer a pesar que no lo pude leer seguido pero me gustó mucho, el principio es un poco lento y raramente redactado y el final creo también le faltó algo peeeeero para ser su primera novela creo que lo logró bastante bien y a pesar de que mi primera sospecha resultó ser el mero mero, sí me hizo dudar de mi suposición casi todo el libro!!! La verdad sí me gustó y mucho :D"
283,Aulia Mia,"Buku ini rasa misterinya kuat banget, jauh lebih gelap dari Gone Girl ataupun Dark Place. Ada permainan emosi yang membuat kita merasakan ketidaktenangan para tokohnya, kemarahan, rasa sakit, kesedihan, ketakutan, bahkan kegilaan. Rachel si pecandu minuman keras, jelas kesulitan membedakan antara realitas dan khayalan. Ketidakstabilan emosinya membuatnya melakukan hal-hal buruk yg bahkan tidak dapat diyakini oleh dirinya sendiri. Aku merasa sedikit kasihan padanya karena semua orang melimpahkan kesalahan kepadanya dengan alasan dia pemabuk dan tidak stabil. Megan yang cantik, cacat secara emosi. Karakter seperti Megan sering kita jumpai dibanyak buku. Cantik, cerdas, periang dan menarik tapi memiliki sisi gelap dalam dirinya, masa lalu yang membuatnya tidak pernah benar-benar menjadi dirinya sendiri. Dia bisa menjadi siapapun, tapi tidak bisa menjadi dirinya sendiri. Seorang artis, seorang pembohong. Sedangkan Anna, ada yg salah dengannya. Rasanya susah untuk percaya bahwa dia wanita, istri dan ibu yg benar-benar baik - susah untuk menyukainya, ada kemunafikkan dalam dirinya. Sama seperti Megan, dia seorang artis yang hebat, seorang pembohong dan penipu. Pada akhirnya, setiap orang harus berdamai dengan dirinya sendiri, dengan masalahnya, dengan masa lalunya, dengan hidupnya. "
284,John,"The movie will be interesting!!!!!Skillful writing.....Rachael's unreliably provides enough questions so as to keep this reader uncertain as to what's real, what's imagined..... "
285,Amanda Cinelli keith,"4.5 stars. So suspenseful, I had to keep reading these past 2 days to see how things end. I'm sure it will be a movie real soon!"
286,Kiwi,"Ever wondered what goes on in the houses you come across on your daily commute? Do you invent stories for the people who live in them? Reality is often far different from the one created by our imagination. Paula Hawkins has written a page turner, despite the ending that, for me, was a bit overdone and predictable, I enjoyed very much reading this book. A great début novel, will be looking forward to her next book."
287,ElphabaNewlin,"(originally reviewed at 
elphareads.tumblr.com
)I was super late to the GONE GIRL party. I don’t know what happened, but it took me forever to get on that. When I got to the party (let’s continue the metaphor), I was like 'woo, yes! Here I am let's party!'. But then when I left I was like 'that was awful I should have stayed home'. I really didn’t like that book, ‘It Book’ status and everything. So recently, it became pretty clear that THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN by Paula Hawkins was going to be the next It Book at my library. In that there were already 200+ requests on it after it got my attention. I put myself on the list, figuring I’d have a long wait. Serendipity intervened, and I got my hands on a copy. Rachel rides the train every day. It’s really the only thing that gives her solace. Her marriage fell apart, she has a drinking problem, she lost her job, her life is a mess. On top of all that, her ex, whom she is still hung up on, married his mistress and had a baby with her (Rachel’s infertility was one of the driving factors of her drinking problem, and knowing he had a baby with his mistress just twists the knife). Every day she rides the train, living her life vicariously through two strangers she sees in their home by the tracks. She calls them Jason and Jess, and they seem sublimely happy. She cherishes the peeks into their relationship she gets each day on her ride, and feels like she knows them. But one day she sees something that breaks her illusion of their happiness. And shortly thereafter, Jess (or Megan, as her real name is) goes missing. Rachel wants to help figure out what happened to her, but is seen as an unreliable witness, even though she thinks she saw something that could break the case wide open. As Rachel starts her own personal investigation, she starts to uncover truths about not only Megan, but about herself as well. And all of these truths could be quite dangerous.Well I liked it better than GONE GIRL, so it has that going for it. Though at times it was very hard to read because Rachel is SUCH a mess, I found THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN very hard to put down. Told in multiple perspectives (Rachel’s, Megan’s, and Anna’s, the mistress of Rachel’s ex), this book is one big jumble of unreliable narrators. But what I liked about it was that while you thought you were solving one mystery, there were other things to be solved, things that it took me awhile to see coming. I can’t say anymore because that would ruin the fun. I found Rachel to be absolutely pathetic and hard to read about, but as I got to know her more my initial vague disgust turned into some serious pity. The girl is messed up. Really, none of the voices were easy to read. Rachel is an unstable mess, Megan is a vain flibbertigibbet, and Anna is a flat out bitch. Yeah, I said it. But they were all very real in their own ways and they were all very interesting in their own ways as well. I kind of had a feeling I knew where it was going, but it still had a fair number of revelations that I found surprising. It definitely kept me guessing in a lot of ways. I actually stayed up far too late last night just so I could finish it, so it has that going for it. And unlike GONE GIRL, while the characters were all messes in their own right, at least I could find people to root for, and had an understanding of why they were such messes. I think that if this book keeps up it’s momentum we will see a movie based on it. Whether that movie will give us a glimpse of Ben Affleck butt remains to be seen, but THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN was a tense read that hooked me in."
288,Pavlina Needham,Very gripping right to the end. Would make a good film adaptation .
289,dalnim,"Quello che mi è piaciuto di questo libro è quello che tanti potrebbero benissimo odiare: I personaggi sono TUTTI imperfetti, la protagonista principale è essenzialmente un'inetta ma nonostante tutto riesci comunque ad immedesimarti in lei. I personaggi sono estremamente reali e per la maggior parte anche squallidi. Soprattutto Anna che non ho potuto vedere dall'inizio alla fine. Non è un romanzo positivo, anzi. A me ha appassionato molto anche il mistero, che si risolve tutto nelle ultime pagine, ma mi hanno appassionato anche i rapporti fra i personaggi, il loro evolversi e il generale senso di catastrofe che aleggia in tutta la storia."
290,MaryKate,"What a great read! It went so quickly for me and once I started it I didn't want to stop.Rachel rides the train every day and sees the same couple in their backyard; eventually, she creates names and personas for them. But one day, she sees something in that backyard that changes everything. What she sees is not what you think and while the ending wasn't mind-blowing, it kept me wanting to pick up the book to know what happened next. In my book, that's pretty highly rated!"
291,Lianna,"Psychological thrillers in the vein of Gone Girl are becoming mighty popular right now, which may be why some people will pick up Girl on the Train. The similarities are there for sure - flawed characters who you can't help but love to hate, a twisty plot that keeps you guessing and an ending that leaves you feeling just slightly uncomfortable. And this formula? It works. I was hooked on this book almost from the very first page and overwhelmed with a need to know just what happened (unlike Gone Girl though, I figured this one out pretty soon). Girl on the Train is highly entertaining and definitely worth picking up if this genre is your thing. "
292,Rayna,A nice quick read. l kept thinking l knew who it was but was surprised at the end. Not what l was expecting when l picked up the book.
293,Rise," People compare the book with Gone Girl as it deals with the ""sinister sides"" of women. Well, to some extent, it does remind me of Gone Girl, but for me, it's still two different things. The book is an easy read, I could finish it in just a day. The story starts when Rachel Watson is on the train, commutes from her home to London. Between the places, the train will stop for a while, and she will observe the live of others in the track side house. Everyday she'll see her favorite couple whom she named as ""Jason and Jess"" and she'll construct and deconstruct their lives in her head. She thinks they're perfect until something happened to ""Jess.""The book has three PoVs, all of them are women. Each PoV is from the first person, so when it comes to Rachel's PoV, things are quite blurry, as she is an alcoholic and has problems on remembering things. Compared to my hating towards Amy from Gone Girl, I find myself not hating Rachel. Rachel is perhaps unlikeable as she is alcoholic and unable to keep her life straight. But, I think I have same position with Rachel's flatmate, Cathy. I am unable to hate her, I feel sorry for her instead. For the plot itself, it's smooth and engaging. The clues are here and there and can be easily picked up. As for me, I was able to suspect the villain from the second half of the book, but I still didn't see the real ""monster"" coming in the end. It kinda surprised me how the final chapters going and somehow I like how it finally ends for Rachel. Last verdict: 4 stars. "
294,Heather Webb,"Gloomy, immersive, and addictive. "
295,Hurricanekerrie,"This appealed very much to the Investigation-Discovery fan in me! It is creepy and interesting in a downcast, cry-in-the-shower, duck-under-the-covers kind of way. The depression and alcoholism fairly jumps off the pages. This story sucks you in with a vise grip as you, the reader, loftily think you have the moral high-ground on these women, only, by the middle pages, you're not too sure. Our main protagonist, Rachel, is a hot mess but I couldn't help rooting for her to get sober and get her act together and be less unreliable. Perhaps, it's the shared interest in looking out train windows and imagining the lives of the people who live in the houses that pass by. Perhaps, it's because we're all just a wobbly inch away from being hot messes ourselves. I have heard this book compared to Gone Girl a lot-- which was obvious given the crazy female protagonists. But this book has not one but three of them! And though I will give Gone Girl the stealth and the artistry in the reveal, The Girl on the Train has the advantage of being captivating right away and sustaining that mood through out. Plus, it ties itself up in a neat little bow at the end; sometimes, the reader deserves a full, unmitigated, absolute conclusion."
296,Selena Kitt,"Interesting mystery, unreliable narrator, which makes things confusing at times. Worth reading through to the end. It didn't blow me away but it was consistently good. "
297,C,"Definitely a page turner!Rachel, an alcoholic, is struggling to come to terms with how her life currently is and reconciling that with how her life was. She then involves herself into the murder investigation of a woman who she has seen daily from the window of her train commute to and from London. As usual, things imagined are never how they turn out to be, which Rachel painfully discovers.I felt manipulated while reading this book yet, it's a good representation of reality; first impressions mean a lot, but things are not always what they seem."
298,Rachel Morgan,Amazing and gripping till the very end...very original story line! edge of the seat type stuff!!
299,Lindsey,"I really liked this book, couldn't put it down. I liked the hot mess cast of characters--there's no ""good guy"" in this book. But then the ending really let me down. With so many despicable characters in the book I was expecting something more sinister. Seems to me the author choose the easy way out in an effort to validate her main character. Definitely knocked it down a star for me."
300,Nancy Bujnicki,"I enjoyed this book. It took me a while to get into it. I couldn't really relate to the characters at first,but by a third in I couldn't put it down. Love trying to figure out whodunnit!!"
301,Sebastian Glints,"04 - A book published this yearWell, here's a book that I never thought I'd end up enjoying but actually did. Since I had to pick a book that was published this year (2015), and had no idea whatsoever of what was out there, I decided to grab my Kindle and check the reviews for all releases within the year. This one was at the top and I know what you're thinking: how can you pick a book based solely on its reviews? Well, I didn't... mostly. I downloaded a sample chapter and investigated what the book was about before actually making the purchase. I liked that it was a mystery, and that the main character was a girl, which contrasted with Fight Club, my previous read, which is a story that features mostly guys. Little did I know there were a few surprises.The story itself was kind of slow at first, though not un-interesting. It took time for me to get used to it and how it developed. It was surprising to find out it was not written from one girl's point of view, but three actually! And all in first person. This allowed me as a reader to get to know the characters and their feelings much better. You get to know what they think and experience, which can be both satisfying and unnerving when getting to know them. But it was great to see how Rachel, the main character, untied the knot and finally resolved her biggest concern, thus proving that being a drunk was not the biggest of her problems. And you can actually relate to all characters, as they are very real and very human, filled with flaws and insecurities.I would have liked for some more diversity in the characters. It's a book that is very girly, in a way, but without being overly... “pink“ I guess could be the word. These are full-on, violent bitches when they have to be, but there isn't a lot of male presence within the characters. So, again, I was surprised. I wasn't expecting to like the book, it was very modern, but Brits still got it! I'm happy I followed my instincts! I'd totally recommend it if you're not looking for anything too serious to read and just want to entertain yourself to a good mystery."
302,Patti,"Did not predict the ending! Would've been better to read in book instead of Kindle, so I could follow dates as they jumped around."
303,Mary-Beth,"I keep hearing this book called ""this year's Gone Girl."" The two novels share a missing woman (is she dead?), a sociopath, an unreliable narrator, and a swift-cutting plot device with chapters narrated by different characters. Both are page-turners! Can't wait to read ""Gone Girl of late 2015 or 2016"" next, once a novel is so anointed."
304,Veronica,"Di chi ti puoi veramente fidare?Ho ""divorato"" questo libro.Mi è piaciuta molto la tecnica di narrazione: 3 donne, 3 punti di vista differenti.Nulla è come sembra, ce lo insegna ""La ragazza del treno"".Rachel è una ragazza come tante, insoddisfatta della sua vita, che si perde in quella di altri ogni volta che prende QUEL treno. Il suo interesse e la sua curiosità sono rivolti, in particolar modo, a Jess e Jason (la coppia perfetta a cui Rach guarda con un pizzico di ""invidia"").La verità è che nessuno di noi può realmente sapere com'è la vita di chi lo circonda.Cosa si cela dietro il sorriso della nostra vicina di casa? Il matrimonio idilliaco dei nostri amici è così meraviglioso come appare?Tutti nascondono dei segreti. Alcuni segreti sono peggiori di altri e possono davvero cambiare la vita di una persona.Rachel lo sperimenterà sulla propria pelle, probabilmente pentendosi di non essere rimasta una semplice spettatrice, nascosta dietro il finestrino di un treno."
305,Mia Nauca,"4.5Super adictivo, con personajes muy interesantes ya que todos eran problemáticos. Para la gente que disfruta un buen thriller THIS IS THE BOOK "
306,Laura,"I actually think this book is worth the hype - it's an incredibly strong debut. It's kind of obvious why it's compared to 'Gone Girl' so much, but it's a much better book. In 'Gone Girl' you also have an unreliable narrator, and a missing person. The big difference for me was that in GG I could barely tolerate the main characters at the start and wound up hating them - by the end I felt they deserved each other. In this book, Rachel starts out as pretty unsympathetic and by the end of the book I was totally in her corner. Meagan and Anna also began as (and could have remained) stereotypes. The way the author changes your perspective on pretty much every character is incredible.Not all of the twists in this thriller are that surprising. But the end was strong and it was a fast, really compelling read.The story is told from the perspective of different characters at different points in time. Since the voices can be similar, it was a little hard to tell them apart at times - you had to remember when the speaker was talking. But that was really the only problem I had with this book."
307,Amina,"A crazy psychological thriller, thank you Hitessh for the recommendation :)It's crazy how your life can get tied to people you don't even know..Rachel: mid-thirty woman, alcoholic, has a messy life, after being unable to have a child, she goes through a painful divorce, can't move on with her life and can't get herself together, her only escape is alcohol and those moments she imagines the life of ""Jess and Jason"", a couple she picures perfect, who lives on the same street she used to and where her ex and his new wife are living now, and whom she observes from her train every day, a murder happens, she was too drunk to remember, she thinks she's done something bad, some scraps of memory get back to her but she can't tell if it's her brain or what's really happened..Anna: the new wife, the one who's known all about it and who didn't bother to clarify, mother of a child ""Evy"", thinks she's better than Rachel and that she's having a perfect little life until the truth strikes her and she realises that she's nothing like Rachel, she's much worse if I allow myself to compare both of them..Megan (Jess): a broken soul I guess, sometimes a mindless young woman, the secret she's keeping deprives her life from sens, married to Scott (Jason), a jealous man who tries to please her, once a galery owner, she doesn't know what to do with herself when she no longer works, so she starts a series of affairs, one of them's gonna lead her to her end..These are the three main characters the story revolves around, three women, totally different but tied together by some kind of destiny.."
308,Karen,"Rachel, the girl on the train, has a life that has fallen apart and is headed nowhere fast, along with a serious drinking problem. She becomes involved in the disappearance of Anna when she witnesses a scene from the train that she thinks is crucial to the investigation. The Girl on the Train read like a Lifetime movie, a good one, but still, a Lifetime movie. Plot:3 stars, Character development and writing: 4 stars. Sorry we never got a chance to talk about it, Paul...I will remember this book, not so much because it was memorable, but because of you."

""I have lost control over everything, even the places in my head"".-Rachel
Lo que vamos a hacer es que les voy a hacer una lista de 4 cosas que me gustaron y 4 que no sobre este libro.Primero lo que NO ME GUSTÓ:1) Es algo predecible.2) Los personajes masculinos me parecieron algo ""Meh"" cuando los comparabas con lo profundo que podrían llegar a ser los femeninos.3) Fue no tan emocionante como creído sería. Y es un libro chulo, pero no es para tanto.4) Rachel, el personaje principal, más que simpatía lo que me daba era una pena y a veces hasta risa, al menos hasta casi el final. Lo que pasa es que estaba loquita.Ahora lo que SÍ ME GUSTÓ:1) Es predecible, pero al menos es entretenido. Sabía el final hace un ratico, pero aun así lo disfruté.2) Las mujeres son preciosas en este libro. Son personajes tan ""rotos"" que los sientes súper reales. Me cayeron bien ellas. 3) Me gustó la narración. Eso de que se contaba todo desde las perspectiva de 3 mujeres que, al principio no parecen tener tanto en común y luego te das cuenta de que sí, y lo de las fechas y mañana y tarde, aunque no es que sea lo más original del mundo, estuvo chévere.4) Gracias a ese libro aprendí que cuando me enamore de alguien tendré cuidado. A veces hacemos muchos disparates cuando queremos a alguien e ignoramos la verdad estando delante de nosotros, pero no negaré esta gente se pasaban."
310,Cyndi,"Twisted, fast paced and totally believable. My take away is that this is a worthy read with some thrills and chills thrown in for good measure."
311,Brina,"""Girl on the Train"" gehört zu den Büchern, die in diesem Sommer besonders gehypt werden. Kaum eine Buchhandlung, die nicht einen riesengroßen Buchstapel davon bereits am Eingang stehen hat, sodass man an diesem Buch nur schwer vorbeigehen kann. Da ich eigentlich bei solchen Hype-Büchern sehr skeptisch bin, hatte ich dementsprechend nur geringe Erwartungen an diese Geschichte, allerdings konnte mich die Autorin sehr überraschen, denn dieses Buch hat den Hype durchaus verdient.Ich muss zwar gestehen, dass ich am Anfang etwas Probleme mit der Geschichte hatte, weil auf den ersten Seiten nicht wirklich passiert und man lediglich erfährt, dass Rachel jeden Tag pendelt und dabei die Häuser beobachtet und sich zu den einzelnen Menschen Geschichten ausdenkt. Dies kann natürlich interessant sein, allerdings hätte die Autorin hier einiges etwas interessanter gestalten können. Danach wurde die Geschichte aber zusehends besser. Die Handlung nimmt an Fahrt auf, wird immer spannender und am Ende habe ich mit Rachel mitgefiebert und wollte unbedingt mehr über alles erfahren, sodass ich das Buch nur noch schwer aus den Händen nehmen konnte. Rachel ist zwar an sich nicht unbedingt die größte Sympathieträgerin aller Zeiten, weil sie sich selbst ständig belügt und sich gewisse Dinge nicht eingestehen möchte, allerdings fand ich ihre Geschichte dennoch sehr interessant. Auch die anderen Figuren, wie z.B. Megan sind interessant und gut ausgearbeitet. Da die Geschichte auch aus der Sicht von Megan erzählt wird, bekommt man einen sehr guten und authentischen Einblick in ihr Leben und die Gewissheit, dass nicht alles immer so ist, wie es scheint. Während Rachel sich immer wieder das Leben anderer Menschen vorstellt und diese für das von ihr erfundene Leben beneidet, bemerkt sie nicht, was sie damit sich und anderen anrichtet und somit ist es kein Wunder, dass sie sich viel zu sehr für Megan interessiert, die für sie in der Kurzbeschreibung jedoch nur Jess ist, da sie sich deren Leben immer wieder ausgemalt hat. Außerdem kommt hier noch Anna zu Wort, die ich trotz ihrer interessanten Geschichte leider absolut nicht sympathisch fand, denn diese ist jetzt mit Rachels Ex-Partner zusammen, den sie ihr ausgespannt hat. Es war von daher manchmal schwierig, ihrer Geschichte mit diesem Wissen im Hinterkopf zu folgen.Dabei wird hierbei oft die Geschichte aus der Gegenwart, aber auch aus der Vergangenheit erzählt, sodass man als Leser viele Momente hautnah erleben darf, die von der Autorin sehr detailliert und lebhaft beschrieben werden. Dabei ist auch klar, wie schlecht es den drei jungen Frau oftmals geht, bzw. ergangen ist. So sehr ich stellenweise auch mit ihnen mitgelitten habe, blieb jedoch immer eine gewisse Distanz, was ich jedoch vollkommen in Ordnung finde, da dies bei einem Thriller dieser Art manchmal ganz gut so ist.Das Ende hat mir unglaublich gut gefallen. Die Auflösung war nur minimal vorhersehbar und ich habe mich dabei erwischt, wie ich beim Schließen des Buches anerkennend genickt hat, was bei einem Thriller bei mir nicht häufig vorkommt. Die Autorin beantwortet hierbei noch sehr viele offene Fragen und nach und nach ergibt alles ein Ganzes, mit dem ich sehr gut leben kann.Das Cover ist schlicht, gefällt mir aber für einen Thriller sehr gut, besonders die Farbverläufe sind gut gewählt. Die Kurzbeschreibung ist ebenfalls gelungen und hat mich direkt angesprochen, sodass ich diesem Bestseller unbedingt eine Chance geben wollte. Insgesamt konnte mich ""Girl On The Train"" aufgrund seiner gut ausgearbeiteten Figuren, einem interessanten Plot und vielen spannenden Momenten begeistern, sodass ich das Buch nur sehr schwer aus den Händen legen konnte. Ich kann es demnach nur empfehlen und freue mich auf weitere Bücher von der talentierten Autorin."
312,Dawn,"I really enjoyed this book. It was a well written story, and I do in particular, really love when books are written in the first person, and also when there are then more than one person so you get a broad perspective. I like the way the chapters flow from one person to the next.... Beyond that, the story itself was well told. I like how the details that one person observed were then later seen in a later chapter in a different persons version of the story... For example, Rachel witnesses something from the train.... then later on, Megan describes that same situation and mentions the passing train. Very clever and well thought out.I did think it ran a little slow in the middle. At one point, I was tempted to just google what happens, lol.... But I didn't, and I stuck with it, and I am glad that I did. The story does unfold and then pulls itself back together in a solid fashion.It did leave me thinking though... I thought the very end might have been better, but it was still good... And it did have me questioning thing about life, which hey, is why we read, right? But issues like love, friendship, how well we really know anybody, what is real and what is not... these themes are all in this book, and if you like books that make you think about it afterwards, you will be happy with this one..."
313,Cassie,"The story line of this book was a solid one, but it was slow to start for me. I had a tough time figuring out what was really going on with the main character, and then when I did figure it out, she stressed me out! After the story started to develop I really loved how the characters seemed to be so intertwined, and their personalities seemed to mirror each other. Their struggles were real and the emotions were portrayed very well. The part of this book that I liked the most was that it kept me guessing until about the last 20 pages and I loved that I didn't know what was going on right away. One more note: I often saw this book compared to Gone Girl, and I loved Gone Girl. And I can see some similar themes like crazy, train-wreck women and a murder mystery, but I wouldn't compare the two. With that said, I did really enjoy this book. "
314,Chris Auer,was definitely a good book. confusion at 1st with the seperate time lines. but as you got further into the book everything tied in great. i am glad that Holly recommended this read. i definitely wasnt disappointed.
315,Sammi C,"haunting, heart breaking, fascinating."
316,Joanne Liddy-mctavish,"I gave it a 4 not cuz it is a great novel, but it was a fun thriller with a damaged anti-heroine, and kept you reading."
317,karen,"I once read a book by a former alcoholic where she described giving oral sex to two different men, men she'd just met in a restaurant on a busy London high street. I read it and I thought, I'm not that bad. This is where the bar is set.oh, yeah - this one is going to be a must-read for those people looking to find their next Gone Girl experience. it's an incredibly fast-paced and engrossing psychological thriller, and i was on board as soon as i read the editor's bit of ARC-copy, even though i know that writing those things is part of the job and not at all unbiased. but it's hard not to be swayed when you read:Within days of my introducing the manuscript in March, people from every department were regularly pulling me aside to testify to how much they loved the read, how they couldn't put it down. At a recent meeting, a colleague who was twelve pages from the end was secretly reading them under the table because she could not stop. Another had the manuscript propped up next to her phone so she could read between calls, and last week in the elevator, people around me suddenly started competing over who'd read it fastest, and who was more surprised by the ending. You know you have something special when it becomes watercooler talk for months on end.it would take a very stubbornly cynical person to see that as anything other than genuine enthusiasm. and the book definitely delivers. it is an absolute page-turner with a number of unreliable narrators ranging from the self-deluded to the spotty memory of the blackout drunk. i am too busy reading on my daily commute to notice my fellow passengers unless they are smelly/behaving in an unstable manner (frequently), or exceptionally attractive (MUCH less frequently), but apparently this is a thing that commuters do - notice their fellow travelers, making up stories about their lives, speculating about what they do when they're not in the in-between moments of their day. and rachel does it more than most. rachel is blisteringly lonely, drowning the sorrows of her failed marriage with grim determination and canned gin and tonics and endless bottles of wine. she has lost her job because of her perpetual drunkenness, but rather than tell her flatmate, she keeps taking the train into london every day, pretending to go to work, but actually just getting drunk in various places, and happily fantasizing about the young couple she watches every day from her train window; a couple who live a few doors down from her old house, where her ex-husband tom still resides with his new wife and baby girl. still reeling from tom's infidelity to her, she nonetheless would love to be back with him, and in this golden couple she observes and imagines, calling them ""jess and jason,"" she sees the life she could have had with tom. one day, while commuting/gazing voyeuristically, she witnesses ""jess"" on her front lawn with another man, in what appears to be a romantic clinch. she is outraged at this display, as personally offended as if the infidelity were being committed against herself. shortly after this episode, she learns that ""jess,"" actually named megan, has disappeared, and feeling connected to this couple she has never actually met, she insinuates herself into the investigation, meeting with both the police and megan's husband, actual name scott. the story is told from three perspectives: rachel's, megan's, and tom's new wife anna, and covers all the traditional viewpoints of the typical domestic drama: the jilted lover, the other woman, the cheating wife. all three of these women are simultaneously sympathetic and repellent, which is tricky to pull off. and as for the mystery of megan's disappearance itself, well that path splits and splits again in a wonderful head-spinning journey where not a single character avoids suspicion (except MAYBE tom and anna's infant daughter); i think there are seven characters in total who appear to be the culprit at one point or another, and each seems as plausible as the next. it is a fantastic ride, and hawkins does a great job with both the mystery elements and the character development, with great attention to detail, and fully established backstories and motivations. even when you cringe at some of the choices, they completely make sense for the character. it is a lot of fun, and terribly addictive. much better than a meeting, i kid you not."
318,Dhivya Chandrasekaran,"A psychological thriller that is a wonderful read. It is fascinating, gripping and a little creepy. Think Hitchcock film in a book! "
319,Sam Lovell,"I really find myself liking this novel, mainly because it's like something I would write. As a young (trying to get out there, but simplistically having difficulty actually finishing a novel) author/writer that may seem difficult to imagine but I am very much engrossed in the adult-novel shelf and have been in the process of writing my own. The Girl on the Train is a witty portrayal of the lifestyle of three dishonest narrators. Though of course, The Girl on The Train centre character is Rachel. The girl on the train who observes the couple who she admires, and wants to be basically; 'Jess and Jason.' Now Jess and Jason are seemingly perfect, which is what this woman wants to believe, and then when she see's the dark side of their lives there is no turning back. She is now involved. I love the story, and it is well written for the most part, excusing the fact I did find a few spelling/grammatical errors but they were only minor and that could have just been me who spotted those. I don't mean to come off as someone looking for the 'mistakes' because I am not. I very much liked this novel.  My only problem is that Paula Hawkins, alike A.S.A Harrison both are inspired by 'Gone Girl.'  Yes, I know, I KNOW: every review on a thriller/mystery novel 'has' to be compared to Gone Girl. Though I am getting tired of the 'new Gone Girl's.' Am I alone in this?  Well don't get me wrong because I love both Girl on The Train and Gone Girl but I felt Girl on The Train was very much influenced by Flynn's work. I feel like Hawkins really did well in writing the perspectives of all her narrators and her ability to change tone is very good in her writing though there were a lot of the same kind of themes that are in all of the new thrillers right now. Someone has gone missing. Someone has had an affair. The husband/wife - for the most part the husband - is the one with the finger being pointed at.  A lot of work in new literacy has been heavily influenced by Gone Girl, but what I wonder is if people are writing like 'Gone Girl' due to actual inspiration or to see if they can benefit from the same success Flynn has.  Aside from all this 'new Gone Girl' stuff, I did really like the novel. I could even connect to Rachel which I didn't see myself doing from the first page. There is something I love about her accounts in the story. The girl on the train. The person trying to escape her own life. I understand a lot because we've all been there at one point. Admiring/wishing to be another. I find myself commonly in malls, staring out at the atmosphere and examining others around me; 'sometimes I want to be YOU.' I think when seeing the assumable 'rich' people walk past with many bags from Chanel, or when I see the happy content family all smiles and giggles. There are times when we want to escape the world we live in. Rachel is shown to have these thoughts but on a more so intense level, having been very attached to her idea of Jess and Jason. And when finding out what 'Jess' has been 'doing' she even states that she would 'scratch her eyes out' in the early pages.  The Girl on the Train, while I believe to be, yes, another novel which is written from the inspiration of Gone Girl, is a very clever novel. I would like to see in the thriller department something more out of the norm because I think this book came out at just the right time. It came out at the period where people wanted more of this Gone Girl alike shock, and it came out just before (at least I think) people had had enough.  Hawkins would be on my list for 'thriller authors to watch out for' because this work is truly memorable but I do feel like authors should not write due to what they believe will make them successful but to what they are actually thinking and 'wanting' to write due to the fact they want to write it; for it to be read. Whether Hawkins does abide to this I do not know, but either way she has written a very clever, very interesting piece of fiction and I wish her all the best as an author. Even though this is the first of her 'thriller debuts' I would like to see a more diverse novel next time because as I said before - readers are starting to want more from the thriller norm - and due to what we have seen from Hawkins thus far she could be a great contender to write the next big thing in the thriller sector, hopefully a little more out of the blue and less influenced on other work. Who knows. Would I recommend personally though?Yes.I just have to say yes because it is such a good novel, and the idea and plot is perfect. If you are getting bored of 'seemingly perfect marriage, turns out to not be' than maybe put off the book for a bit and find something else but make sure to come back to it once you have filled your reading palette with something a little more different. I may be wrong in thinking the work is heavily influenced by GG and I may be harsh to say that authors these days are looking to benefit of the same success Flynn has had but personally, if it's me reading the signs; the novels are all being at least slightly based on Flynn's masterpiece. Maybe I am very biased as I just love Gone Girl, and Girl on the Train is more than just a two person account of marriage. It's through a stranger's perspective, it's through 'Jess's' perspective...I mean, the story is very good and has looked to pace up and make a more creepy story than GG but ultimately I did find myself sighing at what comparisons I could make while reading between the two books. Still, that is not me saying that it is not good enough because you just have to read it. It's a chilling portrayal of everyday life, and I can very much connect to the most part of the narrators and I can simultaneously love and hate them. If you like books like that, make sure you pick this one of the shelf because it is worth the read. "
320,Emily Dahl,"Chilling. This book has been compared to Gone Girl and I can see why: mystery, told from multiple perspectives with different timelines... Loved the British setting and the role of the commuter train. (view spoiler)[This is also almost a textbook depiction of domestic violence. The author really got to the power and control that the abuser had through manipulation, lying, and isolation, in both Rachel and Anna's lives. Particularly in the way she wrote about alcoholism, and the way that the abuser used Rachel's drinking against her, to spread lies and further isolate, control her, and tear her down.  (hide spoiler)]"
321,Annie Myers,"While this book does not rise to the level of great literature in my mind, it most definitely is engrossing and well written, with characters who, though flawed, you can really care about, and enough plot twists to keep the reader guessing until the very end. I would have rated it 4.5 stars if I knew how! One of those rare books that lived up to all the advance hype, for me."
322,Kerry,So glad I was finally able to get this at the library. I enjoyed the way the book was written - from three different points of view. It had me guessing up until the last 50 pages and then it hit me like a train (pun intended)! 
323,Jeff Tucker,"I think there’s been a little too much hype about this book but it is a good mystery. It’s written in the first person from the view point of three different women. It’s well written, moves at a good pace and was a real page turner at times. "
324,Hillary,"Well, this is strange. I quite nearly didn't even read this book, because everyone has been comparing it to Gone Girl. Frankly, that book was not great for me. This book, though - the character development of the three central women was excellent, and I found as I read that I could tell whose perspective it was without having looked at the chapter heading, which is not at all something common to all books written in this style (though of course it should be). As far as the whodunnit itself, well, I was pretty sure who the culprit would be well before the big reveal. That said, I remained engrossed. This is a real page (or screen) turner!"
325,Suzanne Crane,"This was non-stop, deliver the drama goods with a big handful of pathetic and in some cases despicable characters who make a constant parade of poor life decisions. This leaves their mixed-up lives in a 40-car pileup of a story that you cannot stop rubbernecking your way through. Just when you pause long enough to shake your head there's another totally preventable scenario, and you just can't stop until it's over. I did not love it, but I honestly couldn't put it down either. A good read, indeed if you can settle for some gross entertainment!"
326,Cherry,"Gripping, well-written, and well-organized psychological thriller that I found very difficult to turn off. I loved the voices of the British women reading it. Their voices really fit the characters. I can still hear them narrating in my head!This is also a fascinating look into the life of an alcoholic, though I can't say more about that without giving away plot points. It certainly also gets you looking at your routine surroundings a bit more carefully!I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because there is some, though not a gratuitous amount of profane language, particularly using God's name in vain, which, as a Christian, I don't appreciate. I do think she could have used other words and gotten the same effect, though maybe it does say something about the character who uses the most profanity.Overall, an entertaining read with well-defined and interesting characters.Some have compared this book to ""Gone Girl."" I have read both and there certainly are similarities as both books unfold the plot as you go along, but there is certainly less profanity in this book than in ""Gone Girl,"" which I appreciated and it's perhaps a bit less disturbing and ends more satisfactorily."
327,Tricia Douglas,"I would almost give this a 4.5 since the story was unique and exciting. The characters are well-developed. Every character seemed to have some sort of psychological problem that in the last 50 pages told the whole story. We find out the details of everyone's craziness in the end and learn who did what to whom. Hawkins has definitely written a top-selling novel and it's a book I'd recommend if you like suspense and fingernail-biting sequences. It wasn't a perfect book, but very close to it."
328,Jennifer Thompson,Couldn't put this one down. A great weekend read!
329,Andreea Lucau,"I read this book in a day and I rarely do this! It is very captivating, you get the feeling it gets a bit boring towards the middle and then it picks up the pace again.The book follows mostly Rachel, a divorced alcoholic, and her struggle to get over her failed marriage and find a new purpose for herself. Most of the action revolves around the train trips she takes from a small suburb of London to the city and back. On her journeys, she imagines various scenarios about the lives of the people living in house by the train track and she ends up becoming a part of one of those stories.The style, the theme and the ending, all reminded me of 'This Charming Man'.I end up thinking about what it takes for a relationship to work and how important trust is."
330,Angela Murat,"This is the first book of this genre that I read. First glance at the cover, I knew it was mysterious, yes, but i had no idea it would be so heavy. It deals with some very serious subjects, you get to plunge into what it's like to live the life of a very unstable woman, surrounded by also very troubled people Rachel has connections with. Alcoholic, heartbroken, financially challenged, not sure who to turn to, living her life with lies and betrayal... these pages have brought me to really realize what it must be like for many people today who actually live with such difficult lives. I never see murder in the news the same way again. I feel as if everything has a backstory now, no matter how simple. These characters are so complicated, the way they act, the unexplainable things they do... yet somehow I'm given the chance to analyze their behaviour and understand them. You never meet much joy in this novel, and it makes you realize how things aren't always as they seem. Details in life matter, and we are all connected. Facts, lies, truths... they're all connected by threads. I don't know if I liked this book. It impacted me and the mystery and uneasiness hit me hard and hooked me on. I had very high expectations, and they kind of fell a bit. I think all I have to really say is that this story didn't really make me feel good, but it made me feel something, and after all, isn't that what a book is suppose to do?"
331,Lynne Spreen,"I disliked this story in the extreme. I felt like I was trapped in the head of a disturbed person who had no prospect of help, no hope, and the only certainty in her days was the prospect of one (self-inflicted) disaster after another. It's compelling, well-paced, and well-edited, unfortunately, so I'm stuck giving it 4 stars. I read it because I needed to know if anything good happened, to anybody, by the end, and also, because it was my book club's selection and I didn't want to let them down. But ugh. "
332,Rachael,"Everyone in this book is pitiful and disturbing! Everything that happens in this book makes you want to personally reach through the pages and wring all of the character's necks! What a bunch of drunken, idiotic morons!!! Of course that means this giant hot mess of a story was SO much fun that I finished it in 2 sittings! I never, ever read books like this but for some reason, I was tempted and made my husband stop at Barnes and Noble for it. There is a first time for everything (a physiological murder mystery and him buying a book)! Ha. When he deposited The Girl on the Train into my hands, he said all the girls at the store loved it so maybe it would be entertaining. It was and I couldn't put it down!I was a little worried about content seeing how it was based on an alcoholics instabilities and her coping mechanisms whilst trying to figure out the mystery of a woman who vanished and her own possible role in the events surrounding her disappearance. All the while, she is stalking her ex, who also happens to be a lying, cheating pos. While there was definitely some profanity, and the content is very mature (talk of some drug abuse, an abortion, affairs, physical abuse, mental instability and of course murder) surprisingly, this was not an uncomfortable read. I would have hated tossing an expensive book into the trash...the author did a great job of delivering twists and turns and keeping a book of this nature on the up and up as much as possible.I stepped outside my box on this one and I think I may do it again sometime☺️"
333,Marjan,"Drie voor het verhaal, vier voor de spanning waarmee het boek me toch vasthield. Niemand is te vertrouwen en iedereen kan het gedaaan hebben. Had het op een bepaald moment door, maar dat is natuurlijk ook de bedoeling, zonder dat ik het gevoel had dat het voorspelbaar was. Ik heb er kostbare uren slaap voor opgepofferd :-) pageturner!"
334,Khyati Tewari,"A 4.5 rating!The book is written in self narrative of three women in form of their diary entries. It is an interesting format, but makes it a little bit difficult to grasp what is happening in the beginning when the time stamps of the three women is drastically different. It truly confuses the reader - I myself went forwards and backwards a several times. But once you get the hang of the events and their occurrence, you will manage to sail through easy.So, once you're into the story - it's a fast paced, nail biting mystery. Towards the middle of the book, I felt like I am not reading fast enough - as the suspense build-up was so strong that you just wanted to know who killed the lady; but there were too many loose ends to be tied before you could get to the centre of the whole mystery.It's a very nicely woven plot, the way the lives of the three women has been interlinked is so smooth. The suspense factor is great too as you cannot nail down one person - who is the murderer; you keep jumping the suspicion from one person to another as the story moves ahead and then back.But once the culprit is revealed, the story doesn't end quickly making it a bit of a drag towards the end. Despite that, the end is quiet unexpected.Leaving aside the two factors of the story, it being confusing in the beginning and a drag at the end (the reason for a 4.5 rating and not a 5.0 rating), it is a great read. A complete page turner which won't leave you disappointed rather wanting to know - what next? So pick it up and get ready for a roller coaster ride as you move through the lives of the three women."
335,Alexandra,"There's a very delicious underlying tension to Paula Hawkins' debut, The Girl on the Train. In a way, it's very subtle that it makes everything mysterious.I think the novel's strength isn't really the twists and turns of its plot, but just that underlying intensity, that psychological battle illustrated by the three completely unreliable narrators. The intensity, the uncertainty all translate from the pages and provide you with this tiny feeling of anxiety and curiosity, where you want to know what's exactly going on. I think it also helps that the characters are in a way unlikable, they're all morally wrong in certain aspects. Their undiluted immoral thoughts and actions present you with lots of doubts about their roles in the story. It presents the question of how exactly can you trust the judgement of a character when you know that they're morally corrupt? Basically, how well can I trust you if you're always lying or cheating or doing something that's clearly wrong?(view spoiler)[and you see this clearly illustrated with how the police take Rachel's testimonies (hide spoiler)]. So what does Hawkins really invite us to do with this novel? She lets us be the judge, jury and the executioner, as only we know what exactly goes on in the minds of these three protagonists. She weaves her tale in a slow pace, building up anxiety, allowing the reader to come up with their own decisions, conclusions on the outcome of the plot. She gives you unfettered access to the minds of her characters. You know their thoughts, and though the timelines and incomplete pieces of the plot are there to deter you from your path of judgement, you can start to decide exactly what kind of characters she creates. Are they good? Are they bad? What makes them the way they are? Is it their desires? Speaking of desires, can one truly go after what they want without taking into account the consequences it might have on others? Most importantly do your desires shape and mould you? Who are you really? What makes you? The Girl on the Train is a delicious gripping thriller that keeps your mind active and guessing on where exactly the train/story is going to turn. "
336,Elisa Doucette,"Five star story, four star writingOne of these ""can't put down"" books, the only reason for four star rating is that it can be a bit disjointed between the three women's stories. Perhaps a plot device, to keep the reader frenzied and confused, but it borders on distracting."
337,Shauna Hargrove,i wasn't sure i'd like this but i ripped through 90% of it in a day. very good.
338,Amanda - Go Book Yourself,"I know others have made comparisons to gone girl but I'm sick of those comparisons so I wont do that ;)Rachel is an alcoholic. She has lost her job because of her drinking but she still takes the same train every morning and evening because she doesn't want anyone to know. Every day the train stops at the same spot beside a row of houses. From there she observes the same couple everyday. Jess and Jason. She imagines scenarios between the two. They are the perfect couple, Jess and Jason.Except Jason and Jess are not their real names and their lives are far from perfect. One day she witnesses ""Jason"" with a woman who is not ""Jess"". Her perfect vision is shattered. A vision which she relied upon after the breakdown of her own marriage.Shorty after this incident she finds out that Jess ( whose real name is Megan) is now missing. She becomes obsessed with the investigation as she feels connected to the two. The story moves between several different characters but its held together well and it certainly kept me guessing. Almost all of the characters are suspects and honestly couldn't hazard a guess at who actually committed the crime. Overall its a well thought out and very believable story. The writing is convincing and gripping enough to make you keep turning the pages. I have a feeling we will see this on the big screen in a few years. "
339,Aviel,"Great, quick readThis was a great read, finished in a couple days as it really kept my attention. It felt a bit obvious but it was still enjoyable. "
340,Jade,"4.5 stars, really. This was one of those books that sucks you in. This, along with Big Little Lies, has broken my reading dry spell!"
341,Kari Dahlquist,"great writing. couldn't put it down, but I the characters are all so unlikable."
342,Lada Moskalets,"хороший повільний британський детектив, з психологічними нюансами. Всім жіночим героям - з перспективи яких і написаний роман - по-своєму симпатизуєш і сприймаєш попри все, як жертв обставин, то всі чоловічі по-своєму гидкі. Чимось нагадує похмурішу версію Бриджит Джонс, мабуть через британський колорит і Лондон"
343,Ann-Maj,This book is in between 3 and 4 stars. It was intriguing and throughout the book I couldn't wait to see what would happen next but I couldn't help but feel as if it was 'meh' version of Gone Girl with sections that bored me and went on for too long. 
344,Katherine Clark,"This is a 4 1/2 for me. I loved this book and found it annoying, all at the same time. I love how the narrator is portrayed--wonderful twist on my old favorite of the unreliable narrator, or is she? or hmmm. I did figure out quite early who the murderer was (and that is OK), and I did figure out quite early another one of the twists--part of the how unreliable is she part, but again that is fine. Nicely done shifts in POV, and I am not certain I've ever observed another book organized in this style. The author has each section marked with not only dates but morning and evening. Every section marked with name of character, date, and morning,and then a section for evening. Clever. I highly rec this book."
345,★ʜɑʋɘɳ★,3.5 StarsTL;DR:
346,Courtney,I couldn't put it down. One of those had to know what was going to happen next kind of books. Everyone in book club liked it.
347,Emily (BellaGrace),"This book is definitely this year's version of ""Gone Girl"". It was a fun fast read, and I liked it - but it's not something that has any re-read value. The ""who done it"" reveal at the end was obvious from midway through. But still - it was a decent entertaining read. "
348,Jenna~Ice Queen~Dreams,"Decent book. A bit too much at some points, but still pretty good. "
349,Jacqueline,"I enjoyed this one. What a relief. I expected to hate it as much as I did Gone Girl. Here although the main narrator was unreliable in that she drank very much to excess and couldn't remember things, I liked her and hoped things turned out well for her. Again, unlike GG, I didn't figure out until relatively late in the book who the bad person was. There was a fairly high level of tension as things began to be discovered and also tension revolving around Rachel's continual back sliding with the drink. I felt like the plot was reasonable and the writing was clear and the characterization was well done. You really routed for Rachel to dry out and figure out what was going on and eventually move on with her life."
350,Taryn,"I don't know if it really deserves all the hype it's recieved. It's not another Gone Girl, as has been implied by other reviews, but I thought the story was intriguing and entertaining. I don't want to be an alcoholic."
351,Pam,"I'm giving this 4 stars, but I'm rounding up...I really think it deserves 3.8 stars. It was such a page turner, and very exciting. Also, I am the type of person who sometimes sees strangers pass and thinks about the lives they live, so I enjoyed that aspect of this story as well. Idid figure out the mystery by about page 250...but I kept on wanting to read to confirm my idea (which was 100% correct), and because I enjoyed the writer's style of writing very much. I did feel a little like shouting at the characters by the end of the book - you know the way you do to horror movie characters ""Don't go in there!"" or ""Run Away, NOW!"" but of course they couldn't hear me, and so the ending scenes identify the book as a thriller. I would recommend the book because I didn't skim any of it, I liked the style and enjoyed the plot. Not the best book I've ever read, but still good. I would definitely read another book by the same author in the future. "
352,Michelle Finkle,"I'm blown away by this debut novel. It's was intriguing and suspenseful and kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end. I was utterly confused at the very beginning but this author does a beautiful job at building the layers of this story and piecing it all together as the story progresses. As I got deeper and deeper into the book, slowly each detail and the meaning behind it, clicks into place. But just when you think you have it all figured out, you realize you don't. It's not an explosive conclusion but one that will have you affirming your suspicions no matter how fleeting they were. If you liked Gone Girl, you will love this book. "
353,Milo (Bane of Kings),"The Review: http://thefictionalhangout.blogspot.c....""Rachel catches the same commuter train every morning. She knows it will wait at the same signal each time, overlooking a row of back gardens. She’s even started to feel like she knows the people who live in one of the houses. ‘Jess and Jason’, she calls them. Their life – as she sees it – is perfect. If only Rachel could be that happy.And then she sees something shocking. It’s only a minute until the train moves on, but it’s enough.Now everything’s changed. Now Rachel has a chance to become a part of the lives she’s only watched from afar.Now they’ll see; she’s much more than just the girl on the train…""One of my favourite movies of 2014 was David Fincher’s Gone Girl, a superb thriller that I’d recommend to anyone. Whilst I still haven’t yet read the book (something that I intend to remedy this year), when I saw that The Girl on the Train was being compared to Gone Girl, I leapt at the chance to request it when it appeared on NetGalley and as it turned out, it did not disappoint, turning out to be an excellent start to 2015 releases and something that rightly deserves the label as the next Gone Girl. It’s that good.The Girl on the Train is an interesting thriller that will grab ahold of you and not let you go. Whilst Gone Girl raises the question that your other half might not be who you think they are, The Girl on the Train looks at your fellow human beings. At a passing glance, they look average, ordinary, mundane. People living normal lives and doing normal things. But what if they’re not? What if there’s something that they’re just not telling you? The Girl on the Train explores this concept in great detail and will make you look twice at the people on your regular commute to work/school/wherever.This was one of those books that when I got stuck into it, I could not put it down. It’s a definition of a page-turner with that one more chapter feel lingering on the book. If you read one, you’ll want to read another. Mixed with its three unreliable narrators, (all female, all flawed), the book balances the aspect of the thriller with its developed cast. There’s Rachel, an alcoholic, and then there’s Anna and Megan, who both have interesting perks of their own. They’re certainly a welcome change of narrator to those thrillers that feature a sole male lead Detective hunting after a serial killer, and that’s in part why The Girl on the Train, despite the obvious Gone Girl comparisons, feels fresh and exciting. And above all, unpredictable, with several enthralling twists and turns.Rachel is the main narrator of the three and the only one mentioned on the blurb, so as expected, she gets the main portion of the book, although that said it is all written in first person with plenty of time spent between her, Anna and Megan. She’s picturing the lives of these two people who she sees on the train each morning, imagining out to be better than hers. Giving them names that she knows that they can’t be their real ones and letting the story play out from there. Until something bad happens, and that’s when the book really kicks in.Even though the ending may not be the strongest moment of the book, everything leading up to it is great. The small amount of characters works in the book’s favour and the first person narrative for all of them won’t really be confusing because the personalities are enough to distinguish who is who (also, the chapter titles are listed for each character). The blend in pace between each narrator also works, with Rachel’s moving a lot quicker than Megan’s story does. In another book, it would feel jarring and out of place, but with The Girl in the Train, Hawkins uses it to her advantage.The Girl on the Train is a very good way to start a year, I think. Whether it remains being one of the best novels of 2015 at the year’s end remains to be seen, but it certainly delivers a good impression right out of the gate as the first novel from this year that I've read. Also as a word of advice, you'll probably get the most out of this book if you read it on the train. VERDICT: 8.5/10"
354,Yvie,"This was a captivating mystery which all begins with the presumptions of, you guessed it, a girl on a train. It has all the elements of a good mystery: Lovers, murder, plot twists and a train, but it's genius is in the lesson that nothing is ever as it seems when viewing a story from only one angle. Perspective is everything. As I read, I was reminded of the importance of due process in our judicial system, and why current trends in ""rush to judgement"" sentencing via the internet are so dangerous. The omniscient perspective also gave pause as how perhaps God views our twisted interconnectedness with universal sorrow."
355,Samantha Pedroza,"Well damn! In the short-ish time it took me to finish this book I think I became and now am a recovering alcoholic with a new taste for canned gin and tonic. This is really fast paced and really well written. I don't typically like multi perspective novels but this one had a way of keeping the chapter book feel. I don't think of gone girl much other than infidelity but I will say if I had to relate it to a gillian Flynn novel it would be dark places (multi perspective and a character named Libby!) there were a few unanswered questions, or perhaps they were answered but not to my satisfaction,you can't win them all really. I look forward to reading more from hawkins and I will be recommending and talking about this book for a very long time."
356,Mackenzie Martin,"First part of the book was a very boring to get through but the last 60ish pages were well worth it. The characters were not very good, and slightly predictable in a way. The ending definitely makes up for it though. "
357,Karen Lindsay,"I loved the writing style and chronology of the unfolding story. It was an addictive read, I was so engrossed one day on the tram I didn't notice the ticket inspector until a hand waved across my kindle. Having said that or perhaps because of this I was left disappointed with the end. Having so cleverly woven the threads of the story I felt the ending was clumsy not necessarily the outcome but its execution."
358,nia,probably leaning more towards 3.5 starsreally liked how flawed the characters were!!! this book was great but i think its inevitably forgettable 
359,Matt Fitz,"Thanks to e-books allowing multiple readers of a publication, decided to read this at the same time as my wife where normally I would have to wait until she was done (or vice versa). Good story and would generally agree that it had a Hitchcock-ian feel to it. Great set of characters and you see them in deep texture thanks to the 1st-person narrative style used by the author. She switches from one voice to another so pay attention to whom is the narrator for each chapter (I was little careless initially and had to back up when I didn't catch the narrator switch). First ""thriller"" by the author and she does the genre justice. She's got a background writing ""chick-lit"" and you sense a little of it here, but hope she can duplicate this effort."
360,Allyce Cameron,"Utterly gripping. I raced through this in a couple of days, if I'd had a weekend I probably wouldn't have stopped! The characters are all terrible. Well written, realistic, but terrrible. Drunks, homewreckers and just plain mean. However this didn't lessen my enjoyment of the book. I don't read a lot of thrillers, but I thoroughly enjoyed this and didn't guess the ending until I was meant to. Highly recommended."
361,Tracey,Predictable ending didn't spoil my enjoyment of this book. I couldn't put it down. 
362,Coenraad,Rachel is het meisje in de trein en zij reist ieder ochtend naar haar werk in Londen en ‘s avonds weer terug . Iedere dag hetzelfde saaie ritje met dezelfde saaie mensen. Iedere dag stopt de trein op welke reden dan ook bij een rijtje huizen in de buitenwijk van Londen. Hier heeft ze dan iedere dag een kijkje in andermans leven. Op een dag ziet ze in de tuin van Jason en Jesse “ze noemt het stel zo omdat ze de echte namen niet weet”iets liggen. Ze gaat met dit gegeven naar de politie en dan komt ze in een zaak terecht waar ze niet in betrokken wilt en mag zijn.Dit boek is het debuut van Paula Hawkins en heeft veel media aandacht gekregen. Het boek bleef me aandacht vasthouden ondanks al deze aandacht en van A.W Bruna kreeg ik het boek toegestuurd. Ondertussen had ik me wel al voor genomen om me niet te laten beïnvloeden door alle aandacht die het kreeg.In het begin moest ik wel erg wennen aan de vrouwelijke personages en haalde ze ook nog weleens door elkaar. Ondanks dat er bovenaan het hoofdstuk vermeld stond om welke personage het gaat. Megan het tweede verhaallijn in dit boek speelt zich af in het verleden maar wat hebben die twee verhaallijnen met elkaar gemeen.....Paula heeft de vrouwelijke personages ieder een eigen stijl gegeven en dit is ook te merken aan de schrijfstijl tussen de personages. Zeker in het begin had ik totaal geen idee welke kant het verhaal op zou gaan. Ik vond dat het zeker in het begin wat duister en wazig. Maar gaande weg het verhaal werd het verhaal duidelijker maar toch werd ik menigmaal verrast door een wending in het verhaal die het steeds boeiender maakte om te weten hoe het eigenlijk allemaal in elkaar zou steken en wat nu de waarheid is.....Niets wordt er te vroeg prijsgegeven van het plot integendeel zelfs. Spanning wordt opgevoerd en dit is ook te danken aan de personages die allemaal zo hun eigen stempel op het verhaal weten te drukken en te behouden.Het boek leest vlot en is boeiend tot op het einde.Het heeft me enorm verbaasd dat dit een debuut is . Kwaliteit straalt het uit en ben zeer benieuwd naar haar volgende thriller en naar de groei van haar schrijfkunsten.
363,Mina,"There was more than one moment in this book that had me on the edge of my seat or saying ""What?!!"" The main character was a train wreck and I was determined not to like her. The only reason I didn't give the book five stars was that I had a hard time determining who was talking at times. There was quite a bit of date jumping and so I found that annoying/difficult on an e-reader. Overall - Great Story. Really happy that I read it as a book club selection - we had super discussion about it. "
364,Athina,"There is a girl on the train. Same train, every morning. Watching out the window, inspecting the scenery, looking at unknown people. Every day. Until she starts noticing a couple. The same couple on their deck, drinking coffee, kissing or just sitting. Then what is unknown becomes familiar and when the woman goes missing, Rachel, just has to help the police because what she saw from the train may be the answer they're seeking.A girl on a train. How many times have you got on a bus or a train, following the same route to work or to school. Don't tell me that you haven't noticed those who are around you, don't tell me that you haven't took a peek out of the window.A woman buried by the train tracks, old clothes tossed aside. Rachel's story drew me in from the moment I started reading. Her recounting was so vibrant, emanating pain, misery and I knew before she told me that she was a troubled woman. So I was more than excited to meet her and Megan, the woman on the deck, even if I knew she would go missing, I was longing for her story too.To my surprise the story is told by different POVs. We see Rachel, her complicated life and her obsession about Megan. But we also see Megan's POV, but a year earlier. So you understand how tension builds up. We follow the events, unfolding back and forth in time which is exciting. Later in the book there is another female narrator adding her parts of reality to the story. And the thing is that everybody lies.There are secrets, hidden secrets, some known only to certain people and others we have to figure out ourselves. So the image we get while reading the book is as fuzzy as the scenery before us while the train moves fast and away. Blurry letters on the page, that's how it is. And I absolutely loved it.There is a certain appeal in damaged characters that I can't really put a name on it. They emanate a mystery waiting to be solved, but mostly, I believe, is the promise of salvation. Can we really get close to the edge and don't fall? That's the human nature, pushing ourselves to the limits and if we survive, then it's another projection of ourselves we pull back from the emptiness.Enjoy the quotes. And read the book.""One for sorrow, two for joy, three for a girl, four for a boy, five for silver, six for gold, seven for a secret never to be told.I've got a few of those.""""Hollowness: that I understand. I'm starting to believe that there isn't anything you can do to fix it. That's what I've taken from therapy sessions: the holes in your life are permanent; You have to grow around them, like tree roots around concrete; you mould yourself through the gaps. All these things I know, but I don't say them aloud, not now."""
365,Linda ,"I don't want to give anything away. The story is compelling, but hard to read. I kept going, but didn't want to. I knew early on how it would play out because of the character so thinly developed, and I wondered why. My favorite part of the writing: the voices. Oh those voices, those women that I wanted to yell at and hug all at the same time. Others have disliked it, others have praised it. Haven't you always imagined things going on behind a window as you walk in the evening? The story of Rachel begins with her view as she sits on the commuter train, watching as her old neighborhood goes by. Her state of mind makes things imaginary become real, and so the story begins, with Jess and Jason, a love Rachel sees as something she's lost, something to gain back? Paula Hawkins has had Rachel throw that pebble into the pond, and the ripples widen and widen. It's quite a story."
366,Sandra ,Excellent .
367,Rawles,"The reviews on this book are mixed. And it is very similar indeed to Gone Girl, even if the author did start writing it before that book was published. So that sort of bothered me.However, I could not put this one down! I read it in two days flat. This is a real page turner. Rachel lives a sad broken life, taking the train every day into and out of London. Living vicariously through the lives of the people she spys out the train window, one day she sees something that she cannot forget. She decides to get involved.And then the trouble begins.In part a treatise on alcoholism and personal responsibility and partly a glimpse into all sorts of behavioral illnesses and memory, this book goes in many different directions at once and seems chaotic until all the parts suddenly converge with devastating results. Some beautiful commentary on what it means to be a woman and what we use to define our worth - both from men and regarding motherhood - makes this a killer of a book.;-)"
368,Lenore,Unreliable narrator done well.
369,Hanje Richards,"Can't tell you much without spoilers. So you are going to have to believe me when I tell you that although substantially different from ""Gone Girl"" this thriller will have you just as caught up in it's intricately woven web. I don't read a lot of thrillers, but a good one is a great bit of escape reading for me. Alcohol and memory are important elements in this story. If you like psychological thrillers, I would say this one is for you."
370,Bücherwunder,"Schon lange wollte ich dieses Buch lesen, allerdings auf Englisch - und war mir dann doch nie ganz sicher, ob es mir wirklich gefallen würde. Als ich dann schließlich sah, dass ""Girl On The Train"" (hurra übrigens, dass der Titel beibehalten wurde!) auch auf Deutsch erscheint, KONNTE ich nicht mehr widerstehen. Und ich wurde nicht enttäuscht.Man muss gestehen, dass dieser Roman (und ich möchte deutlich darauf hinweisen, dass es ein Roman ist und kein Thriller) vermutlich nicht Jedermanns Sache wäre. Denn der Erzählstil ist eher nüchtern und ruhig. Man spürt, dass die Geschehnisse auf eine Katastrophe zulaufen, nähert sich dieser jedoch in langsamen Schritten. Denn (und das macht in diesem Fall den Unterschied zu einem Thriller aus) es geht darum, die kaputten Persönlichkeiten der Charaktere kennenzulernen und weniger um atemberaubende Spannungsmomente. Die Charakteristika eines Thrillers sind teilweise durchaus vorhanden, doch ich fand es auch sehr interessant zu beobachten, in welche (abgründige) Richtung das Leben sich manchmal entwickeln kann - ob man nun will oder nicht. Schade fand ich ein wenig, dass ich ab einem gewissen Zeitpunkt zu großen Teilen ahnte, was hinter den Geschehnissen steckte, doch das konnte meinem positiven Gesamteindruck keinen großen Schaden zufügen.Ich bin froh, dass ich mich endlich dafür entschieden habe, dieses Buch zu lesen!"
371,Flashette,This is a good thriller. The next Gone Girl? Not quite (in my opinion). 
372,tilda,"This book was so good. The writing was amazing, and though I had some trouble getting into the story, I enjoyed every minute of reading. "
373,Alice Spades,"não foi o que esperava. a escrita e a forma como estava escrito relembrou-me do Dark Places da Gillian Flynn, que não foi exatamente o meu livro favorito. gostei deste livro, mas achei um bocado meh. tho não tenha previsto logo o plot, acho que demorou muito e continha muitas coisas que não eram necessárias. gostei da Rachel e do percurso dela como personagem. percebo a hype, mas para mim não foi extraordinário tho tenha gostado da história em si e me tenha relacionado um pouco visto que devido à universidade, ando muito de comboio."
374,Nicole Wallace,"Great mystery! I had not read any fiction in a while and I was not disappointed. Some language and inappropriate content for young readers, but other than that a really good book. "
375,Estela Duran,"This was the first book I've read where there are three lead female characters and all are flawed and messy in every way possible. Each monologue felt so real, so raw and ""un-pretty."" The story itself kept me laying in bed at night wondering where Megan was and if this was going to be another Gone Girl, in London. However, it was not like Gone Girl, instead it was this unique story, with characters intertwined in a cluster-fuck of everyday struggles to be human. Lies, deceit, murder, babies, alcoholism, and love. Paula Hawkins executes these intriguing theme with time jumps, perspective variation and plot twists. I recommend this book to anyone seeking a thrill and some truly screwed up people to invest your life in (I, of course mean this in the most enticing way possible)."
376,Barbara Hale,"This was a gripping page turner that kept me up late into the night to finish it. Set outside of London, Rachel takes the train to and from work every morning. Rachel is a heavy drinker and as she spirals into uncontrollable alcoholism, her world unravels. She is newly divorced. Rachel becomes obsessed with a ""perfect"" couple whose garden backs up to the train track. Twice a day, when the train stops at that particular stop, she sees this perfect couple and imagines what their lives may be like. Then she witnesses something tragic and becomes obsessed with finding answers. But her alcoholic brain gets in the way. What really happened? "
377,Krissyb,"Like a train wreck you can't take your eyes away from. Pun intended. I completely ignored my children in favor of reading this and finished it in 24 hours. Thought I had it figured out too, but no. "
378,Vivian,"You see so much riding on a train everyday. Familiar faces. Familiar places. People's homes. You catch a glimpse of their lives. The lives of those just off the tracks. Like Rachel. Rachel drinks too much and too often. She's ashamed of what she's done but even more ashamed of what she can't remember. Then there's Anne. Anne has taken Rachel's place in life, literally. She's taken her husband and her home. Down the street you'll find Megan, who tries to maintain as normal a life as possible. But she just can't seem to shake her demons. Hawkins does a really good job formatting the stories; the way they are set and intertwine is really good. It tends to get a bit confusing when it starts unravelling, but overall, very good."
379,Laly Arce Chumpitassi,"Lo he acabado y OMG!!!!!Debo reconocer que me costó muchísimo engancharme porque las primeras 20 páginas estaba totalmente perdida en la historia, pero conforme todo va avanzando vamos conociendo a Rachel y a los demás protagonistas. Nos vamos metiendo en su cabeza y vamos entendiendo (o no) sus acciones. El final fue buenísimo y a pocas hojas de acabar estaba ansiosa por saber cómo terminaría esta historia. Definitivamente está super recomendada!"
380,BurgendyA,"This book was a very thrilling tale. It totally had me enthralled with the curiousity of this intising mysterious web that Paula Hawkins weaved. This is the first novel I've read of Hawkins. I really enjoyed it until the ending, as the ending of the book I though it could've been better. The plot was good & the characters I got mixed feelings about them throughout the story. I can't quite say that they're relatable or at least in my opinion. I would recommend anyone to read this book."
381,Ksenia (vaenn),"Треба усвідомити очевидне: мене лякають британські трилери. Мене лякають британські соціально-побутові трилери. Мене лякають британські соціально-побутові жіночі трилери. Спочатку Elizabeth is Missing, від якої хотілося сховатися під ковдру, але ковдри не було - було лише крісло в сидячому Хюндаї. А тепер от - ""Дівчина у потягу"".Звісно, якщо намішати _правильний_ коктейль - налякати нескладно. Взяти упізнавані ситуації, дрібні побутові маркери, багатьом (чи я помиляюся?) добре знайомі дзвіночки депресії чи паранойї, а потім додати ще кілька інгредієнтів із радикальнішою дією - ненадійного оповідача, відголоски божевілля, трохи впевненості, що в кожної стіни є вуха та ікла, а рідний дім - ніфіга не твоя фортеця...

Тільки банальність та стандартність не рятує від того, що одного літнього дня світ може тріснути. І життя перетвориться на жахіття так спритно, що й не встигнеш це зафіксувати. оце насправді й страшно. Хіба ні?"
382,Muthiah Prabhakaran,"THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN -- I chose this book to read, because its the best thriller which is released in this year. In the first few chapters the author's writing is inspired me a lots. I read the book which have the similar writing style(GOT), still I'm inspired.This book evolves around 2 pair's life, sometimes feels like very complicated too. Rachel, Tom's ex-wife travels in the same route in train which stops in a same place for a signal. There, she used to see a happy couple(Scott and Megan) who are living near to tracks. They are happy, always together sitting in the balcony. Rachel admired them, wanted to live with her ex like them.Rachel's ex, Tom lives near to the Scott family. Tom is very happy with his wife Anna, child Evie. Rach is alcoholic, always drinks whenever she is free. Once she drinks, she won't remember anything. One day, when the train stops, Rachel saw Anna is kissing passionately a guy, not Scott. Rachel is shocked, broken on seeing this. On the same day's night, Anna is missing. The day she went missing, Anna drinks and came to meet his ex. In the next day, Anna was in her flat, with lot of wounds. The police tries to frame Scott for Anna's disappearance. Rachel alone knew that they are happy and she had relation with someone else. Rachel is desperately trying to help Scott by remembering what happens when she visited near their place.This book never lay the clues to find the criminal. Until last few chapters, It never unveils the truth. Coming to the characters, Rachel is framed as very pitiful one. The love failure people can relate lot of their thinking with Rachel.Totally, Its not a feel good book, but an entertaining thriller."
383,"Hazal ""Elenda""","Kesinlikle diyebileceğim ilk şey bu kitabın ""talihsiz"" olduğudur. Bir kere karşısında tapındığım Gone Girl gibi bir rakibi vardı. Ben de bunu frsat bilip tüm kitap boyunca sürekli ikisini karşılaştırdım ve bunu yaparken büyük bir keyif aldım, hatta kendimi durduramadım. Argh! Gerçekten büyük talihsizlik. Yine de kesinlikle hakkını vermek lazım. Karanlık atmosfer, kusursuz cinayet, creepy karakterler zinciri ve elbette sonu tam olması gerektiği gibiydi. Bir ara bu yazar çıldırmış olmalı diye bile düşünmüştüm. Okurken büyük keyif aldım. Şimdi filmini bekliyorum anacım *galp*Ayrıca neden 1 puan kırdığımı anlatmalıyım ve bunu yaparken Gone Girl ile kıyaslayacağım (Elbette) EŞŞEK KADAR SPOILER BUNDAN SONRASI xD -Gone Girl'de suçlu(?) bize yazar tarafından kitabın daha yarısındayken verilmişti. Bu nasıl olabilirdi? Bizim merak etmemiz gereken şey bu değil miydi zaten! Bundan sonrasını -yani her şeyi- bilirken nasıl kitaptan keyif alabilirdik ki? Değilmiş işte... Yazar mindfuckların kralını yaşattı! Bu kitap hala benim biriciğim <3 -Trendeki Kız'da ise yazar geçmişte okuduğum türdaş kitapların izinden giderek suçluyu son bilmem kaç sayfada bize imalarla buldurtmaya çalıştı. Ama asıl amacı ""Vuaaaaa demek suçlu oymuş."" nidaları attırmaktı. Gel gör ki daha kitabın başında şüphelendiğim tek insanın suçlu çıkması canımı sıkmıştı. Bir puan kırdım ben de canım. O kadarcık da olsun hani :3"
384,Kassi,"The very last scene of the book left me with chills. This book was a nail biter. I mean even though I figured out the culprit early on, but it didn't diminish the experience for me. The author had me second-guessing myself. The characters are unbelievably flawed. There's nothing to love about any of them. They would make great character case study. You think you know them, but then a couple pages later, you're like wtf?!!If you're a fan of Gone Girl, I highly recommend this book. It's not too drawn out as Gone Girl so that's always a plus. :-) If you're looking for romance, look elsewhere. Happy reading!"
385,Alice,"The concept of a girl who commutes to London daily on a train, and who gets a vicarious thrill of watching the lives of people inside these houses, is quite creative. We learn soon enough that she actually has an agenda when she becomes embroiled in their lives and sets in motion a series of events that lead to dire consequences. I thought the story line to be very strong, however the interior dialogue written for three of the women players in this drama is identical. I had to check back as I was reading to remind myself whose head I was in. That said, the book held my interest to the very end.
"
386,Cathleen,"I won't be the first nor the last to say so, but of all the books that have purported to be the next Gone Girl, this is the one that best taps into the varied appeals of that story. The bits of history that are strategically revealed, the characters that treat themselves almost as badly as they do each other, the competing unreliable perspectives, the red herrings, the staccato pacing, the compounding of conflict, and the collateral damage -- all are represented here, and not in a copycat way. As a longtime commuter, I was ripe for the premise, and though the themes were dispiriting (to say the least), it is an exciting ride.My next book needs to be one in which not all people are horrible.audiobook note: It is the high-quality narration which tips this review to a fourth star. In print, it would still have the tense, can't-look-away, twisty qualities, but the talented readers bring out the touches of humanity, flawed as the characters indisputably are, in the three points of view. I was especially taken with Clare Corbett as Rachel and Louise Brealey (Sherlock's Molly Hooper!) as Megan, who are equally excellent. India Fisher's Anna was a bit grating, but that may actually be to the narrator's credit, given the character beats with which she had to work. All in all, a riveting listen. "
387,Robyn Schultz,Really Good easy book to read. I enjoyed it
388,Arianna ,"4.5 Trust no one’ Stars!!

“Life is not a paragraph, and death is no parenthesis.”

If you want to read a gripping mystery/psychological thriller that will blow your mind, this is the book for you. Well written with a very well done plot, “The Girl on the Train” is told from multiple (three) POVS. I love a dual POV and I also love a multiple POV if it's well done and necessary. And here it really was. I liked to be in these characters' minds. In my opinion the author did a really great job with the three character’s voices. All three of them felt unique and like me you will experience so, so many feelings reading their story. While they were interesting, I can’t say I liked any of them. But it was ok. I don’t expect to like all the characters I read about and here the reader is not meant to like them. All of them are flawed, all of them have insecurities and fears and because of that all of them felt real and in some way even relatable. I liked the pace of the story. At times the story was slow paced and I think for some readers it will be a little boring, but sometimes the story was so fast paced and intriguing. Needless to say, the pace of the story really worked for me. Rachel the main character of the story is very well developed and even if I didn’t like her too much I sympathize with her. As for the other two important women in this story, I really liked how they are portrayed. For me the most intriguing character was (view spoiler)[Tom (if you read the book you will figure out why) (hide spoiler)].The plot is complex, layered and the suspense is fantastically done. The story is told from first pov and IMO the author did a great choice writing this novel in this way. Obviously since this is a mystery/psychological thriller there are many twists and turns and most of them I didn’t see them coming. I really don't want to give too much away, because this is a book you need to experience for yourself, but I will tell you this – the story will keep you guessing and I’m pretty sure you will not be able to put it down.All in all, “The Girl on the Train” was a great engaging suspenseful read that for sure will keep you at the edge of your seat. Recommended read!!

“One for sorrow, two for joy, three for a girl, four for a boy, five for silver, six for gold, seven for a secret never to be told. I’ve got a few of those...""

389,Paul,"I hesitated buying this book due to all the hype it has received and the comparisons to Hitchcock as well as comparing it to a Gillian Flynn book. Books with this much hype, rarely live up to it, and I figured this book would be no different, but when I was at Barnes & Noble and between it being on sale, my member discount, and a coupon I think I got 60% off and figured at that price it was worth it. It turns out it was well worth it.For a first time book it was very good. The story flows well the only similarity to Gillian Flynn is that this book is also told in the past and present and from multiple viewpoints. The outline on the book flap is accurate a girl on a train sees something out of the ordinary and that unleashes a number of events. The reason the book doesn't get five stars is that it is really hard to sympathize or want to root for any of the main characters, each is morally, emotionally, or psychologically bankrupt in one way or another, but for a first book it kept my attention, kept me wanting to Finnish the story- even though the reader will likely figure out the perpetrator of all that goes wrong- at least by half way through the book, but it is doubtful the reader will understand the why until the very end which is why the book works.It will be interesting to see what this author does next."
390,Emilie,"I had to marinate on this one a few days. I liked it, I really did. Good storytelling, good narrative writing, characters I both loathed and sympathized with at the same time (which is tough to do), and an excellent sense of place and atmosphere. A solid mystery with a bow that tied a little too neatly for my liking.And that's where it misses on that ""5 star"" element for me. I want to finish a thriller feeling a bit gobsmacked by what just happened. I want a little messiness, a feeling of WTF? I don't even mind a few loose ends, things to think about when it's over, that sense of ""what would be on the next page if this hadn't ended?"" I felt that with Gone Girl. Kind of like ""oh man, what is going to happen NOW?"" and I thought about the characters for days. Note I didn't say I LIKED the characters. In ""Girl..."" it was difficult to find a character to root for. By the time Rachel got some chutzpah, she had already annoyed me for 300 pages. Here, within the last 50 or so pages, the whole story became clear, and what I didn't already guess, the killer handed over on a silver platter. Those sociopaths sure like to talk. Rather than there being some huge revelation of OMG! at the end, I realized a bunch of whiny, self-absorbed boring people had all basically screwed each other. Again, that isn't necessarily a negative review, just an expectations v. reality observation.So I don't know...I recommend it as a good read. But don't go into it hoping for a hero or a heart-pounding thrill ride of a roller coaster. It ended up for me feeling just like a commuter train-trudging along, filled with crazy people and people who would rather be anywhere else, back and forth, same route, same mistakes, same view, over and over and over...."
391,Kyle Warner,"‘The Girl on the Train’ is one of 2015’s most popular books. Sometimes I feel the need to seek out the biggest bestsellers not because they sound particularly interesting to me but rather because I want to know what everybody’s reading and why. So, why did Paula Hawkins’ debut novel ‘The Girl on the Train’ become such a huge success? Well, I don’t know, exactly. As much as we’d like to think there’s a science to these things, there really isn’t. But it helps that the book is good.Rachel is a depressed alcoholic with holes in her memory. She rides the train every day to create the illusion that she still has a job. On one of the stops that brings her close to her ex-husband’s home, Rachel stares out the train’s window at a happy couple. She has named them Jason and Jess and she dreams up all sorts of scenarios of their happy life. Rachel lives in fantasies, dreaming about other people’s joy because she has none of her own. One day, she spots Jess with another man, and all those fantasies fall apart. When Jess – real name Megan – soon goes missing and is presumed dead, Rachel takes it upon herself to investigate, because she knows about the other man. But Rachel’s not looking to help so much as she is looking for something to do. She wants – needs – to be a part of something bigger, something more. So, she weasels her way into other people’s lives, creating lies about how she knew the missing Jess/Megan, in an attempt to feel useful again.The book is told in first-person from three different points of view: Rachel, Megan, and Anna the woman who stole away Rachel’s husband and lives the happy life she always wanted. Every character’s voice is different from the last and one never feels lost with the shifting first-person POV. It’s really well written. Perhaps most interestingly is that these different narratives are nonlinear, making the story into puzzle with a few pieces missing until the most opportune moment. This format is especially useful for creating tension as we come to the end and certain secrets are revealed. In fact, I’d say that the book’s finale is the best part, as the truth of the past comes to light at the same time that the characters in the present teeter on the edge of life and death.I was struggling with something for most of the book but by the end I was sure of it: I don’t like anyone in this story. Not really. Everyone’s a liar, a cheat, and in some cases violent and malicious. Megan’s cheating on “Jason”, Rachel says she’s trying to do the right thing but she’s doing it for all the wrong reasons, Anna is mean-spirited and ugly, and almost all the men are controlling or potentially violent. I liked Rachel most out of the group because it’s clear she has issues and can’t always help herself. But I wouldn't ever want to know these people.My Goodreads friend Alejandro compared ‘The Girl on the Train’ to Alfred Hitchcock’s ‘Rear Window’ and ‘The Lady Vanishes’. I had the exact same thought while reading the book. Like ‘Rear Window’, our Rachel views something from afar and only has a few of the necessary pieces to the mystery, but she can’t stop herself from getting involved. And like ‘The Lady Vanishes’… there’s a train and a lady vanishes. In a lot of ways, I think ‘The Girl on the Train’ would’ve made a good Hitchcock film. I think it works better as a mystery than it does as a thriller, personally. (Perhaps it’s worth noting that I read more thrillers than I do mysteries.) The twists in the mystery are unpredictable and I can honestly say that I didn’t see the end coming. If you want to call it a thriller, then I’d say that the tension could’ve been ramped up a bit. But as a whodunit, ‘The Girl on the Train’ is solid.‘The Girl on the Train’ is an impressive debut. It’ll be interesting to see where Hawkins goes next."
392,missEvi [can't commit to a book],"What happens when you put the thoughts of three detestable women in a book, and add a crime to the mix? If you are thinking disaster you would be wrong! It's like the bad accident that you can't look away from. It made me feel bad about myself because,I have to admit, it brought out the worst in me. I felt like someone who is peaking into another person's life, to see their misery and secretly feel good about himself. I feel like the slime won't go of. "
393,Ingha,This one had me at the edge of my seat and I could not wait to find out what happened at the end!
394,Brenda,"This fast-paced mystery, set in England, was a great first read for 2016. Although, the plot became pretty predictable, it was engaging to the end and makes one wonder if they ever really ""know another person. "
395,Kissmekate,"Rachel ist eine unter Tausenden von Pendlern, die täglich im Großraum London mit dem Zug unterwegs sind. Jeden Morgen und jeden Abend fährt sie dabei an einem Haus vorbei, in dem ein junges Pärchen wohnt, das sie gerne beobachtet und um sein scheinbar glückliches, sorgloses Leben beneidet. Rachel hätte auch gerne einen Mann, der sie liebt, und ein schönes Zuhause. Stattdessen lebt sie, mehr geduldet als alles andere, seit ihrer Scheidung im Haus einer Freundin und ist zu einem übergewichtigen Trauerkloß mutiert - wobei Übergewicht und Niedergeschlagenheit bis an den Rand der Depression nicht einmal ihre einzigen Probleme sind. Den liebenden Mann und das schöne Zuhause hat ihr Anna weggeschnappt. Anna, die schlanker, hübscher und erfolgreicher ist als Rachel und ihr den Ehemann ausgespannt hat.Eines Tages ist die junge Frau, die sie so häufig auf der Terrasse oder im Garten gesehen hat, spurlos verschwunden. Die Polizei geht von einem Verbrechen aus, die Presse stürzt sich auf das merkwürdige Verschwinden der attraktiven Megan ... und Rachel weiß etwas über den Fall, doch die Ermittler nehmen sie nicht wirklich ernst.An ""Girl on the Train"" kommt man diesen Sommer kaum vorbei. Und das zu Recht!Dieser Thriller-Bestseller ist kein bloßer Marketing-Hype, sondern in der Tat clever konstruiert und mitreißend geschrieben. Auf zwei Zeitebenen und aus drei Sichtweisen - Rachel, Megan und Anna - wirft die Autorin nach und nach diverse Puzzleteile des großen Ganzen in den Raum und spielt dabei sehr geschickt mit Perspektivwechseln, die immer wieder dazu führen, dass man das, was man vermeintlich über eine Figur oder ein Geschehnis zu wissen glaubte, völlig neu bewerten muss.Die drei Hauptfiguren haben allesamt ihre charakterlichen Abgründe und kommen beileibe nicht immer angenehm rüber (vor allem Anna war mir oft herzlich unsympathisch), doch ich fand sie bei allen Absonderlichkeiten, die zum Vorschein kamen, glaubwürdig, als könne man ihnen genau so in der Londoner U-Bahn begegnen.Das Buch ist kein klassischer Krimi und auch kein Thriller nach dem üblichen Schema. Um die polizeilichen Ermittlungen geht es nur am Rande, vielmehr stehen die Lebenswirklichkeiten und Gedankenwelten der Protagonistinnen im Mittelpunkt und immer wieder die Entdeckung, dass nichts ist, wie es scheint, und man niemand wirklich trauen kann.Lobend erwähnen möchte ich zum Schluss noch die ausgezeichnete Übersetzung von Christoph Göhler. Sehr gelungen!"
396,Carole Dent,"Wanted to see what all the fuss was about, and flew through it. It's a long time since I read so I didn't even notice the train had stopped and emptied...It was emotionally exhausting being in the minds of these women and their sufferings, and the varying mental states of the main character were really well drawn. I was quite willing to leave them all behind at the end. Just an aside about reading it on the Kobo, I couldn't 'flick back' easily to compare the non-linear dates of the entries which was a bit frustrating sometimes. After a while it didn't matter so much."
397,Michele,I kept putting this off because of all the comparisons to Gone Girl. This was SO much better. 
398,Kristin Maceroni," Megan is still missing, and I have lied – repeatedly – to the police.	It had to be something to do with Saturday night. I must have done something. I must have committed some terrible act and blacked it out.Paula Hawkins’ The Girl on the Train is a rare read. One to be obsessed about and contemplated when not in hand, and mourned on its completion. It is like a trip on the Express Line, fast and jolting, with an abrupt stop at the ride’s end. Both exhilarating and infuriating in their actions, Hawkins’ multiple narrators are unreliable, unlikeable, and yet somehow empathetic. You will not know who you are cheering for, or why, until the back cover closes. Rachel, a divorced alcoholic, takes the 8:04 commuter train to London every weekday. Only, Rachel isn’t going to work. She hasn’t worked in two months. Part cover so her roommate/landlady won’t learn of her unemployment, part obsession so that she can peer into the home along the line that she once shared with ex-husband, Tom, and a desperate grasp at the normalcy that her alcoholic lifestyle is slowly stealing from her, Rachel’s commute is a daily trip closer to utter disaster.As Tom’s life with his new wife, Anna, and their baby girl moves forward, Rachel’s life moves backwards. She shifts her train window gaze from Tom and Anna’s house to that of a ‘happy couple’ four doors away. Rachel gives them imaginary names and projects all the hopes and dreams of her unfulfilled life onto these two complete strangers. However, when the ‘happy wife,’ whose real name is Megan, goes missing, Rachel may be the only one with a clue as to what may have happened to her.Reminiscent of E. Lockhart’s brilliant We Were Liars, and Christopher Nolan’s movie, Memento, The Girl on the Train compels the reader to constantly question the truth, motivation and actions behind each and every character. And like it’s often compared to predecessor, Gone Girl, it is a book whose characters and story you will not easily shake.I’m actually giving it a 4.5 out of 5 stars. After all the twists and turns of this wild ride, I found the ending rather predictable and lacking one last shock.The Girl on the Train"
399,Alissa,"This book took me a little while to really get in to the story. Told from multiple points of view, the story is a little confusing to start. Rachel views the world from the windows of the commuter train she rides to and from work. She makes up lives for the people she sees. When a woman goes missing, Rachel becomes a very unreliable witness, even in her own eyes. How do past events change when viewed through a different lens? Lots of twists and turns as both the reader and Rachel realize the past isn't always what it looks like."
400,Inês Silveira,"The only reason I'm giving this book 4 stars instead of 5 is its slooooooooowness. justgetonwithit.Seriously.I really like a good mystery and a good build up with character development, but this dragged a bit too much.Also, it was quite refreshing to read a story where you're not meant to like any of the characters: Megan was damaged and obsessive, Anna was a complete d*** who I'd just punch in the face, and Rachael just didn't do herself any favours. (view spoiler)[And Tom. I listened to this book, so as Tom was confessing his affair with Megan I was walking home from the train (LOL!)and my face constantly looked like this  I would seriously like to spit on his face. His fictional character face.  (hide spoiler)]The story was interesting though, even though I only got really hooked towards the final third (when things ACTUALLY happened)."
401,Raquel,"Foi bom, não foi espectacular. É viciante e prende o leitor e as páginas desapareceram rapidamente, mas o final não foi surpreendente. Não foi previsível também, foi apenas ""adivinhavel"". Teria recebido as cinco estrelas se me tivesse apanhado desprevenida, que é a melhor parte de um bom thriller. Para melhor livro de 2015 e explosão de vendas, confesso que esperava um pouco mais. É um livro fácil de ler e diferente, no sentido que foge a clichés, e definitivamente um óptimo livro para ler em comboio ou metro pelos capítulos curtos, mas não é inovador. Consigo apontar um par de thrillers tão bons ou mais que não são records de vendas. Porquê? Não faço a menor ideia. Os melhores livros raramente estão nos tops. Ou então talvez seja realmente difícil inovar e surpreender os leitores nos dias que correm.Estamos a assistir à continuação do fenómeno que Gillian Flynn mediatificou, que são os heróis com perfil anti-heroico, com claros defeitos e vícios e às vezes repulsivos, mas que, não obstante, conquistam o carinho dos leitores. E isso é bom. É bom ter novas vozes a contar histórias. Ainda assim, confesso que na minha opinião não superou Flynn. Não obstante, é um must read, mais não seja para podermos opinar sobre o livro que toda a gente leu."
402,Dan Ries,"I rounded up from 3.5 stars. I did enjoy this book. It may not have been the most riveting and complex thriller but it definitely kept me wanting to turn to the next page. I liked how Hawkins gradually provided several interesting and in some cases dramatic personal experiences in several of the main characters’ pasts that helped me understand (while not necessarily justifying) the reckless, irresponsible, selfish things they did during the course of the story. SPOILER ALERTI’m wondering a couple of things. For those who determined “who’d done it” too early on – how early was it that you saw it coming? For me, the DNA not matching Scott or Kamal basically pointed to the only other possible male character in the book – Tom. I didn’t think anything prior to that tipped me off at all and I didn’t feel that was too early for the “reveal.” I was still interested to find out how the whole story and especially the night of Megan’s disappearance unfolded. My second question is this – did Megan also sleep with the psychiatrist? Hawkins dupes us into thinking that several of the events (attempted phone calls, conversations, trysts at the Swan, etc.) were with Kamal. We come to find out that they were actually with Tom. But what about the passage, that is definitely Megan with Kamal, which says “I step forward, closing the gap between our bodies, stand on tiptoe and kiss his lips. He doesn’t pull away from me.”? That led me to believe that Megan did also sleep with Kamal. But then later it seems that Megan is pretty certain that there are only two potential fathers of her baby – Scott and Tom. Without getting into a discussion about birth control – does Hawkins leave it to our own imaginations or did Megan and Kamal have sex? I’m sure I could have missed something, so I’m hoping to get some input."
403,Jerilyn,"Very Gone Girl-ish in the telling, a very good read, highly recommended. If this is just the author's debut novel, wow, I expect more fascinating thrillers down the road.The characters are exceptionally believable, the storyline is plausible as well. For me, this was one of those books that you start to read faster and faster towards the end because you can't wait to see what's going to happen next.This should be your next read!"
404,میعاد , كتاب رو دوست داشتم! داستان خيلى عجيب و تازه نيس ولى سبك نوشتن و توضيح داستان برام جذاب بود! فقط يه داستان جنايى و پليسى نبود! در كنارش داشت به مرزهاى انسان هم اشاره ميكرد كه چطور ميتونه عوض شه! و چطور ميشه حتى نزديك ترين كسايى كه كنارمون داريم رو نشناسيم!!
405,Ari,"Might contains spoiler!I've been thinking, why I cant give it a solid 5 stars. I do enjoy the book immensely, I even stay up late to continue the reading because it was such a page turner. Well, maybe it's the characters. There's no characters to root for. Rachel was not an easy to like character. She's a heavy drunker, have no self willpower, I'm constantly want to slap her on the back! But then, maybe how the characters crafted was part of the charms.Then I realized that I felt the ending was a bit off and sort of anti climax. In the end, there's not clear whether a certain person was convicted as murderer of Megan.And to describe this story, there's Indonesian proverb says ""the neighbor's grass always looks greener""RECOMMENDED!(nevertheless) "
406,Lyn,"Sucked me in from the start. Excellent characters, but Rachel wore on me. Biggest complaint is that at the beginning, Rachel and Megan had the same voice. So glad I didn't figure out what was what before the main character. Well played, Ms. Hawkins. Definitely worth another read. Soon."
407,Debbie Shoulders,"I HATE mysteries. Why? Because I have this need to know the ending now, and end up reading the book in one setting. ""The Girl on the Train"" by Paula Hawkins was no different.It has been classified in the same category as ""Gone Girl"" and I wouldn't put it there except to say you have an unreliable narrator (really three unreliable narrators.) Hawkins created a fast paced narrative but did not have the ""Wow Factor"" of ""Gone Girl."" Rachel, an alcoholic takes the train into downtown London each day and in doing so passes the neighborhood in which she lived with her former husband. Her view of this place allows Rachel to see into what she perceives is a fantasy couple, that she calls Jason and Jess. They seem to have everything that Rachel does not.One day Rachel discovers the identify of her fantasy heroine, Megan. Megan has gone missing. Rachel realizes that on her daily train ride she may have seen something that will provide a clue to Megan's whereabouts. The only problem, though is that Rachel's drinking often leads to black outs with large pieces of time missing.In addition to Rachel, the reader is treated to the ideas of two more ladies who are also unreliable given to episodes of lying and cheating. So where is Megan? Hawkins treats the reader with a narrative that flows with action and characters that resemble real people. They are all flawed which makes guessing who done it that more difficult. This is a first novel for the author and I look forward to more to come."
408,Hilary,"Do you ever think about the people around you? Sometimes, when I'm out walking I make up stories about the people I see. I try to read their body language, to interpret what the little looks and pauses in their speech might mean. It's a more overt reading between the lines. I think everyone does it to some degree, especially on commutes where you're going to be seeing the same people every day. Most of us don't start to believe our fantasies, however. Most of us don't end up injecting ourselves into the other people's lives.Rachel Watson, on the other hand, does just that.Rachel's daily commute takes her past a certain house where she often sees the inhabitants out in the garden. She watches them, and the affection they show for one another. She makes up stories about what a wonderful life they must lead. All of her own wants and dreams are soon pinned on this ideal couple, until one day she sees the woman out with another man.What on earth happened?When the next day the woman goes missing, and Rachel can't remember just what she did the night before, the stage is set. The Girl on the Train has been touted as an answer to  Gillian Flynn's  Gone Girl. It's easy to see why the comparison exists. Both books play with time and perspective to further the mystery. Both books play, to some extent, with unreliable narration although I believe that  Paula Hawkins did a much better job of it. Both books deal with missing people, and deeply flawed individuals. I believe that where  The Girl on the Train succeeds is often where  Gone Girl failed.  The Girl on the Train was, ultimately, more believable if only because it dealt with less manipulation and more flawed 'normal' characters attempting to do what they believe to be the right thing.The action starts from page one, as does the intrigue. If you can put the book down after hitting page 40 I'd be deeply surprised. The writing style reminded me a great deal of  Patricia Highsmith, and I don't say that lightly. The book kept me guessing, turning back through the pages to double-check dates, rushing forward to get to the conclusion. Right up until the final page the action didn't stop. It was an electric, riveting, train crash of a book.I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to scratch that mystery itch. This is one of the good ones."
409,Thomas Johansson,"This was a very well told mystery, using three different narrators in three different women. Solid recommendation to anyone who likes a good mystery novel."
410,Carla Anderson,I could not put this down. Perfect pool side weekend read. 
411,Tina,"Åh.. Denne er ""latterlig"" lettlest. Jeg leste den norske versjonen. Ordene bare flyter avgårde og der er godt å bare være med på mysteriet. Rachel tar samme toget til London hver dag og på et fast stopp ser hun huset til Scott og Megan. Lager seg historier om livet dems. Så ser hun noe som kan forandre alt, i bare de sekundene hvor toger står i ro, så forandres alt. Ja, dette er virkelig en god bok. Språket veier opp for historien, som har sine svakheter. Den fortelles av tre forskjellige kvinner i historien, enkelt å holde følge.Definitivt en bok jeg kan anbefale!"
412,Helen Marquis,"The unreliable narrator / witness is a mainstay of literary fiction, so a bitter alcoholic quasi-stalker who drinks herself to blissful oblivion on an almost daily basis is probably not the most believable of witnesses-turned-investigators. However, as it turns out, the ""heroine"" of this tale, Rachel, turns out to be far more astute than you'd first give her credit for.She proves to be a very frustrating heroine, as her lapses as she tries to get sober are infuriating, however very real in the world of a recovering addict. It just makes it harder for other people to take her seriously, especially when you, the reader, know she's right!There are some unnecessary deviations from the main plot, but on the whole, this is a real page-turner as you follow Rachel into the recesses of her memory to try and find out what happened, formulating theories as crazy as her own along the way. I suspected several of the main characters at some point or other during the book, but as the pieces fall into place and the denouement reveals itself, it's a satisfyingly tense end to proceedings. A great thriller that will keep you guessing. "
413,Stephanie Jewell,Great twisted story!
414,Katlynn Brooke,"A suspenseful read; I could not put it down. Every time I thought I knew what was happening, I was wrong and another twist in the plot occurred. I would recommend this book for anyone who enjoys a good psychological thriller."
415,Jackleen,What a train wreck!
416,Lee,"My friends and I were out on a road trip when we decided to stay in a mall for a few hours. Of course, I had to go to the nearest bookstore and buy a book (this has become a habit). When I found this one, I thought, ""How expensive!"" and almost turned my back. Fortunately, I was pretty desperate to come home with a new book with me, and because I couldn't find one that I wanted to give a try (I bought my own copy of George Orwell's Animal Farm, though, but I kept thinking to myself that it wasn't enough), I picked this up, quite reluctant but happy.For the next two days I committed myself to reading. It was a busy week—we had to catch up on countless projects before the screaming deadline lay its body upon our shoulders and mock us until even our own nightmares wish to leave. And indeed it slapped me on the face, non-stop, telling me how stupid I was for reading such a useless book while my school work lay underneath my nose, utterly unnoticed.But it's been quite a while since I read a book that's incredibly gripping and disturbing. It just happened that I had read online what would happen in the end so the entire journey was pretty lame. But that somehow didn't make the entire story less terrible. Terrible characters, terrible writing (I don't write good stuff myself, but I don't think I have to be an all-time writer to know how excruciating it was to go through Hawkins' writing), and a terrible—oh, terrible—plot. What is there to ask for? The terrible stuff placed in this book is enough. I had sleepless nights and less conversations with people. These, I have proven, are just some of those happenings that imply that I am completely in love with a book.I do not highly recommend this. But this surely is one hell of an entertainment. Two thumbs up for that!"
417,David Pimenta,"Devia ter escrito sobre este livro quando o acabei de ler. Nem sei porque nunca aconteceu porque o devorei e uso este termo de uma forma literal. Todas as minhas entranhas se revolveram à medida que o fui lendo e, como é evidente, o meu lado de fan boy de thrillers esteve sempre presente. Li-o em Agosto, na minha semana de férias no Verão, e não podia ter escolhido melhor época. No momento em que estava mais descansado, a relaxar de todo o trabalho de escritório.Não foi à toa que o burburinho sobre 
A Rapariga no Comboio
 começou a espalhar-se. Não sei até que ponto a escritora, a talentosa Paula Hawkins, estudou todos os clássicos do género policial mas conseguiu fazer um bom trabalho. Por puxar pelo quotidiano de grande parte dos leitores – as pessoas que encontram muito tempo para ler nos comboios, identificando-se instantaneamente com o cenário do enredo – e saber criar um enredo tenso, de certa forma muito negro. Rachel, a protagonista, apanha todos os dias o comboio para disfarçar a tragédia e a miséria em que a sua vida se transformou. Com um divórcio nunca esquecido e sinais de depressão, observa as mesmas casas e os mesmos passageiros nas suas viagens. Mas, aos poucos, observa que algo de errado se passa com um casal que observa todos os dias, à janela do seu lugar no comboio. Todo o mistério começa aí e agarra o leitor de uma maneira incrível.Espero que a Paula Hawkins regresse com algo tão aterrador como este livro. Sabe tão bem ler policiais bem escritos. "
418,Kristal,"I didn't like this book quite as much as many people seemed to. I felt like I was on to what was going on too soon and the ending wasn't a big shocker to me. That being said, I did finish it in a few days so that says something! An easy read that doesn't require a great amount of thought... A great book for reading with four kids as background noise. "
419,Dave,"Reading through the reviews on Goodreads, you would think only women have read this book. Well, I've read it too and it's a good one. It's true, women might find this more appealing a story than a man; the three protagonists are all women as well as the author. The plot alternates between their points of view, unwrapping the mystery of how the three characters are connected. This Rashomon- like device is a pretty effective way to tell this kind of well crafted thriller. It's riveting and suspenseful and in the end that's all one really wants from a book like this- an entertaining diversion."
420,Les,Actual Rating: 4.75/5 (Terrific!)Review to follow.
421,Ankit,The character build up and the description of addiction is one of the best I have come across. She describes even the most normal of events with such detail that they are riveting and you can't put the book down 
422,Chris,"A well written psychological thriller that delves deep into three female characters dysfunctional situations and how their lives are truly connected. The novel started out a bit slow, but began to steam roll about half way through as the author started connecting the dots of Rachel, Megan and Anna and the continual lying, cheating and distrust from the people in their lives. Fast read, with a ""Gone Girl"" type ending that makes the reader keep guessing and wanting more! "
423,Abby,"WARNING: This review may contain indirect spoilers.Wow, what a whirlwind this book was. The entire book up until the last 5-7 chapters I was positive that it was Dr.Abdic. But no, no, no that was the simple answer to the crime but the real answer was hidden away until I finally realized in the end who the killer was. There were points in the book that were gripping and held me on the edge of my seat so I would read a lot at a time. Yet, other times were extremely boring and repetitive especially when she was going through her alcoholic cycle of drinking and hangover day after day. I gave this book four stars because I thought it was great apart from the repetitiveness during the beginning before things started heating up. But once things did heat up, I was pretty hooked.In regards to the movie that is coming out based on Girl on the Train, which comes out later this year:I feel like it is going to be terrible. I am looking forward to watching the movie but I know that they will never be able to put in all of the twists and turns that this book has which makes it so interesting. Nevertheless, I know I will be going to see it anyway. ^_^"
424,Marla,"I'm hoping that Gone Girl hasn't become a new formula for debut thriller authors. I loved Gone Girl, but jeez...find your own style. This is similar to Gone Girl in many ways. It's written in the first person, is told by multiple characters, someone disappears, e.v.e.r.y.o.n.e. in the book is F*'d up some to the point of being mentally ill, no one is likable and the author doles out a little at a time to reel you in...people seem normal to begin with and then she reveals slowly they're seriously twisted. All of them. Hawkins leads you from character to character thinking ""this is the culprit"", only to lead you on to the next character. It wasn't a little like Gone Girl, it was A LOT like Gone Girl.But I'm giving it four stars for the pure entertainment value. It's cleverly written and while the first 100 pages were slow for me, I flew through the last 2/3. It's like one of those guilty pleasures you don't want to admit to having...like not being able to look away from a train wreck (heh). One thing this book DID do for me is, the next time I hear ""it's the new Gone Girl!"", I'll probably steer clear. I've done Gone Girl TWICE now. Time to move on."
425,Magda Pais,"Maria e Vanita, aqui vai a minha opinião. Tenham medo... tenham muito medo. Foram vocês as grandes culpadas de eu ler este livro e por isso haverá consequências...Não sou, por norma, pessoa de ler o livro da moda. E confesso que este livro, além de ter sido moda no verão, as opiniões iam do excepcional ao lixo, o que me fazia alguma confusão. Tinha, por isso, previsto não ler o livro, pelo menos nos próximos tempos. Mais tarde, depois da poeira assentar logo leio, pensava eu. Mas depois veio a opinião da Vanita e a seguir a Maria a tentar-me, que até me emprestava o livro e tudo para eu não ser expulsa de casa e pronto, li o livro.Comecei na segunda-feira e aproveitei a espera ontem enquanto decorriam os bypass coronários do maridão para o acabar.Rachel viaja, todos os dias, para Londres de comboio. O seu entretêm é observar as pessoas que vivem nas casas, especialmente um casal a quem ela chama de Jason e Jess. Sem que os conheça, Rachel imagina que a vida deles é perfeita. Tal como era a sua com Tom, antes de ele a trair com Anne.Megan é casada com Scott e é tudo menos a esposa perfeita.Contado a três vozes e a dois tempos, nem sempre conseguimos saber exactamente o que se passa porque Rachel, a rapariga no comboio, bebe em excesso e não se consegue recordar do que se passou ou do que viu. Recorda-se duma coisa aqui, doutra ali e, acima de tudo, tem a sensação que algo se passou sem saber exactamente o quê.Confesso que, de início, estranhei o facto de Megan contar a sua versão da história começando uns meses antes da narrativa de Rachel. Mas passando a estranheza inicial, é um livro que se lê bem. Podia, talvez, ter mais ""sumo"" e, talvez, ser menos previsível. (ou então sou eu que, depois d'A Verdade Sobre o Caso Harry Quebert de Joël Dicker fiquei mais exigente). Também confesso que acho que chamar este livro de thriller arrepiante é capaz de ser um bocadinho de exagero. Confesso ainda que não senti aquela ânsia de ter de largar o livro mas não querer fazê-lo. Mas esta parte pode ser porque foi o livro perfeito para o dia de ontem - quando me chamaram a avisar que a operação tinha terminado eu tinha acabado de ler a última página.No geral direi que foi uma excelente leitura e que valeu a pena ler este livro. Recomendo!"
426,Cheri Lesko,"I don't know if I have ever read a book before where I felt sorry for every character. from the beginning, it keeps you intrigued."
427,Alie,"Finishing this book at 2:00 am was well worth it. I tend not to read thrillers and I stared this book knowing absolutely nothing about it except for the fact that a lot of people seemed to enjoy it. I can now say that I am also one of those people! The story started out a little slow, and yet I still found myself captivated from the beginning and as the plot moved forward, things only became more intriguing. I honestly found myself feeling super tense as I read the last half of the book. However, I was a little bit unsatisfied with the ending. Overall, I really enjoyed it, though!Definitely recommending this novel! "
428,Supratim Bose,"I had very high expectations of this book. It is the winner of the Goodreads Choice Award 2015 in the Mystery & Thriller category and a lot of my friends had praised it highly in their reviews.The story is narrated by three characters - Rachel, Megan and Anna. Rachel is the "" the girl on the train"". She is a an alcoholic whose cheating husband, Tom, had divorced her for Anna. Still she is unable to let go of Tom and keeps calling, texting him and has even retain's Tom's surname. For her drinking problems Rachel has been fired from her job and just takes the train to London to keep up the pretense of still having the job. She wallows in self pity and even though she senses contempt not only from her landlady & her boyfriend, random stranger in the train etc. she can not clean up her act. While taking the train she observes a couple whom she has named Jason and Jess every day and one day she observes some thing about the couple and it gives her a jolt. Later it is found that the Jess, whose real name is Megan has gone missing and Rachel decides to play detective.The three narrators of the story are flawed in some way or the other: Rachel with her substance abuse issues which her destroyed her confidence and self esteem, Megan fighting her own demons from the past and present and Anna is also shown indulging in to activities, which by her own admission, reminds her of Rachel.The mystery is decent but at times Rachel's behaviour is a bit annoying. I know she is playing the part of a damaged human being but still. The identity of the culprit was a bit too easy to guess also. But overall, it is a good book to read and I would recommend it to people who enjoy psychological mysteries."
429,Laura Gelinas,"""One for sorrow, two for joy, three for a girl. Three for a girl. I’m stuck on three, I just can’t get any further.”I started reading The Girl on the Train, thinking that it would be similar to Gone Girl, implied by the book's blurb. I was happily relieved to find that it was much better in fact, since I wasn't a big fan of Gone Girl.Right away, I was drawn to Rachel, the initial narrator and main character of this book. We meet her while she is riding the train into London, a bottle of pre-mixed Gin and Tonic in hand. Not sure what her purpose each day is, but I got the sense that she liked to drink from the start. She seems beaten down and depressed, and I was curious about what got her to this point. Everyday it seems, she rides the train and at the broken signal, gets a glimpse into a row of Victorian houses that sit close to the train track. It's in one of these homes that Rachel catches the site of an attractive couple, and she is attracted to their seemingly perfect, happy life. But things aren't always as they seem, are they?“Twice a day, I am offered a view into other lives, just for a moment. There’s something comforting about the sight of strangers safe at home.”I don't want to say too much, since this book keeps you guessing, but it was a gripping page turner that I thoroughly enjoyed!"
430,Natalia Duane,"There is so much I want to say, but I don't want to spoil anything! Let me think what is ""safe"" to say...Ok, first off, my jaw dropped a couple times- literally- which is always a good sign. I haven't read Gone Girl, so I can't compare them (as everyone seems to be doing) but I definitely think this book was sufficiently filled with mystery to make it interesting, but not to the point where it would seem completely unrealistic. Also, I loved the different perspectives, and how they juxtaposed each other so well. Although I really enjoyed this book, I had some problems with it, one of those being that the start was kind of slow. Also, I thought some of the characters were a bit two dimensional, and this prevented a lot of the character development I was hoping for. But, needless to say, this book was definitely worth reading (or listening to)! I would really recommend someone to listen to this book on audiobook, because the narrators were really good! "
431,Julie wright,"Not quite as intense as Gone Girl, but still along the same lines of psycho-thriller craziness. I don't know why I keep reading these anxiety invoking books. I liked it, but don't really recommend it to my friends on goodreads. "
432,Katie Wood,"I listen to books, so I can't say it was hard to put down. Instead, it was hard to stop listening to it. I liked the way the perspectives of the different women narrators were woven together. I liked the whole fantasy of being on public transit and imagining the lives of people in the buildings regularly passed. It's sort of what I did in my youth on MARTA buses when I was miserable living with my mother and fantasizing about living in the various houses and apartment buildings that I passed on the way to school or work. There is an interesting discussion of this book in the Slate.com Audio Book Club. I think I liked it better than they did. I'll be interested in what my own book club thinks about it when it comes up in our Fall rotation."
433,Corene,"Four stars given grudgingly for this much touted British thriller. Rachel watches the backyard of a particular house on her morning commute as the train sits at a stop on its way into London. She sees the couple who live there, imagines their lives, even assigns them names. When the news announces a missing person, Rachel realizes it is the woman from the house and finds herself involved in the case. What started out as an intriguing premise with its unreliable, unlikable narrator became disappointingly pedestrian, the plot a perfect fit for a Lifetime movie. Bumped up a star in my rating, due to the way it kept me reading to see how it would all resolve; similar books usually leave me increasingly bored through the second half. I just don't understand the hubbub and acclaim for this one, though."
434,Renata,"A fun, fast read with plenty of interesting twists and turns. Not deep, not complex characters, but an action plot whose characters often had mystifying motivations. I enjoyed the opening concept of the young woman creating lives for people she sees each day from the window of her commuter train. I think it is something many of do - create stories of the lives of people we see often in passing. Of course we are often quite wrong but luckily don't have to deal w the consequences as the girl on the train does."
435,Donnah Brown,"I really enjoyed this book, which is strange, given that I didn't like any of the main characters to start with. First there's Rachel, the main narrator, who although you at first feel pity for, you soon come to despise. Then there is Megan and Anna, both of whom appear to have it all, but are disatisfied. The author has been very clever with the narrative of this story, she introduces a character who seems perfectly rational, then allows you to get to know them, gradually revealing the truth about their character. This is a story that is very well written, cleverly it weaves the lives of the three women in and out of the narrative, by linking them closely with each other's lives. I couldn't put the book down, I just wanted to keep going until I knew truth. Definitely a must-read."
436,Chris Blake,"None of the characters in this runaway best-seller are likable. There's Rachel Watson, the protagonist, who is a bitter, unemployed thirty something woman who is obsessed with her ex-husband and rides the train to London each day as if she is still working. When a young woman goes missing, Rachel makes a series of incredibly dumb decisions in an effort to find out what happened to her. And she's the best of the lot.Then there is Megan Hipwell, the woman who disappeared. Rachel observes Megan and her husband, whom she has dubbed Jess and Jason, on the terrace as a loving couple during a signal stop each day, and she fantasizes about them as the ideal couple. They are anything but. Megan is a drifter who got into prostitution and drugs as a youth and has a dark secret. And finally there is Anna Boyd, a cold seductress who stole Rachel's husband, Tom Watson (I couldn't help but think of the professional golfer). Anna is calculating and hateful toward Rachel, though with good reason as Rachel is prone to stalking her and showing up drunk at the house where she and Tom once lived.Suspects abound as the hunt for Megan progresses. There is her husband, Scott, who is jealous and occasionally violent. There is her therapist, with whom she had a fling. And there is somebody else in her life.Paula Hawkins has crafted a tightly woven mystery that gains steam as it progresses. The reader won't want to put this one down. She leaves little clues along the way, inviting the reader to guess who the real killer is after Megan's body is discovered. I had it all wrong, which is the sign of a skillful mystery writer.I would recommend this book, though the writer didn't make me care enough about any of the characters, save for Rachel."
437,Cameron,"I did not see that.. But then again, I really suck at figuring out who did things in mysteries and thrillers...... OH WELL! I still thought it was good, the writing was quite addictive. I totally see why people are comparing it to Gone Girl. If you liked Gone Girl this is definitely for you"
438,Whitney- Reader's Candy,"Oh goodness... I just finished this one and to be honest, I feel exhausted! It was complex, well thought out, and had tons of twists and turns. I really enjoyed the story, but it took me a few days to finish it because you had to pay attention to the simple parts. Each and every word played an intricate part in the story as a whole. The Girl on The Train pulled me in with the creep factor and tangled me up in a web of lies. My mind was working double time trying to figure out what in the world was going on. The characters were so complex and weird... I started off thinking that Rachel was disgusting and hopeless, but then with a faint of heart, I started to feel really bad for her. She wasn't right in the head and I knew the secrets would slowly reveal themselves.They compared this story to Gone Girl and I would say that's an accurate comparison. If you are looking for a book with sexy scenes though, this book probably isn't for you... Yes, there were intimate interactions, but the Author just grazed the surface by mentioning and moving along.I would definitely recommend this book to readers looking for a good book that leaves you thinking.... What in the heck just happened? Please remember though, it is slow at times because in order to follow the story you need lots of details and the Author gives us LOTS of descriptions and little points you think are non sense at the time. They do play a crucial part in the end though!"
439,Laurie Stahl,"Great book! Once you get past the first couple chapters and get used to the writer, it's an easy read. You never know where this story is going until the end! Very suspenseful!"
440,Mags Delaney,As entertaining a read as Gone Girl made all the more real as I know the places in the story having travelled up and down the same railway line for years. I like the story from different voices technique. Rachel is the kind of character that makes you pity her but also want to shake by the shoulders and say sort yourself out woman! I hope if it does get filmed it's not 'Americanised' as I think it's English setting adds to the 'behind closed doors' tension. If you read and liked Gone Girl you'll like this!
441,Maria Dimitrova,"Давам 4 звези с уговорката, че са толкова, а не 3, заради самия сюжет, защото като история книгата ми бе интересна, има съспенс и се чете лесно и забързано дори. Но откъм литература е слабо - тези кратки, накъсани, стенографични изречения ми натежаваха, когато четях повече страници последователно без почивка. Добре, че прекъсвах покрай работата. Същото се отнася и за героите - и женските, и мъжките образи сякаш не се различават един от друг, те са ""копи-пейст"" с почти никакви отличителни черти като персонажи. Когато четях за Том, все едно ставаше дума за Скот; Мегън и Ана са същата работа. Донякъде и Рейчъл (главната ни героиня), но някак си(за щастие), тя изпъкваше повече. На другите не успях да повярвам. С две думи, интересен сюжет, а книгата ""става"" за моментите, когато не искате да се задълбочавате много-много и не търсите сериозна литература."
442,Demet,"Bazı kitapları çevirisinden okuduğuma pişman oluyorum. Bu da onlardan biri. ""Cinayetin cinsel bir maksatla yapıldığına dair delil olmadığını söylüyorlardı."" Cinayet dediğin işlenir, yapılmaz ki :( Bir de elimdeki 12. baskısı."
443,Kristy,"Rachel is an alcoholic who is struggling to keep herself together after a messy divorce. Riding the same train every day, she finds herself making up stories about the people and houses she sees along her route. When she sees something unusual, she becomes a part of a missing persons investigation that changes her entire life. I compulsively read this book in about five or six hours, with just a couple of breaks. It's not perfect by any standard, but it was definitely a page turner for me. The book, as everyone knows, has been compared endlessly to ""Gone Girl."" I actually probably enjoyed this more than ""Gone Girl,"" which like, but not as much as some of Flynn's other books. Oddly enough, I did read ""The Girl on the Train"" the day after watching ""Gone Girl"" on film for the first time, so all of that was swirling in my head.No one in this novel is particularly likeable, though Rachel has her moments. The book is told from the viewpoint of three different women and each has their own personality and character flaws. Hawkins is adept at drawing you into their worlds and their feelings. I found myself somewhat mesmerized by Rachel and the mess she seemed to consistently get herself in. About three-fourths of the way through, I though the story lagged a bit, and then picked up at the end. There's a point where I found myself rooting for Rachel, despite all of her flaws, and that's pretty impressive. All in all, the book wasn't as much of a deep psychological thriller as some, but it was an oddly intriguing portrait of several individuals. I'm glad I picked it up, even if for a few hours. "
444,Krista,"Great story about damaged goods. Perhaps that's why I could relate. Perhaps that's why anyone could. We're all such a mess of bad and good, of secrets and pain, of the capacity for compassion and joy and hatred and addiction, aren't we?"
445,Aaron,"I loooooved having an unreliable narrator. Get it together, Rachel. I also have a thing for books where you hate most of the characters so this was right up my alley. I raved about this book while reading and was shocked that members of my book club who already read it said it would not make a good discussion. That is, until I got to the end and was quite literally like ""oh."" There's really nothing substantial to discuss. I wanted jaw dropping twists and turns and instead was left feeling hungover. But in all, it's a fun read. "
446,Brittany (brittk0486),"This one kept me on my toes! I really enjoyed the mystery, even though some of it was a bit obvious. "
447,Jeannette,"I love a good twisty-turny mystery, and that is what Paula Hawkins has presented here. While the three women whose stories comprise this book are not the most likable, they are fascinatingly flawed. I was completely intrigued by them, and the only one whom I couldn't get behind despite those flaws was Anna. She really struck me as a total witch until the end. Regardless, I loved the unreliable narratives that make the reader question what parts of each story are real and what parts are exaggerated or imagined due to the characters' paranoia and neuroses. It made me question a couple of times my own hypotheses on what actually happened to the victim. I did finally deduce the truth, but when it was revealed in the story, my blood still ran cold, and I think that is the mark of a really well-written thriller. There were a few times when the characters were a little too over the top or cringe-worthy in their various neuroses and I did have to wrinkle my nose at those, but in the end, it didn't stop me from turning the pages and wanting to know what was next. It was a very noir-type story, a style which I adore, and I ended up blowing right through this novel."
448,Kristi,"I have trouble reading thrillers, as the predictability and ridiculousness of many of the situations is just too much for my eye-roll reflex to handle. This book was different. Yes, what I guessed would happen about 1/2 way through did end up happening at the end, but I was not 100% sure - I was kept guessing what the specifics of the situation were until almost the very end. I hated having to putting this book down when my 45 minute trip to and from work concluded each day - I always wanted more. Rachel's blackouts, and switching between three different narrators made the story really intriguing and kept the book moving at a really high pace. As a bookseller, you often hear ""this book is the next Fifty Shades/Harry Potter/Rosie Project"", but in this case, the ""next Gone Girl"" label is actually fitting. Looking forward to seeing this book take off, and let the ""next Girl On The Train"" comparisons begin!"
449,Martha,I read this in one day. I wanted to know about the characters and their stories. I loved the writing. I really enjoyed the narrative and how the author slowly merged the timelines. I loved the idea of the protagonist not being terribly likable. Truly I got rather frustrated and disgusted by her but wanted her to seek help. I felt like I would like the person behind the alcohol. If you liked Gone Girl and stories like that you will like this. 
450,Tudor Ciocarlie,"This was an extremely intense and heart-breaking audio-book, but the exploration of what it means to be a woman these days is very different from what Gone Girl is doing."
451,Nelie,"First I want to say that I listened to this as an audible audiobook, partly during a long drive but then had to keep listening after because it absorbed me so much. It uses different first person narration, all female and that can sometimes be confusing in an audiobook but not in this case. Also I sometimes find it distracting in audiobooks when a male voice reads a female characters lines or vice versa but that wasn't the case here, maybe because when it happened it was meant to be a first person female narrator saying the males lines (if that makes sense). So I recommend the audiobook version of this (which hasn't been rue for several audiobooks I listen to). Next I have to say I really loved this book, perhaps because I was a train commuter for a year or two in my twenties and was always curious about the glimpsed backyard lives I would go past. I also loved that even though the main protagonist is a blacking out alcoholic with a life in crisis, I found her highly sympathetic and in particular her descriptions of the grief of still feeling love for an ex after they have moved on (BTDT as they say though thankfully I didn't deal with it the same way). I'm surprised so many reviewers here said no one was a sympathetic character. It's true every person in this book is behaving badly in one way or another, but I felt a great deal of empathy for her as well as for the victim. Won't say more to not give spoilers. I do agree with others that the who done it wasn't that surprising by the time it was revealed but I didn't find that took away from the story since I was more curious about how it would be revealed...in general highly recommend this book as long as you can feel empathy for highly flawed people struggling to be better, which apparently some other reviewers here found difficult."
452,Carly Krewitsky,"I can definitely see the similarities between this book and Gillian Flynn's book Gone Girl. Both are about the disappearance of a married woman. In this book, the married woman is found dead. Of course, the police suspect that her husband murdered her. In Gone Girl, Amy Dunne disappears, and her husband Nick is accused of her murder. Amy turns out to have faked her death and run away; she also happens to be crazy. Both of these novels deal with marriages, infidelity, and lies. I like how in The Girl on the Train, the main character is an unreliable witness. Rachel is a drunk whose husband Tom cheated on her with a woman named Anna, whom he's now married to. Rachel lost her job and won't leave Tom and Anna alone. She calls Tom constantly because she wants to talk to him; she stops by Tom and Anna's house uninvited. Rachel takes the train to work everyday; after she loses her job for being drunk at work, she continues to ride the train on a daily basis. She becomes obsessed with watching Tom and Anna's neighbors Megan and Scott while she's on the train. One day, she sees something out of the ordinary which gives her a reason for living. She tries to become sober. I thought it was really interesting how Rachel had blackouts and couldn't remember the things she did and said when she was really drunk. She tries her hardest to remember if she saw Megan on the day of her disappearance. Like Gone Girl, the characters in The Girl on the Train are rather despicable human beings. The only ones who are slightly likable are Rachel's roommate and Rachel's mom."
453,Sheyla Franco,"Complete Review: http://mislibrosyresenas.blogspot.com...Me gusto. Aunque Rachel ha sido una de las protagonistas mas molestas que he leído, el libro me tuvo curiosa todo el tiempo y me llego un momento en que de verdad quería saber que era lo que había pasado. Lo que si es que yo me sospechaba al culpable desde mucho antes. Reseña Completa: http://mislibrosyresenas.blogspot.com..."
454,Donna ~ The Romance Cover,"The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins4 stars!!

“Life is not a paragraph, and death is no parenthesis.”

So, I had been on a run of emotional reads and needed something different to brush away those proverbial emotional cobwebs...nothing better than a suspense type read. This is one of those books that gets the old grey matter working as you try and become Sherlock Holmes, reading between the lines and putting two and two together and coming up with five. I have to admit I was pretty useless in trying to work out whodunit in this one, although I did work it out before it was revealed, but not long before.

“One for sorrow, two for joy, three for a girl, four for a boy, five for silver, six for gold, seven for a secret never to be told. I’ve got a few of those.”

This is a book where I found it hard to like any of the characters, which actually amazes me considering I could not put the book down. I was sympathetic towards Rachel at times, but even her I wanted to throttle at various points. So how can a book full of characters that you hate be so all-consuming? This is the genius part, the plot was unique, the writing suspenseful and addictive and not one character in this book turns out who/what you perceive them to be.

“The holes in your life are permanent. You have to grow around them, like tree roots around concrete; you mould yourself through the gaps.”

This book was like a charade party, at the beginning you knew who everyone was pretending to be and then when they took of their mask, bam, totally somebody else...you get my drift? Everyone in this book wears a mask, whether it be for good or evil. Who to trust? Who to believe? 

“Nobody warned me it would break us. But it did. Or rather, it broke me, and then I broke us.”

We have all had that daily, monotonous commute whereby you sit down on the train and look aimlessly out the window as the scenery passes you by, the same shit, different day scenario. Rachel’s train stops at the same stop light every day and this stop light is right outside a little row of houses and Rachel has dreamt up who lives there, what they do, where they work etc. She has created this little fictional village in her head to pass the time. One day she sees something away from the norm, she knows she shouldn’t have seen it, but it just adds a bit more spice to the little story that she has going on in her head. When the woman later turns up missing is what Rachel saw pertinent to the investigation?

“I want to drag knives over my skin, just to feel something other than shame, but I'm not even brave enough for that”

I have to say, I did start out listening to this one but found that I had to jump back to actually reading it because the switches in POV and timeline jumps got really confusing at times when you are playing it by ear. This is a book that is continually moving, hurtling you around in the process, especially your brain as you struggle to keep a mental note of all the who, what’s, where’s and why’s. Rachel has had a tough few years, she has just lost her job, just got divorced from her husband who left her for another woman and she walks around in a permanent state of drunkenness...she is a wallower. She wallows in self-pity for the majority of this book but finally when she is sober you begin to see the real Rachel underneath. The trouble with being a drunk is you become an unreliable witness and when her past and present begin to collide the mess only gets messier.

“I felt isolated in my misery. I became lonely, so I drank a bit, and then a bit more, and then I became lonelier, because no one likes being around a drunk. I lost and I drank and I drank and I lost.”

For a debut novel this was a fantastic read, Paula Hawkins truly delivered a book that confused, befuddled and totally messed with your mind. With many a red herring thrown in to throw you off the scent you will find yourself constantly second guessing everything you read. It was like Cluedo...it was Mr Black, in the drawing room with a rope...oh no it was Mrs Red, in the garden with a hammer, oh no it wasn’t it was...and it goes on...and on...until finally EUREKA!!

“They’re what I lost, they’re everything I want to be.”

If you love suspense then this is a great read and if you can get past some irritating characters that make stupid choices then you will definitely love it. I can’t wait to see what else Paula Hawkins pens, because if this is anything to go by she has an extremely bright future ahead of her.www.theromancecover.com"
455,Rasheem Johnson,"A very juicy book that reads more like a screenplay than a novel. This book was written for the screen. A great mystery compelling characters, a twist, and an ending that leaves absolutely no loose ends (some people may find this annoying). Oh, and Emily Blunt is #notmyrachel. Do better Hollywood "
456,Haley Nguyen,"Told by three very unreliable narrators in limited omniscient first-person points of view, ""The Girl on the Train"" is just so fascinating and full of intrigues that once starting it, one just has to go all the way to the end. Now I get why this book has been staying a best-selling for so long. What a convoluted page-turner it turns out to be! Seriously, it's the kind of book that can't be put down mid-way.I did get a lot of things right though, particularly the answers to ""who did it"" and ""what went down"". *Feeling like a detective, and so very mentally-exhausted as well* =))) ""Everything is not just what it seems."""
457,NinaReader,"4.5 Thrilling Stars!!! ***audiobook***spoiler freeThe audio production~Three very distinct English narrators gives us a compelling insight into the lives of Rachel, Megan, and Anna. The audio narrations were amazing. The 3 different voices allowed for a smoother transition between the different characters as oppose to just allowing one narrator to read the whole book with prefacing it with just a verbal naming of who's POV is being read. The story~Told in 3 different POVs, this thriller weaves the tale of how all three women's lives are somehow connected. It starts with Rachel seeing something while riding the train. That starts the domino of events that intertwine the stories of Rachel, Megan, and Anna. The storytelling is phenomenal, allowing us readers into the psyche of these women before the event (keeping this spoiler free) and after. It messes with your sympathy and dislike for the characters and when you think you are going down one pathway of feelings and thoughts, it diverts you to another. I constantly had to keep changing my theories of how I think this story would end. A great thriller! "
458,Nerfzilla,"Enormously entertaining. This tale, told by the most unreliable of narrators is chock full of interesting and wonderfully drawn characters, a tremendous and propulsive story and an endearing and compelling alcoholic protagonist. The story is interesting and entirely credible. The writing seamless and crystalline and the characters motives relatable (at least to me). This book is very difficult to put down and it at no point disappoints. I can hardly wait for what she writes next. This is an author to be reckoned with."
459,Vani Vani,"I might be the last one to review this book, but then, this book came out around the same time as my book, and I just couldn't get to it. The book is Paula Hawkins's debut thriller and I haven't read her previous novels, but I can definitely say: she has arrived. The book is definitely super-engaging and sort of unputdownable. And no, it's not like Gone Girl, though, the style of writing maybe a bit similar. Gone Girl was different. This is different. For starters, Gone Girl was about one conceited troubled woman, this is about three, if you know what I mean;) The story revolves around the life of three women, like I just mentioned, at least one of them pretty miserable in her life and a maniac depressive of sorts. This is Rachel, who in a way is the main protagonist of the story because it's her voice we read 60% of the time. She drinks and has frequent spells of complete 'black-outs'. That aside, she is pretty exhausting at times and yet she is somebody you could totally relate to. I have made those same train journeys that she emphatically talks about and the way she describes all the people she sees, it's almost like: That's Me, I Saw Those Very Same People From The Train All The Time. The narration then progresses on to focus on the lives of two other women: Anna is married to Rachel's ex-husband, and Megan is another crazy woman, by all means a 'psycho bitch'. The characters are all really flawed , unreliable, and full of conceit. Imagine what would happen if somehow destiny was to bring them all close together, like intertwine their lives, and leave them to resolve it, huh? If I say anything more, I will be giving out the story and I don't want to do that. I just want to say that I loved reading this novel and truly wish to see a movie adaptation of it very soon. The writing is mature and quite in keeping with the requirements of the genre. Overall, a splendid clap-worthy praise-worthy debut!"
460,Elena,"Spoiler alert!!!! I approached this book somewhat differently. I expected to hate everybody in it, because that was the top complaint from my fellow readers. I did not care for the characters, but I did see that at least Megan and Rachel had some background as to why they should behave the way they did. It was not too surprising that Megan was a little out of her mind considering what happened with the baby, and what happened with her brother. For Rachel, I could also see that not being able to have a baby have a could throw someone over the edge. Of course, there are more productive ways to deal with that situation, but then there would've been no thriller. I figured out who the killer was somewhat early, I was interested to see how it's all going to transpire in the end. Rachel is clearly off her rocker, I can't believe it took me long to figure out who she was riding the train every day to spy on her old house and life. I gave the book four stars because it kept me turning the pages and I'm so curious to see what would happen. The last sentence really super creeped me out. As far as the Gone Girl comparisons, it definitely felt very similar. But it was pretty similar in that at the end of Gone Girl, I hated the two of them too. I just didn't hit them throughout the entire book. Also, kind of oddly Anna and Tom reminded me a little bit of the characters Lamb to the Slaughter. The short story by Roald Dahl."
461,angie♡,"This book really messed with my mind. I kind of had a feeling that certain things were going to happen, but with an unreliable main character, it was hard to figure out. Loved it."
462,Lisa Underwood,"I can see why everyone compares it to Gone Girl. If you liked Gone Girl, you'll probably like The Girl on the Train. If you hated Gone Girl, still give this one a try.Rachel is a complex character. She is kind of like a good friend who makes some really bad choices - I wanted to smack her and tell her to get it together, but I couldn't ever hate her. The premise is intriguing - seeing the same people every day when riding the train. It almost feels like you know them... However, the plot ends up being very predictable. Although I knew early on how the book would end, I enjoyed the ride getting there. Very quick read - took me one morning to finish it (in between loads of laundry). While not an earth-shattering read for me, I'll pick up Hawkins's next book."
463,Emlyn Chand,"What can I say I'm really on a women's thrillers kick as of late. Holy wow, were none of the characters in this likable! Still, I did become attached to our primary protagonist, an unemployed alcoholic peeping Tom. The twist was not a surprise. You kind of figure it out given who the narrators are and how few characters are introduced, but still I was sucked in. Very well written and great characterization. I enjoyed it!"
464,N. Ray,"The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five is my preference for less language. The book in its entirety was a great, intense read. I found it hard to put it down and when I did, I found myself pondering the possible future outcomes; You cant get the book out of your head. It's a roller-coaster ride from the very beginning to the end. Did not disappoint. "
465,Jean,I almost didn't finish this book as I found the characters so unlikeable they were irritating. I'm glad I persevered! The narrative is driven by each chapter belonging to an individual character and written in the first person.The storyline is excellent original and fast paced. A real who done it until almost the last chapter. 
466,Allison Boyer,"I liked the beginning a lot, the set up of characters. I liked the continuous guessing of what happened, I kept changing my mind a lot which is fun. I didn't like the evil twirling mustache monolog of the killer at the end. Great book though."
467,Lethea,"Megan, Rachel and Anna will forever be bonded. Rachel was first married to Tom but he left her due to her drinking; had an affair with Anna and married her. While married to Anna, he has an affair with Megan (she's married to Scott). She gets pregnant and threatens to tell Anna which makes Tom kill her. Rachel whose become a severe alcoholic, has suppressed memories of the night Megan disappeared but it's foggy due to her inebriated state on a normal basis. By the time she figures out what truly happened, she's on her way to save Anna and what happens next is what the book is all about; mis-perceptions. I was confused at first in the way the author kept bringing each woman's storyline into the book but it was well written and showed each woman's point of view."
468,Dtminh Doan,"Kết cấu trinh thám của truyện không có vẻ ấn tượng lắm. Nhưng cảm xúc của nhân vật chính quả là ám ảnh mạnh, mà cũng thật gần để hiểu... Tóm lại, vì theo quảng cáo phim & xếp hạng truyện trên truyền thông lôi kéo thì mua quyển này cũng không uổng !!!"
469,Toni,Book had me hooked. I read this very fast on vacation one afternoon. I needed to know what happened. 
470,Jenny Kim,"I'm giving this book 3.5 Stars. Alot of readers compare this book to Gone Girl and I see the similarities, especially in the tone but I believe this book is not in the same standard. If I'm using Gone Girl as the measuring stick for this book then my review is as follows: 1) Gone Girl had a unexpected, smart twist in the mid point but The Girl on the Train was not as successful in the twist. I did guess it. 2) Gone Girl's ending is one of my favourites, the open-ended, unsatisfactory, the no nicely packaged, the-bad-guy gets justice happy ending. This book was the opposite. 3) The quality of writing of Gone Girl was better 4) Like Gone Girl I didn't like any of the characters in the book. I know I will never re-read Gone Girl or The Girl on the Train. I want to like my fictional characters. 5) A page turner read so I expect anyone who picks up the book to have a good time"
471,Kimmy,"(From www.pingwings.ca)Cover image and summary from Goodreads:A debut psychological thriller that will forever change the way you look at other people’s lives.Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning. Every day she rattles down the track, flashes past a stretch of cozy suburban homes, and stops at the signal that allows her to daily watch the same couple breakfasting on their deck. She’s even started to feel like she knows them. “Jess and Jason,” she calls them. Their life—as she sees it—is perfect. Not unlike the life she recently lost.And then she sees something shocking. It’s only a minute until the train moves on, but it’s enough. Now everything’s changed. Unable to keep it to herself, Rachel offers what she knows to the police, and becomes inextricably entwined in what happens next, as well as in the lives of everyone involved. Has she done more harm than good?A compulsively readable, emotionally immersive, Hitchcockian thriller that draws comparisons to Gone Girl, The Silent Wife, or Before I Go to Sleep, this is an electrifying debut embraced by readers across markets and categories.VERY MINOR SPOILERSThis book had so much buzz and I ended up preordering a copy for myself and for my mom. She read the book in a single sitting, which I took as a really good sign! Then I ended up reading the whole book in one sitting! Once I started, I knew I couldn’t put it down until I’d read the entire thing.Part of the buzz I kept hearing about The Girl on the Train was calling it the next Gone Girl. Now, Gone Girl is one of my favourite books, and I am a total sucker for any book that gets compared to it. Even though I feel like those kinds of comparisons are more of a marketing tool, and are not very accurate, I still find myself drawn in. Anyway, all that is to say that this is not, to me, ‘the next Gone Girl‘, but I can perhaps see why it’s being marketed as such.There are three different narrators in this book, and I enjoyed how different their voices were from each other. They definitely felt like distinct voices, which isn’t always the case for me when reading a book with multiple narrators.Rachel, who I think of as the ‘main’ narrator, was a really interesting character, and due to her alcohol-induced blackouts, not the most reliable narrator. I LOVE the use of an unreliable narrator, because it keeps me on my toes, paying more attention to the story and details than I otherwise might. At the same time, since I knew going in that this book employed the unreliable narrator, I wonder if maybe I was paying more attention because I was looking for things to make me distrust or not believe Rachel.Rachel was someone I kind of pitied at the beginning of the story. Her life was a mess, and she kept doing things that I wanted to yell at her not to do. But over the course of the story, as Megan’s disappearance stretched on, it seemed that Rachel found some sort of purpose that made her want to stay sober, and I liked her so much by the end of the book. Details of Rachel’s life – and Megan’s – are revealed over the course of the book, and by the end, I felt like I knew them and understood why they made some of the choices they did.I loved the way the mystery unraveled, because basically all of my suspicions were addressed throughout the book in some way. And even though I ‘solved’ the mystery early on, I wound up second-guessing myself right up until the end. But figuring out ‘whodunnit’ doesn’t mean the mystery wasn’t well done! This book was tense, suspenseful, twisty, and really satisfying.Definitely recommended!"
472,Cenhner Scott,"Primero lo primero: no se crean las comparaciones con ""Gone Girl"". Quizás lo que tengan en común es el formato: en ambos libros cada capítulo tiene un narrador distinto. Y hasta ahí llegamos. No empecemos a decir que todos los libros con un twist son ""Gone Girl"" porque entonces ""Sexto sentido"" es ""Gone Girl"" con muertos, y tampoco la boludez.El libro es un muy buen policial, sin policías. Hay una desaparición y el lector juega a adivinar qué pasó en realidad. Eso está bárbaro; cuando uno lee a Agatha Christie lo que quiere es descubrir al asesino antes que te lo diga la autora, no es cierto? Y si no ocurre, entonces el libro está bien. Bueno, la verdad es que uno más o menos se imagina cómo termina todo. Pero Hawkins se las arregla bien para que no sea evidente y te hace dudar de cada hipótesis que se te va ocurriendo. Incluso de las que resultan ser ciertas.Sin embargo, hay dos cosas en las que falla (y que ""Gone Girl"" lo hace maravillosamente). Primero, las tres narradoras de la historia hablan exactamente igual. Hasta tienen los mismos modismos los tres (las tres ""suben al piso de arriba"", como si pudieran subir al piso de abajo, aunque culpo a la traducción por eso). Te das cuenta cuál de las tres habla porque las tres tienen una historia personal distinta y las referencias cambian, pero cómo hablan es idéntico en las tres. Y el otro punto flaco es que no me generaron ni un pito de empatía ninguna de las tres. Hay un personaje, Scott, que me parecía el más interesante de todos, pero las tres minas no me generaban nada. Al menos a la mina de ""Gone Girl"" la puteé en todos los idiomas.Cuando hagan la película, espero que Dylan Bruce haga de Scott. Toda la novela me lo imaginé como él."
473,Bibek Thapa,"I did enjoy the journey that was reading this book. While it was not as amazing as Gone Girl, which the book is constantly compared to, I still enjoyed it. Can't wait to read what the author comes up with next. :)"
474,Erik O'Brien,Bitches be crazy. Men are pigs. A story best read by Gaslight.
475,Roisin,I really enjoyed this book for the most part but the ending let it down a bit! I would definitely recommend reading it though.
476,Barbi Smith,"Similar to Gone, Girl, except I liked the book rather than hating it. The characters are complex and the story is well-woven. I had a hard time putting it down."
477,Michelle Gilbert,"Great read! Hooks you from the start, thought the ending could have been a little more climatic, but overall great author."
478,Lightblue,"Something bad happenedSi parla moltissimo di questo libro ultimamente e, dopo aver letto che lo si può paragonare a Gone Girl, ho capito che dovevo leggero.E' un buon thriller, in cui si alternano i punti di vista di tre donne diversissime tra loro, chi dirà la verità? Rachel che ogni giorno osserva la vita degli altri attraverso il finestrino di un treno ma che si consola con l'alcol? Anna che ha ""rubato"" il marito a Rachel? O Megan che scappa dal suo passato? Intrigante e coinvolgente, non un capolavoro e non all'altezza di Gone Girl, ma indubbiamente ti mette la smania di sapere come andrà a finire, tanto da non riuscire a poggiarlo sul comodino."
479,Anima Miejska,"Not a totally new concept, but kept me interested, the plot turned out to be gripping, the story skilfully delivered (I really liked the train-like rhythm of the narration), and the ending not that predictable. Highly recommended for those seeking not online a good thriller, but also some sociological and psychological depth."
480,Rebecca Bradley,"There has been a lot of hype about this book and I usually tend to stay away from books where there is this much hype. I know that I can be influenced one way or another. Generally in the negative towards a book. Don’t ask me why, it’s just something that happens. Or I believe it happens…As well as the hype, (mostly on Twitter) I’ve read a couple of reviews of the book and it seems to be a bit of a Marmite book because the protagonist isn’t all sweetness and light. She has her flaws and this doesn’t seem to be something readers are used to.Anyway, this was the third book I read on holiday. Rachel our protagonist is recovering from a divorce and has a problem with alcohol. She likes to look out of the train window on her daily commute and particularly at a certain house. She sees a couple living there; they are often on the veranda area of their home. Rachel has made up names for the couple and by the affection they show each other she has also written their lives out – in her head. This seems to be a form of vicarious living on Rachel’s part.I see that Rachel has a problem with alcohol, but it doesn’t make me want to stop reading. I’m not irritated by her. I like Hawkins style of writing. It’s clean, uncluttered and factual (for the fictional needs).The story really starts when Rachel sees something she’s not expecting to see on that veranda, something that shocks her. It’s not enough that we as readers know the whole story, but it’s enough for Rachel to want to do the right thing, but because of her troubled life this isn’t easy. The story follows her trying to do what she thinks will help but often ends up not doing much to help at all and causing more harm to her fragile self-esteem which exacerbates the drinking cycle.We also have chapters from the viewpoint of other important characters in the story, mixed in with Rachel’s. We have chapters from Megan, the missing woman, from before and leading up to her going missing, and we have chapters from the viewpoint of Rachel’s ex-husband’s new wife, who is not amused by the drunken ex-wife still in their lives.So, I’m sitting in the middle ground area, I’m not raving about it or hating it, but I will say it’s a really enjoyable crime read and I did want to keep picking it back up to see what happened next. I enjoyed it. I think flawed protagonists are great. Hard work for an author to work with because you need to keep the reader interested but I personally love them. (Note my recent penchant for serial killer novels!) The pace of this book was wonderful. I love alternating chapters, they really work for me and I liked that Rachel wasn’t a do-gooder on a train who wanted to solve the crime like a member of the Scooby Doo gang!With thanks to the author, publisher and NetGalley for my copy."
481,Eadie,I enjoyed listening to the audio of this book and found it very intriguing. It had a great plot and believable characters. It is told by different perspectives from the different characters and is hard to figure out exactly what is actually happening until the very end. It held my interest throughout and I actually liked it better than Gone Girl. 
482,Josh,"Now I see what all the fuss is about. This is a tale of human tragedy with a title character (Rachel Watson) who seeks both solitude and attention, her life ruined by circumstance and smashed dreams. She is an alcoholic who is completely broken and living as a ghost in her new life, pining for the old one. In short, she herself is a trainwreck. She fantasizes on her commute to the city, about the lives of strangers she sees, and that, with her booze, is her escape from reality. What she witnesses on her commute one day from the window of the train pulls her into the lives of others who she may be able to help when a horrible tragedy occurs. But is she capable and coherent enough to be of any help?This story masterfully plays on the reader's perception of the characters and their perception of each other. It is successful in painting a portrait of human misery, filled with conflict, paranoia, jealousy and fear. The characters are frail and broken and Rachel among them is what society would consider the weakest, a social liability as it were. This is not entirely untrue and she drives events from her own selfishness and neediness rather than a clear sense of duty. But her actions have a domino effect that open up truths and reveal, for better or worse, what real tragedy lies underneath. A multilayered, nuanced portrayal of human existence is played out here and it shows the depth of deception in both men and women. It shows the frailty, but also the strength of the human spirit and the desire to go good, no matter how misguided. Spoilers 3...2....1....Really, stop reading this and read the book. SPOILERS: What?! Seriously! ......A freaking sociopath! The ending wreaks of deus ex machina, but it's oh so clever in its execution (ha, pun!) I've never met a pathological liar, an alcoholic, or a repeat adulterer. Stay away from this crowd."
483,Deanna,"I enjoyed the book overall. Some parts of the book were a bit dry and dragged, but the ending took me for a total loop! I recommend it. "
484,Abigail,"One of the most gripping thrillers I've ever read. It really messed with my mind and I was jumpy and a bit paranoid. So it was very believeable. At first I was like, um, why is she on the train so much...but then it was Aaaah, who did it? where, how!? "
485,Melissa,"These were not very good characters - you would never want them to be your friends, neighbors, family. That said, I loved reading about them and as much as Rachel would frustrate me, I was still kind of rooting for her to stop drinking and move on.I didn't guess the plot, which always makes me happy, but I could see where others were able to identify the crime a little quicker.And again, I wish Alfred Hitchcock were still alive - he would have done an excellent movie for this book."
486,Sofía Gajardo Vodanović,"Con este libro me ha pasado algo curioso, odie a todos los personajes pero no podia dejar de leerlo. Ni siquiera puedo decir que me desconcertara, ni me sorprendiera mucho, pero si que me volví viciosa con esta lectura, necesitaba terminar de conocer como se desarrollarian los personajes y la historia. Por eso considero que merece las 4 estrellas aunque me desagraden Rachel, Tom, Scott, Anna, Megan y hasta la oficial.... todos los personajes eran deprimentes, enfermos y grises."
487,Marcelle Machado,"The ending was kinda obvious, but the book is so well written, I couldn't stop reading until I finished. "
488,Andrey,"After watching the movie and then reading the book ""Gone Girl,"" I really wanted to get more of the same and somehow ""The Girl on the Train"" seemed like a perfect ""sequel."" And it didn't disappoint. Not to reveal any plot lines, I'll just say that it has some good characters, plot twists and a lot of suspense. This is the type of books that make me fall in love with reading over and over again."
489,Maya,"Awful people doing awful things to themselves and to others.It’s good, very good, really, if you like mysteries with unreliable narrators, tangles of lies, and creepiness. It seems that I do. When I finished, I went back and re-read one of the three PoVs because I knew the author had left many clues there and I just didn’t see them the first time around. Well done! "
490,Tasha,This book reminded me a lot of Gone Girl. It took a minute to get into but couldn't put it down after!
491,Jonah Bateson,"This book is what many would describe as a slow-burner. After all, there are no explosions, set-pieces, or car-chases. When reading the title, I thought it was a wink at being deliberately unassuming and untheatrical, an ironic contrast to the action that lies within.But no, for a good portion of the book, The Girl On The Train literally is about a girl on a train.The train does not derail, it does not get invaded by ninjas, and it is not in fact a time machine disguised as a train. The setting, a London suburb, does not come across as attractive, and to be honest, neither do the characters - in looks or personality.In the first few chapters, you're dying for something to happen - for the main character to have to stand up and let an old person sit down, for the train to get delayed due to leaves on the track, for the train conductor to come and check the tickets...SOMETHING.Many have compared the book to Gone Girl because of its shared 'domestic noir' genre, but in Gone Girl we are hooked in by a missing person story in the opening chapter. The Girl On The Train doesn't even have this.Probably the most exciting part of the first chapter is:""I sliced through the top of my finger while chopping the onions.""But what it lacks in pizazz, The Girl On The Train delivers in character and intrigue. You can't help but be sucked in to the characters' worlds.Hawkins' first thriller is extraordinary in its ordinariness. Strip all of the glamour away, and you are left with characters that feel desperate, broken, and real. Hawkins recognises that it is the characters that make the page turn.Rachel is something of an anti-hero, and I often struggled to get on with her, as does Cathy, her friend (who I feel deserves a bigger part in the mystery). Rachel is selfish, needy, unstable, and nearly always drunk, like the Hunger Games' Haymitch, but without the wit and charm to pull it off.While this makes the novel (which is mostly narrated by her) an often frustrating read, it also makes for the perfect plot device. Because Rachel never knows what's going on, we as readers are also never sure of what's going on. But when Rachel unravels secret after secret, we share in both her shock and disorientation.The book teaches you not to make snap-judgements, because every character is hiding something.It begins with Rachel's fantasised version of characters who she has never met, who she can see through the train window. But even when these characters are introduced and their lives overlap, we're still not sure how to separate the fact from the fiction.The Girl On The Train is a minimalist's dream, and shows how the withholding of secrets and good storytelling can compel and captivate in even the most mundane of set-ups.Yes, I did find it slow to begin with.But, like a train pulling away from a station, I found myself building more and more momentum the further I got, until soon I was unstoppable.Enjoy the dark tunnels, the turns, and the gripping character landscapes - you don't want to miss them."
492,Traci,"First of all, I really wish the comparisons of The Girl on the Train to Gone Girl would stop, as I actually thought this book was better. Other than being a psychological thriller, I didn't really see many similarities between the two. I agree with the statement in a review in The Guardian: ""Hawkins’s Girl is a less flashy, but altogether more solid creation."" I listened to the audio version of the book, and it definitely held my interest, however, I actually think I should have avoided reading most reviews, as some gave away too many plot details. The part of the story line that I most tired of was that of Rachel's drinking - I honestly just wanted to shake her at times and tell her to get on with her life! Obviously, her drinking was central to the plot though, so rather than saying more and risk giving anything away, I would recommend simply reading the book and avoiding reviews! "
493,Tripfiction,"Psychological thriller set in London / The Home Counties (“the village-on-the-edge-of-London”)A hugely hyped thriller, so what is it that makes it so suspenseful?Rachel is a commuter travelling into Euston, London, from the Northwestern Home Counties, who idles away her time on the train into London by peering into the lives of others in the houses abutting the railway lines. And the serried ranks of urban housing certainly feed her fertile imagination, notwithstanding that one of the houses she passes everyday is the house in which she lived with her former husband Tom. He has moved Anna in, and together they now have a daughter, Evie. It is a daily reminder to Rachel of the relationship she has lost. Five houses down from her earlier home, in the very same row on Blenheim Street, she regularly observes a couple interacting in their garden, and she personalises them by inventing names for them, Jess and Jason (in actual fact Megan and Scott Hipwell).But Rachel has alcohol problems, and although she continues the commute into and out of London, she no longer has a job to go to. She was fired for being drunk. But one day she sees Jess being caressed by someone in the garden who isn’t Jason, and shortly thereafter, Jess goes missing. Rachel is desperate to get involved in the search for the missing woman, at last she has a mission, at last she can be of some use to someone – Tom planted the notion with her that she is fat, a drunkard and pretty useless. But because of these alcohol excesses she seems to be a rather unreliable witness and finds herself sidelined by most of the people who are at the centre of this drama. However, the more she is rejected, the more she is driven to insinuate herself into the vagaries of the investigation.It is a gripping read and generally deserving of the fulsome praise. The short sentences and short chapters often feel clipped, which on the one hand can feel limiting, but on the other mirrors the stop/start of a typical commuter train’s progress into a congested London station. The train compartments are hot, they are steamy when it rains, there is little standing room… it is life writ large of the London-bound commuter.But for me the book comes with a proviso. The main female players all essentially come from a similar mould, they are all seem to be (as Anna says of Megan) “absent and self-involved“, and not distinctively fleshed out to really stand out as individuals. They all have the capacity to dissociate from their lives, which then ripples back to the reader, I found it a struggle to really connect with the characters. I am also not overly keen on endings where characters gather together to reflect on what has been going on and then drop the final clues into place to make a cohesive ending.This book comes with a warning if you are going to read it on a train! Enjoy!"
494,Francisca,"Primer libro del año 2016 y vaya que necesitaba una lectura que me atrapara y de esas que no las puedes soltar. Es verdad que las primeras paginas son un poco introductoras lo que lo hace un poco flojito pero a pesar de eso no te da motivos para soltarlo. Una vez que conocí a la protagonista, Rachel, me encantó. Me encantó que fuera tan realista con problemas que podría tener cualquier persona, me encantó que no fuera la típica protagonista perfecta que a menudo se nos presenta en una novela. El libro en si me gustó bastante, el hecho que fuera de misterio me enganchó, la forma en que la autora escribió el genero fue genial y es que tenia todo lo que uno suele esperar y al final siempre en estos casos los escritores les dan ese vuelco que no esperas y nada es como lo prevés, bueno todo eso pasa aquí. También me encantó que nos hablaran del pasado de los personajes y no nos centráramos solo en el presente. Puntos en contra, hay capítulos bastante aburridos y monótonos, algunos son bien parecidos sin muchas variantes lo que por momentos lo hace decaer. También que la primera parte transcurriera todo en el tren me tenia histérica, una vez que cambio de escenarios ya pude engancharme mas. Los personajes en general todos me han gustado. Pero sin duda lo que mas me ha gustado a sido que Rachel estaba tan perdida en este misterio como nosotros y que ni ella supiera que hacer o que fue lo que paso te hacia mezclarte con ella y comenzar juntas a descubrir la resolución. Sin embargo el final no si era lo que esperaba o lo que me hubiese gustado que fuera o como fuera. A pesar de todo me gusto bastante y agradesco que haya sido mi primera lectura de este año. "
495,Robyn Bradley,"I'm thinking this is more of a 3.5, but I rounded up because it definitely was a page turner (I consider this a good thing!). I can understand the comparisons to Gone Girl, but for me, the characters weren't as distinctive in this novel as they were in Gone Girl. The voices of the three main characters sounded a lot alike...a little more variation in speech, delivery, etc. might have helped make them sound a bit more distinctive. That said, I do think this is a strong debut, and I look forward to what this author brings into the world next."
496,Nolan,"This book has enjoyed much success since its publication. Any time a book gets that much hype, I have some concern about whether any book can measure up to the expectations of a hype. This one actually does.Rachel once had a life that offered all the advantages. She had the good marriage, a decent job, and she was very much in control of her life. But that was the Rachel who existed before this book opens. The Rachel we meet is a woman who is jobless but who pretends to go to work each day on the train. She's living off what's left of a savings account and living on booze and very little else. She drinks to the point at which she has blackouts and can't remember significant pieces of her life. It is the alcohol that makes her completely unreliable, and the author writes the character such that her unreliability leaves the reader guessing.While commuting on the train, she travels through the neigrhood where she and her former husband lived. He still lives there with his new wife, and when Rachel is particularly boozed up, she frequently makes contact with him. The train always stops briefly in front of a house near where she once lived, and Rachel gets glimpses of the couple who live there. Based on those glimpses, she makes up names and lives for the couple. She romanticizes their lives, and one day she is shocked when she sees the woman kissing someone else. Within days of the elicit kiss, the woman goes missing, and Rachel has vague memories of what happened, but they won't surface.This is a book about obsession and lies. It is excellently narrated by three narrators who take the points of view of each of three women--Rachel, Megan, and Anna, the current wife of Rachel's former husband.This is a twisty tangled swooping diving plot that is highly readable. I certainly didn't expect the ending, and I finished it the same day I began it."
497,holly,"Really quick page turner. A good psychological thriller that will appeal to a mass market. If you like to be part of the conversation read this, I think everyone else is or will be too. "
498,Tracy,"Better than Gone Girl. At least kept me unsure for a good portion of the book, although it became a little ""hoping for a screenplay""-esque towards the end."
499,Andrea,"Rachel, still raw after her divorce, travels past her former home twice a day on the commuter train. She becomes interested in an ideal couple living in a house a few doors down from where she used to live, concocting an idyllic life for the two. Then the wife disappears, and Rachel finds herself obsessed with the mystery -- where has she gone? What has happened? Can she help the grieving husband find answers and deflect suspicion away from him? Convinced she has seen things from the train that give her extra insight into the couple, she inserts herself into the investigation. Meanwhile Anna, Rachel's ex-husband's new wife, contributes to the narrative, giving us a different view of Rachel and her motives, and making no bones about the fact that she views Rachel's intervention as an attempt to stalk her family. In chapters alternating between Anna, Rachel, and Megan, the woman who has disappeared from her perfect life, the book gives us 3 different points of view of the story -- none of which prepares us for the book's shocking finale."
500,Amanda Austin,"This one started slow for me. It sort of made me ""sad"" because none of the characters are all that likable. I kept going and it did get better. It feels redundant at times, but perhaps that's the point (routine and memory and what it does to us). I felt weird at the end -- maybe as a result of reading too much chick lit that ends on a happy note. If you like mysteries and compelling storytelling, this is a great book. it isn't a light read by any means, but it draws you in. I'm glad I stuck with it."
501,Karen Sage,Twisted bizarre crazy good read but difficult to follow characters and keep them straight
502,Barbara Valotto,"Un bel giallo, ben scritto e ben costruito. Un po' prevedibile sul finale e forse con una serie di protagonisti dalle ""improbabili"" vicissitudini, tutti radunati nella stessa strada. "
503,Tereeeza,"Na Dívku ve vlaku jsem byla hodně zvědavá, reklama byla obrovská. Nemám ráda přirovnávání, tady se neustále mluvilo o nové Zmizelé, od které jsem ve výsledku taky měla obrovská očekávání a Temné kouty se mi nakonec od autorky líbily nejvíc.Dívka ve vlaku nabízí taky pohledy z několika úhlů v poměrně velkém časovém rozmezí. Střídání vypravěčů mám dost ráda, takže tohle u mě určitě zabodovalo. Dlouhou dobu nevíte, jaké bude rozuzlení, ale od určitého okamžiku už si dokážete dost dobře domýšlet a tušit, jakým směrem to půjde, takže u mě nedošlo k úplnému zhltnutí konce, protože to pro mě bylo už jen dovysvětlení a ne šokování a myslím, že to tak bude mít většina lidí. Motiv vlaku, sledování, fantazírování a samotná čtivost je ale určitě plusem. Příběh se však nevyhne jistým klišé, popř. témat a motivů pro tyto knihy tak typické, které nic nového nepřinesou.Jako celek hodnotím slabšími 4 hvězdičkami, ale jsem ráda, že jsem si to přečetla. "
504,Ashely Clark,Come on ride the train & ride it! Such a good mystery. I probably would have finished it in a couple of days if I had not been sick. I recommend this page turner! 
505,Cathy,"Well done! I did get a little tired of Rachel's whining, but I couldn't decide who'd ""done it"" until the end."
506,Robert Parker,"""Rear Window"" meets ""Gone Girl"" in a really interesting who dunnit. I loved the intricate web of connections and trying to figure out who committed the crime. My only complaint is that I have trouble abiding by a main character that can't get on with life because they can't stop drinking. Argh! I felt like launching my own intervention."
507,Tina Siegel,"I adored this book. Maybe it's because I haven't read a lot of crime fiction lately, and I miss it. Perhaps it's my deep and abiding love for English murder mysteries. Or maybe I was just in the mood for exactly this book. Whatever the reason, I devoured Paula Hawkins' 'The Girl on the Train' in a few days. First thing you need to know: it takes Hawkins a while to hit her stride. The first quarter of the book is a little slow and disjointed, mostly because of the plot structure. Hawkins moves between Rachel and Megan's points of view and, in the beginning, there's no real link between the two women. I found myself entertained, but less than engaged (and occasionally bored), by the beginning.Then, Hawkins brings the narrative threads together and adds another (Anna, specifically). Suddenly, there's a purpose and direction to the story that coalesces into a gathering dread as Rachel - and we - slowly come to understand the truth. Now, none of the characters are particularly likeable. Rachel is pathetic, but that's as close as it gets. Megan is a charming, selfish adolescent, and Anna is conventional and boring. Yet we want to know what happens to them. We want them to be okay. That's a testament to Hawkins' talent. She never shies away from her characters' flaws - in fact, she inflates them - but she doesn't define them by their flaws, either. They are fully-realized people. The shifting perspectives also allow us to experience what each character experiences. We're more sympathetic than perhaps we should be because we see through their eyes. My only complaint, really, is that the voices are too similar. Hawkins does a respectable job of differentiating tone and texture, but she could have done more. Clearer linguistics quirks, patterns of speech, cadences, would have been appreciated.Overall, though, 'The Girl on the Train' is a very satisfying read. Fans of crime fiction, and particularly English murder mysteries, are in for a treat. "
508,Jess,I really liked this book! I read it over two days and it really kept me guessing. 
509,Michael Livingston,"A well constructed thriller, combining unreliable narrators, a complicated series of jumps through time and perspective and a slightly too obvious twist. Immensely readable and hard to put down."
510,Joseph-Daniel Peter Paul Abondius,"What a wonderful ,moving grip taking story that pulls you in ."
511,Emily,"You know, to be honest, I don't know exactly how I feel about this book. Was it good? Yes. Did it become slightly predictable? Yes. I struggled with the protagonist's persistent self-pity and immaturity. I kept thinking about those horror movies when you yell at the girl ""don't go in there!"" and she does anyway. But, I guess all of that was 100% necessary to make the plot successful. So, like I said... In not sure how I feel about this one. I can, however, understand the popularity after Gone Girl."
512,Martine Konings,"Het boek mag dan een hype zijn dit moment, en hier komt nog eens een cliché: het leest als een trein. In twee dagen had ik het uit. Vakantielectuur, spannend, behoorlijk uitgewerkte personages, al is de plot niet bijster origineel. Goed geschreven, dus toch vier sterren. "
513,Jagmohan Bhanver,"This is what i call a terrific book. You get drawn into the lives of the characters, and are left wondering whether things are indeed as they seem. Artfully crafted. One feels for the protagonist from the first chapter onward. The book piques your interest. The ending could have been less facile than it is. Except that, it is an eminently good read and connoisseurs of crime/ thrillers would get a bang out of this one. Great job Paula. "
514,Susanchitter,A psychological thriller that is addictive. I could not put it done until I knew what happened. Kept me guessing until the end.
515,Nadia,"Después de haber leído y escuchado tantas críticas (la mayoría no tan buenas) me daba un poco de miedo comenzar con esta historia. Creía que me costaría avanzar y que la lectura me resultaría muy tediosa pero fue todo lo contrario. Me encantó de principio a fin, el progreso que hace la protagonista, no solamente en el asesinato de Megan sino también en su vida es impresionante. Mientras lo leía me iba formando algunas ideas en la cabeza de quien podía ser el asesino pero la autora logró que sospechara de absolutamente todos los personajes. No me sorprendió totalmente cuando supe quien había sido pero me gustó que se haya desarrollado de esa forma.Fue una lectura bastante ligera y atrapante, no podía dejar de leer porque cada página era más y más interesante.Otra cosa que me gustó mucho fue que la historia estuviera narrada desde el punto de vista de tres personajes, eso hizo que no sólo se viera la evolución del personaje de Rachel sino también de la víctima, Megan. Con este personaje me pasó de que cuanto más conocía su historia más pensaba que todo lo que le había pasado se lo había buscado porque de cierta manera no había sido una buena persona, pero el cambio que tiene y que haya terminado como terminó si me llegó a dar bastante lástima. Todos los personajes tuvieron un final acorde a lo que había sucedido anteriormente.Un libro muy recomendable."
516,Sherry,"First read by this author. I can see why they compare it to Gone Girl. I think it was a bit better than gone girl. The 3 ladies, telling the story (which took awhile to get) were interesting. I will definitely be looking for more books by Paula Hawkins. Kept me interested and going back for more."
517,Kayla Small,"I really enjoyed reading this book; however, the character development of the main character didn't seem realistic to me. Though I thought it would, the story didn't challenge me or make me question things. I rated this book a 4 because I never got bored and was forced to turn the page by the gripping details and surprises. It's a good read for a vacation. "
518,Claudia Silk,This is a page turner. I read it in one day because I couldn't put it down. Rachel is an unreliable narrator who rides the same train day after day; she also sees the same people day after day and starts to make up stories about their lives. Then one day she witnesses something and becomes involved in the people's lives she has been fantasizing about for years. This is one you won't want to miss.
519,Bruce Pilkenton,"Very nice whodunit with Hawkins doing an excellent job of spinning and turning and weaving the storytelling through the eyes of a few differentcharacters, so the reader is constantly given new info and constantly being caught off-guard!!....... in my opinion author Hawkins pays wonderful homage to both Hitchcock's STRANGERS ON A TRAIN and REAR WINDOW, beautifully describing what heroine Rachel thinks she is witnessing, and many timesplacing the reader on a commuter train ride that, like the plot, takes unpredictable, tension-filled sharp turns!! Bravo Paula!......"
520,Dan,"This book has been heralded as the new Gone Girl and I can see why. Rachel is a lost soul, a woman who pretends to take the train to work every day so she doesn't have to tell her flatmate she got sacked for being drunk. On the way she goes past her former street, where her ex-husband, Tom, is now living with the woman he cheated on her with, Anna. She also regularly sees a happy couple and imagines their lovely life but things take a turn when he sees the woman, Megan, with another man. Next thing Rachel knows Megan has gone missing and her husband Scott is in the frame for her murder. So it starts pretty much like Gone Girl then. What follows is a narrative from three not-quite mentally stable women, Rachel, Megan and Anna. The police investigation gathers pace and Rachel can't help but get involved, despite the fact the case doesn't really have anything to do with her. Except there's a hint it might. On the night Megan disappeared Rachel was nearby, drunkenly heading to see her ex-husband. But when drinking she often suffers from blackouts and can't remember what happened. It very much has an element of Before I Go to Sleep About It. The best thing about this book is the mystery and the fact it could be any of the characters. Gone Girl is really about whether Nick is responsible or not but this really asks the question of who it could be. I think I suspected every single character of the book at some point and I still wasn't certain who it was even when it was revealed! It has an interesting narrative structure, telling the story from either the morning or evening train journeys. It's a decent idea but I'm not overly convinced it worked, mainly because most of the book is set before or after these times! I enjoyed the book but I couldn't help thinking about Gone Girl the whole time. Yes, it's a different story but I feel like Hawkins meant to write a Gone Girl-type book when she started this. It starts with a missing woman and sees characters looking suspicious about her disappearance. Plus there's a hint of Before I Go to Sleep for good measure (as well as the blackouts there's a character who is a therapist which feels oddly familiar). It has the tension and the great characters of Gone Girl but for me it didn't have the originality that Gone Girl had. It's a writing exercise where the authors starts with the premise of Gone Girl and tells a different story. A good story though and one that will really keep you guessing."

522,Esteban Tomás,Love this book. Amazing. 
523,Shavonne,"worth the read. very twisted and dark characters you really can't feel for and yet you feel for the sadness in them. the book surprised me, not for the dark tone but for the gritty realism of Rachel and her sad life. it was just real and easy to see how someone so lost could get so caught up and confused in the world around her. I don't want to share much about the plot so not to spoil but a good story if you're looking for something to catch you."
524,Tara,"I loved the first three quarters of the book and couldn't wait to pick it up. It's clear why this is the book that everyone is reading. However, I found the ending to be a let down. I honestly felt like I was reading the screen play for a made for TV movie the way the villain explains everything he did and the way the climax all comes together. It just felt a little too contrived after what was a great psychological thriller for most of the book. On the fence between 3.5 and 4 stars. "
525,Angelya (Tea in the Treetops),"Well, after all the hype, it turned out to be just the twisty, turny thriller I hoped it would be. Heartbreaking at times- there are some very messed - up people in this story. Very difficult to put down."
526,Wanda,"Another offering in the rather new genre of Chick Noir (a.k.a. Domestic Noir or Amnesia Thrillers), in which domestic life is no longer the safe place everyone assumes it will be. Unreliable women as narrators are hot right now (think Gone Girl, The Silent Wife, The Devil You Know, as well as The Girl on the Train). Chick Noir is aimed at women (mirroring Chick Lit), but there is no happily-ever-after and husbands are not necessarily people whom women are able to trust.The novel is told from the points of view of 3 women—Rachel (the alcoholic ex-wife), Anna (the irritated current wife), and Megan (the woman-next-door). Along with the differing interpretations of events that you would expect from three different people, we also learn that there is truth to the old saying that those outside a marriage really have no idea what is going on within that marriage—this proves true for all three women.It’s difficult to say anything substantial about the plot without giving away the fun bits, so I will resist the temptation to say too much. This is a 4 star read instead of 5 for me because I guessed the who-dunnit about 2/3 of the way through the book—I really like to be kept guessing! The Girl on the Train (really, couldn’t it have been The Woman on the Train? Rachel is well over 16!) puts the fun in dysfunctional."
527,Yishai,"The whole time I read this book, I was thinking ""this would be so much better if I was stuck on an 8-hour flight."" It's like when we order Big Star tacos at work sometimes for lunch. They're great tacos, but I can't help but think ""these would be so much better if I was drunk and it was nighttime."" I suppose my point is that this book is great for what it is: an airport read, and beyond that, it has little to offer. I'm never going to give it a re-read, I mean. I'd say it's a little long, at a certain point I was like ""okay I get it already! move the story along FFS."" But to Hawkins's credit, I kept on keeping on, and sincerely wanted to know whodunnit. Good airport book."
528,Eleanor,"There is a creeper Girl on the Train who makes it a habit to follow the lives of people she sees from her vantage point on her daily commute, all of whom are just minding their own business in their own homes which are unfortunately situated within viewing distance from the train tracks.

530,Bekah,"This book just totally kicked me in the face! I was in such a reading slump, have been for the last few weeks, but then my library dropped me a message saying this book was in. Thank God! There is nothing quite like a Mystery or Thriller to drag you out of a slump. It was just what I need. Such a fun story, seeing all the different perspectives and timelines, trying as I always do to figure it out before the end, loving the game. All the little twists and reveals along the way were wonderful. I stayed up all night to finish it and I don't regret a single minute!"
531,Georgette,"4.5 stars! What a great mystery! I understand that a lot of people are disappointed that it was compared to Gone Girl but ended up not being like it. Shouldn't that be a good thing? I don't want to read the same story twice.Paula Hawkins did a nice job leading the reader down several different thought trails in this book, the writing was spot on and the way the story unfolded was excellent. It is the type of book that makes you want to pick up more mysteries and get your detective on.Read it before the movie comes out, y'all! "
532,The Reviewers,"Reviewed by Helen Goltz for The Reviewers This was an entertaining read with enough twists and turns to engage the reader. I wish I had read the book before the hype so I could judge it on its merits and not be influenced by its accolades. For me, it doesn’t live up to the hype—it’s no Gone Girl—but that’s not to say I didn’t enjoy it.I wonder how big an impact the catchy title has attributed to its success—I picked it up expecting it to be in the mould of a ‘Hitchcock’ Rear Window story.The characters are believable, and even though Rachel’s personal decline in health and self-esteem is understandable, I still wanted to grab her by the shoulders and give her a good shake. If you are craving a good character-driven novel with plenty of intrigue, then definitely read The Girl on the Train. Your thoughts?"
533,Juli Bogado,"De inicio a final, pura intriga en este libro. Muy bueno!"
534,Ivy Deluca,"Quickshot ReviewI enjoyed it. Unreliable narrators certainly make it more interesting to figure out what is the truth and it is a fascinating study on a person’s perception of their lives vs other people’s view of them. The prose is solid, there is an excitement to find out what happens, but in the end I didn’t care that much about two cheating hos and a sad, sad drunk. If you’re into thrillers though, I’d recommend it."
535,Kali,"from kalireads.com:Beautiful sunshine, cloudless skies, no one to play with, nothing to do. Living like this, the way I’m living at the moment, is harder in the summer when there is so much daylight, so little cover of darkness, when everyone is out and about, being flagrantly, aggressively happy. It’s exhausting, and it makes you feel bad if you’re not joining in.–The Girl on the Train, Paula Hawkins
That’s Rachel, the main character in Paula Hawkins’ hit thriller The Girl on the Train, lamenting her alcoholism, her early morning drinking habits. She likes to drink on the train on the way into the city, she likes to drink on the way home. This isn’t working well for Rachel–her life, you could say, is in shambles.When the train stops, she peers through the windows at a beautiful home, number fifteen, her favorite. A bit of a peeping tom, or just a harmless fantasist, Rachel gazes upon the beautiful couple within. She admires them, their perfect lives. She glances at the wife on the balcony, the husband getting ready for work.When the woman from number fifteen appears on the news as Meagan, gone missing, Rachel’s fantasist ways kick into action. She inserts herself in the investigation, becoming miraculously, eerily close to Scott, the missing woman’s desperate husband. Rachel’s own troubles, bumps and bruises she can’t remember receiving, evenings lost to drink that she knows didn’t go well, hang heavy over her desire to help. She hopes those blanks don’t somehow coincide with Megan’s disappearance.The Girl on the Train alternates with each of the female characters narrating, Rachel at the center, and Megan and her neighbor, Anna, coming into and out of focus. I found this confusing at the start. I was listening on audiobook, and all the pert names blurred together (Jess, Rachel, Anna, Kathy, Megan). Once I attached a name to a character in the story, I was off and running.Comparisons to Gone Girl are coming hot and heavy, but where Gone Girl is twisty, The Girl on the Train is slow and stabbing, with Rachel desperately flailing to fill in her own blank spaces. The endless fans of Gone Girl will surely enjoy The Girl on the Train. But as this awesome Irish Times article points out, this isn’t just the era of Gillian Flynn. This is an era of women writing women-driven thrillers: Gillian Flynn, Tana French, Megan Abbott, Samantha Hayes. And now, Paula Hawkins."
536,Aditya Jain,"""A tiding of magpies. One for sorrow, two for joy, three for a girl, four for a boy, five for silver, six for gold, seven for a secret never to be told.""I completed the last quarter of this book while I was in a train myself. I finished the book and I sighed. It was past midnight. For a long time after that, I stared at the trees and fields and the glittering houses that rushed past. The wind soothed my face and I found myself wondering what stories unravel in these homes. None as convoluted and unnerving as the one I just read, I suppose.This book is exactly what it says in the blurbs. This changes the way you look at people.Rachel takes the same train everyday. She creates a story about one of the houses which she comes across on the way. That is a way of life for her. She does not have a job. Her marraige has been dissolved. She is a hopeless alcoholic, or hopeless she seems. She sees something someday, and that changes her past, her present, and her future. And of those around her. What follows is an amazing tale of suspense, mystery, and intrigue. A very satisfying psychological thriller. It has all the elements, and in perfect balance. It is a very fine psychological study with messed-up characters. A very pacy read. I loved the character-sketches. One of the finest in a while. The climax was engaging. The comparison to Gone Girl is not baseless. I would have been so disappointed if it was an overrated read. I had to read three-fourths of the book before I figured out THE person. And that is saying something. Go on, read this one, if psychological thrillers are your thing."
537,Ľuboš,"Prvých asi 40 strán trošku slabších, ale potom to začalo byt lepšie až na koniec som to nechcel pustiť z ruky. Ani sa nenazdáte a otáčate poslednú stránku.Rozhodne odporúčam 18 z 20 prstov. Tie dva ostatné sa pridali na stranu rebelov. :) "
538,Tad,"This book was really good, for most of it. I'm sad to report that the ending was a bit of a letdown. I don't know why Hawkins chose to go for the cliche ending but she did and so I left the book feeling slightly disappointed. There's so many other ways that Hawkins could have chosen to take this story. For most of the book, she does a great job of crafting a suspenseful, Hitchcockian thriller. That's why I am so sad that she lost steam at the end. This book has been compared to Gone Girl and I think that's a rather apt comparison. In fact, it felt a little too similar to Gone Girl which makes me wonder if Gillian Flynn should sue. Regardless, this is still a well written thriller with plenty of twists. Just don't expect to be that shocked by the ending. "
539,Sahar,"**4.5 stars** I LOVED THIS. I generally don't read many crime/mystery books (in fact Gone Girl is the only one I've read recently), but I hands down think this is my new favourite genre. I loved how the characters in this novel were just so real and flawed and so IMperfect, that they were perfect. In fact, the repulsion that we feel when we meet the majority of characters in this book, in my opinion, makes them that much more interesting and wholesome. I think personally I related to this book a lot more than other books (like GG), because it was set in England and the characters were so British and therefore more believable (for me, anyway). The story may have seemed a bit drab at times (likeEnglish weather), but it kept me hooked and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The ending was actually a shocker, even though I kinda figured it out before it was made glaringly obvious. I've seen so many negative reviews and 1/2 stars for this but I think people need to chill out and stop saying its a complete gone girl rip off (it has its similarities but ultimately it's completely different), but whatevs. I personally loved it and I defo want to read more books like this."
540,Sarah Foster,"This was a really well written book. The characters, especially Rachel, were written very strong. I would have been content just to hear all of the book from Rachel's perspective, rather than having the narration jump around a bit. My only concern was it felt like the author threw too many curveballs to try to get you to guess who dun it. Although, that could also be because this book was billed as the next Gone Girl, so I was looking for the hook, the catch. And I guessed the ending before it was literally spelt out for me, but I was still satisfied. Any book that keeps you reading when you're in the middle is a winner to me."
541,Katrine,"The back of this book made me think it was a horrorstory or something, but the title made me think was some deep story about a girl. It was kinda both. It is a (psychological?) thriller. You get to follow Rachel who has a pretty sad life and kinda just makes herself the detective of a crime. You also get to read the story of two other women who also suffers in some ways... But i did like that. I did feel the characters were interesting, even though a bit similar. I just liked that besides the mysterycrime, you got a deeper story of the actual people involved. Also i did not figure out who the bad guy was until the end. I had my theories, and i argued with Rachels theories underway. I did not really like that i was set up like a diary, that was clearly not a diary? I just feel like it was little point in the morning/evening parting. I get that it's because of the train rides, but after a while it just gets pointless. She even talks about the day before in the current day, so... And maybe a little cliche dialoge some places. But overall i really liked it. I got worked up at the end... "
542,Suzanne,"""Girl on a Train"" was totally not what I expected it to be, but I really enjoyed reading it. It turned out to be a little along the lines of ""The Rear Window"" with a lot of the same undertones as ""Gone Girl."" Ultimately, it ended up to be about marriages gone wrong, and how lies and deception can lead to the unthinkable. While I didn't find any of the characters to be likable, it was very well-written and engaging, this is a good book if you like reading psychological thrillers or crime novels."
543,Barbara Merrin,"Good suspense storyFun page-turner. Reminiscent of ""Gone Girl"" as many reviewers have noted. Insightful portrayal of the nature of alcoholism and the insidiousness of abusive relationships."
544,George,"Αυτό είναι το πρώτο βιβλίο της Πόλα Χόκινς, το οποίο κυκλοφόρησε σε Αμερική και Αγγλία τον Ιανουάριο του 2015 και ήρθε στην χώρα μας νωρίς-νωρίς, μόλις δυο μήνες αργότερα. Ήδη πρόλαβε να πουλήσει εκατομμύρια αντίτυπα στις χώρες που κυκλοφόρησε, έχει δεκάδες χιλιάδες αξιολογήσεις στο Goodreads και δεν θ'αργήσει να γίνει και ταινία. Η συγγραφέας ανήκει στην νέα γενιά γυναικών συγγραφέων ψυχολογικών θρίλερ και πολλοί την συγκρίνουν με την Τζίλιαν Φλιν. Όχι άδικα...Πρώτα-πρώτα έχουμε να κάνουμε με ένα ψυχολογικό-δραματικό θρίλερ και όχι με αστυνομικό μυθιστόρημα. Μην περιμένετε κυνηγητά, μια ντουζίνα φόνους και τέτοια (βέβαια υπάρχει ένας φόνος!). Όμως... το άτιμο μου φάνηκε τόσο μα τόσο εθιστικό, που δύσκολα το άφηνα από τα χέρια μου. Και να φανταστείτε ότι καταπιάνεται κυρίως με θέματα σχέσεων και μυστικών ανάμεσα στα ζευγάρια και με λάθος αποφάσεις και κινήσεις που μπορεί να οδηγήσουν σε ακραίες καταστάσεις, κάτι που δεν είναι ακριβώς το είδος των ιστοριών που με ξετρελαίνουν. Παρ'όλα αυτά η συγγραφέας κατάφερε να μου κρατήσει το ενδιαφέρον από την αρχή έως το δυνατό φινάλε. Και αυτό χάρη στους ζωντανούς χαρακτήρες, τις μικρές εκπλήξεις και αποκαλύψεις σε καίρια σημεία της πλοκής, την ενδιαφέρουσα αφήγηση και, φυσικά, την πολύ ωραία και στρωτή γραφή.Κύρια πρωταγωνίστρια είναι η Ρέιτσελ, μια αλκοολική που πηγαινοέρχεται με το ίδιο τρένο κάθε μέρα χωρίς συγκεκριμένο προορισμό, προσπαθώντας να ξεπεράσει τον χωρισμό με τον πρώην άντρα της (χωρίς να τα καταφέρνει), ο οποίος παντρεύτηκε άλλη γυναίκα. Σ'ένα σημείο της διαδρομής έχει σταμπάρει ένα σπίτι, στο οποίο ζει ένα ζευγάρι. Τους έχει ονομάσει Τζέισον και Τζες. Έχει φτιάξει μια δική της ιστορία γι'αυτούς. Κοιτάζει το σπίτι από το τρένο καθημερινά. Μια μέρα βλέπει κάτι που θα αλλάξει τα πάντα, που θα την κάνει να γίνει μέρος της ζωής τους. Τα πράγματα θα μπλεχτούν.Δεν μπορώ να πω περισσότερα για την πλοκή, έχουμε να κάνουμε κλασικά με απιστίες μεταξύ ζευγαριών, τις συνέπειες των πράξεων αυτών, διάφορα μυστικά που μπορεί να κρύβουν οι άνθρωποι που αγαπάς και που νόμιζες ότι ήξερες, και πάει λέγοντας. Όλα αυτά, όμως, είναι δοσμένα με έναν ιδιαίτερο τρόπο, ικανό να σε εθίσει στην ιστορία και να θέλεις να την τελειώσεις γρήγορα, χωρίς το μελό που περίμενα. Ενδιαφέρθηκα αρκετά για τα προβλήματα των χαρακτήρων, ο καθένας από τους οποίους μόνο άσπιλος και αμόλυντος δεν ήταν, και μου άρεσε πολύ η γραφή, σίγουρη και άκρως ευκολοδιάβαστη. Αυτά τα ολίγα. Δεν είναι για όλα τα γούστα των αναγνωστών αστυνομικής λογοτεχνίας, όμως πιστεύω ότι οι φαν της Τζίλιαν Φλιν δεν θα περάσουν καθόλου άσχημα, μιας και θα πατήσουν σε γνώριμα μονοπάτια (περίεργες οικογενειακές καταστάσεις, μυστικά κλπ) και θα γνωρίσουν εξίσου ενδιαφέροντες χαρακτήρες. Χάρη σε συγκεκριμένες κριτικές στο Goodreads αγόρασα το βιβλίο και χαίρομαι τελικά που το διάβασα."
545,Kevin,"BlurbA woman commuting to and from her work passes the time making up lives to the people that she sees in the houses lining the railway. During one of those trips she sees something odd, the next day the woman of that house goes missing. Of course she feels she should report this but in doing so it places her into the glaring eyes of the police and in the middle of the investigation.ReviewAt first I was wondered if this book was aimed more to women as it was told from the mind set of three different female perspectives. It took till about halfway before I could really begin to associate myself with the characters but from there the pacing was nicely done and jumping from narrator to narrator only sets up several mini cliffhangers all the way till the satisfying end.I have recommended it to a few friends, first time in a long time, as I feel it would span quite a few different genres. Its a satisfying ending worth sticking around for. I am also looking forward to seeing what they do with the movie, although I will always be glad I read the book first.The Girl on the TrainPaula Hawkins"
546,Rhianne Williams,"Rachel was definitely me at one point in my life, sad and wishing I had another womans life. I still do that sometimes, but Rachel had such a warmness about her even when she was going a little stalkerish about her ex-husband. Needless to say she was a very loveable character. Her story starts on the train into London which stops at a red light at the same time every day, allowing her to glimpse into the lives of the houses opposite. She even goes as far as naming the people she sees there but there is one house she refuses to look at. It flips between the train there, the train back and her walk in through a friends flat. As it starts to move on she sees something that makes her mind whirl. Rachel becomes obsessed with finding out who what where and when, she even gets caught up with the police but one thing I never expected was the horrific, although pleasantly surprising ending. The story really takes off when she wakes up one morning, brushed and bloody with no recollection of anything. Not even how she got home. She then discovers one of the people living in the house a few doors down from her ex-husbands had been murdered on the night she lost her memory. Rachel is unable to keep her obsessive nature from finding out the truth. We meet Rachels ex-husband, Tom's wife Anna and these three women all get entangled together as the sporty goes on, however their ability to get through the terrifying ordeal is remarkable. I have to say the ending to this book took me by surprise it was written so well, and it's definitely worth the read. I'm usually pretty good at guessing the endings to book but this one, blew my mind. I loved it. Also published on redlittleboots.blogspot.co.uk"
547,Diane Coto,"Rachel is disturbed on many levels. She became broken years ago when she realized she couldn’t conceive a baby and become a mother. Instead of seeking psychological help, she turned to the bottle. And like one domino knocking down another, the booze caused her relationship with her husband, Tom, to dissolve. Frustrated by her constant drinking, he turned to Anna. Now he is married to Anna and they have a baby daughter, but Rachel has a difficult time leaving them alone. She still thinks of Tom as her husband. Her drinking also caused her to lose her job. Now, she goes on the train to London every morning as if she is still employed so that her landlady, Cathy, won’t be concerned about the rent.Rachel lives more in her thoughts about other people than in her own life. On the train, she makes up stories about the people in the houses in Corly Wood as the train passes through. In fact, she used to live in one of those houses with Tom. He’s still there with his new family. Five houses down from there, she envisions the life of Jason and Jess. They are so much in love; she can just tell. Then, one Friday, she sees Jess kissing someone other than Jason. The next morning, the woman disappears. From the news, she finds their real names are Scott and Megan Hipwell. On that same morning, Rachel has injuries for which she can’t remember the cause. She has only fragmented memories of Friday evening. She was in Corly Wood.Our protagonist is not a young, beautiful, and near-perfect person. In fact, she’s let herself go. She’s overweight; she wears no makeup; and she practically stays drunk. Most of the chapters are told from Rachel’s perspective, but there are chapters from Megan and Anna’s perspective as well. Everyone has their fair share of secrets and it all comes pleasantly to a surprising ending. I liked the character of Rachel, only because I got to know her through the chapters devoted to her. I can understand why she frustrated so many people. She appeared to be in everybody’s business and wouldn’t seek help for her alcohol abuse. Rating: 4 out of 5."
548,Fernando Castillo,This psychological thriller is full of twist and turns. It will make you want more. Highly recommended. Perfect for a stay home weekend. Great writing by Paula Hawkins!
549,Melissa Lawson,Great mystery. Interesting characters. 
550,Rich,"I don't usually think of novels as page-turners, but ""The Girl on the Train"" is a page-turner of the first rank. It was difficult to put down. The author, Paula Hawkins, uses three female narrators, each deeply flawed, to spin a yarn of unhealthy relationships, self-destructive behavior, deception, and murder. By jumping back and forth between the present and the past, she forces the reader to pay close attention or become lost as events play out. I finished the book about 30 minutes before yesterday's Super Bowl kickoff. I'm glad I didn't have to make a choice between the book and the game."
551,Jane,"This was a good, quick read. The chapters alternate between two characters perspectives throughout much of the book, which makes it interesting to try to piece the story together. The author's depiction of Rachel and her alcoholism is really well done. The way she explains the yearning, shame, guilt and downward spiral of her feelings is great. The story has plenty of twists and turns to keep you guessing and although the story is wrapped up in the end, it definitely keeps you thinking. Highly recommend this book."
552,Jana,"Gone Girl und The Girl on the Train haben beide ""Girl"" im Titel und legen ihren Fokus auf 'komplexe Thrillerfrauen'. Demnach MUSS es ja ein Plagiat sein. Sind schließlich zwei vom Leben gebeutelte Frauen die ein bisschen trinken, einige Tobsuchtanfälle haben und eben alles besitzen, was eine Frau erst komplex macht....Also manchmal könnte ich einigen 40+ Redakteuren die Bücher um die Ohren hauen. Bin jetzt nicht abnormal engagiert für Frauenrechte, aber wieso kann eine Frau denn nur aufregend sein wenn sie ein American Psycho ist?Wer GOOT nämlich mal wirklich gelesen hat, der wird schnell merken, dass unsere Protagonistin Rachel ganz anders ist als Amy. Natürlich ist sie kriminell-verwegen, aber vorallem ihre Verletztheit (ist das überhaupt ein Wort?) macht Rachel zu schaffen.GOOT erzählt, warum Rachel sich von Filmriss zu Filmriss bewegt, warum sie in einem Zug sitzt um ihren Ex + die Neue zu beobachten, warum sie sich zur Dauerlügnerin gewandelt hat und wie das alles mit dem Verschwinden der jungen Megan zu tun hat. Dieses Zug-Stalking entwickelt sich zunehmend zum perfiden Beziehungsterror, und deswegen hat selbstverständlich jemand Tode hinzunehmen. Alles was dazwischen kommt wird halbwegs nüchtern preisgegeben und thematisiert Dinge die eigentlich ganz topaktuell sind. Bei den 3 verschiedenen POVs weiß man ganz ehrlich nicht wie man denken soll. Man fühlt sich generell dauerverarscht, weil so viele im Buch so egoistisch sind und irgendwie nur einen ganz kleinen Horizont haben. Jeder lügt, aber wirklich >jeder<.Dabei ist Rachel zum Beispiel so herzzereißend abgefuckt, dass es schonwieder ... ja, sympathisch ist. Trotz ihrem Versagen und ihrer Unperfektheiten trägt sie ihre eigenen Maßstäbe und Stolz. Es ist wirklich traurig zu lesen, wie sie noch tiefer rutscht und aus Lust und Laune von xy beleidigt wird. Mag sie schräg sein wie sie will, sie tat mir echt leid und ich hoffe ja dass sie's schafft ._.Allein weil ich wissen wollte wie es mit ihr ausgeht hab ich die Story binnen 2 Tagen verschlungen. Schnell hat mans durch, weil Hawkins nicht viel Zeit in ihrer Erzählung verschwendet. Bis zum Ende fiebert der Leser mit, fühlt ALLE Fühle und ist glücklich oder frustriert, weil man am Anfang schon die richtige Vermutung hatte. Wie sagen die Deutschen das immer so eklig? 'Ganz großes Kino' - und hey, das wars auch ohne ein Gone Girl² zu sein.An der Stelle möchte ich nur als einziges Manko kritisieren, dass die Männer vergleichsweise unkomplex waren. Manche Tode muss man wohl sterben :)"
553,Red,"This. Is. Good.This. Is. Great.I mean I can't put this novel down. I keep reading and read, except when the customers came and I just think, ""fast... faster... Thank you so much, now I'll have to go back to my novel.""AH! But why I give this 4 stars? Well it actually 4.5 stars. Cause when it come to the climax, one customers came and sit--SIT and TALKING TO ME!--I mean, I like being accompany but WHY WHEN THAT TIME LIKE THIS!? (like that--when I just want read, finish this, and close the Expo)And before she left, came another customers, and another either...I have to happy, right? That the books sold. But.....Well, after that I have to closing the Expo and some regulation that have done before I closed it. It was 5.30 pm. Time to go home.So I gone home, and wait for some hours (you know, the best time to read and not getting for any interference) and read it just for a half hour--the longest is one hour.So I get the conflict but it became more like anti-climax for me.""Er? He died? Then... a month later?""-------------------Well, just see the blurb itself or synopsis from another goodreaders who more diligent to write the synopsis...-------------------But I finished this in two days! 400 pages.

I already like him, you know, and he not getting any more important role after Anna more trust Riley than G. And I always said, ""stupid Anna,"" ""stupid Megan.""And why you didn't give more explanation for Kamal? And actually I know with who Megan/Jess get 'shared', and who's the murderer. Paula have give you so many hints. So I became, ""Ah, I knew it."" (hide spoiler)] (hide spoiler)] (hide spoiler)]"
554,Nancy Rossman,"Wow, that was quite a ride. Well done mystery, although I maintain that the omniscient POV is not one I like. In thinking through this whole crazy plot, though, there didn't seem to be another effective way to tell the story. I must admit, I had to keep reading, keep reading to find out just what happened that night with Megan. And I certainly didn't come close to figuring it out. At times, I believed anyone could have killed her. Except Kathy. ha.Tight and vivid writing that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Sorry, cliqued. Thx to M. Lynn for the recommendation."
555,Federica,"Recensione completa su On Rainy DaysUn thriller fenomenale dalla prima all’ultima pagina, che conquista nel mettere perennemente in scacco le certezze del lettore.[…]Il thriller di Paula Hawkins sconvolge e intriga per la semplicità del pretesto narrativo, per la sorprendente e disarmante umanità delle tre voci narranti e per la costante fame di sapere che attanaglia leggendo le 308 pagine del romanzo.Dico semplicità per descrivere il fatto che mette in moto e intreccia le vite di Rachel, Megan, Scott, Anna e Tom perché una delle azioni più comuni e semplici per raggiungere Londra dalle città in periferia è usare il treno, ed è proprio attorno alla vecchia linea che passa accanto alle case di Witney che la storia prende forma e si sviluppa, diventando poco a poco sempre più complessa, meno lineare e meno scontata.[…]L’avere tre punti di vista diversi incastrati attorno a una misteriosa scomparsa non fa che mettere in dubbio le certezze che si crede di aver conquistato poche pagine indietro. Ci si rimette in discussione capitolo dopo capitolo e si perde la cognizione del tempo. Volete sapere, dovete assolutamente sapere cosa è accaduto davvero perché leggendo ci si sente un po’ come Rachel: l’immagine è sfocata, sembra quasi un sogno, ma sappiamo di aver intravisto qualcosa; la soluzione è a portata di mano ma non riusciamo ad afferrarla."
556,Laura Adams,"This book manages to create a sinister mood without stating that the characters are ever in any danger (at least until the climax, when the danger is definitely present). It's something about having an incredibly vulnerable yet untrustworthy narrator that makes this quite unique. It's very difficult to like any of the characters, and finishing the book left me feeling quite empty, but it's still an incredibly interesting and well-written book. Maybe don't read before bed-time though. "
557,Amy Nelson,"I ""read"" this on audiobook. My first attempt at listening to fiction. For the longest time I viewed audiobooks with an heir of snobbery that I couldn't possibly enjoy or get into a book by listening. However I have a friend who swears by them so I figured I couldn't decide I didn't like them without even trying. I think that had I tried to read this text, the first part would have been boring and difficult to get through. However I put this on during my long walks and found the narrators voices pulling me into the story. It took much longer to finish than when I physically read book, and by the end I really found myself wanting to put in my earbuds and hear what happened next. I recommend getting the audio version and setting out for a long walk!"
558,Ritika Sowda,"Girl on the train by Paula Hawkins is one of those books you would love to have on your bookshelf. The biggest reason why is that you cannot call yourself a book-nerd if you have not read this one. Now, most authors would want their protagonists to be interesting people with interesting lives. Paula Hawkins, however, went for Rachel, an alcoholic with the most mechanical life you could possibly imagine. What is most ironic here is that this book is a top notch thriller with the first few chapters being quite dull and grey; it successfully creates an illusion of normalcy, of nothing seeming to be out of place. Just when you are being lulled into monotony, you come face to face with the turning point of the plot and suddenly everything becomes ten times more interesting. The reader’s curiosity deepens with every page he turns; he quickly reaches the point where the book becomes “unputdownable”. Explaining the plot would most definitely ruin the read, and hence, I’ve decided to explain the character of Rachel, our Girl on the Train. As mentioned earlier she is not built of the usual protagonist material. A person with some serious flaws, Rachel is a divorcee who has sought refuge in alcohol. She drinks excessively and this costs her, her job. Afraid that her apartment owner would not want to have a jobless tenant, Rachel takes a train to London every day pretending that she goes to work. On one of those routine journeys, she sees something from the carriage window that shatters the monotony of her life. It’s only for a brief moment, not even a paragraph but a mere sentence that forms the turning point in the plot. What is most interesting about the book is the writing style. The reader is compelled to see the picture through the eyes of three different women- Rachel, Anna and Megan, and is compelled to adapt himself to the constantly changing time frame of the plot. Towards the end of the book, the reader is left with random pieces of a puzzle with ABSOLUTELY no idea where each piece fits in the bigger picture. Only when the reader completely finishes the book, can he enjoy the satisfaction of having solved the puzzle. And this is what sets a true thriller apart from the rest. Reading this book is like sitting on a roller coaster ride; you can resume breathing normally only when you finish reading it. By that time, Rachel would have easily gotten herself a place on your “Unforgettable Fictional Characters” list; enough to show that she is more than just a girl on the train."
559,Scribbling-Wren,Just my kind of book. Twists & turns that make you pop life on hold 'til you've finished it. Fab! Do recommend it but not if you've got anything that you actually need to do. 
560,Noa Lehnsherr,"Es una novela que me ha mantenido en tensión en todos y cada uno de sus capítulos. A pesar del inesperado final, creo que le ha faltado algo, quizás debería haber terminado de otra forma, extenderse un poco más, creo que podría haber sido más currado. En mi opinión fue a un final hecho a toda prisa. Aún así lo recomiendo, mucho además, al ser un Thriller que te deja con la boca abierta y con el corazón latiendo a toda prisa. "
561,Ellen Gail,"
""I have never understood how people can blithely disregard the damage they do by following their hearts. Who was it said that following your heart is a good thing? It is pure egotism, a selfishness to conquer all.""
I am a peaceful person. I've never punched anyone. For all my colorful language, I am pretty fucking nice. Rarely angry. I like to think I am a good person.The Girl on the Train is about the worst parts of people. It's a complex, exciting thriller that isn't afraid to showcase the characters in the worst possible light. Also all three of the narrators are woman, wonderfully complex and deeply difficult to like. That's so rare!So, to get to my main point, I liked Rachel. And I fucking hated her.My dad's an alcoholic. My worst fear, worse than snakes and rejection is becoming a lonely, rage-filled alcoholic. I love my dad. He is an amazing person. But I don't want that. I don't like who I am when I drink too much. I don't think Rachel did either. Was Rachel a good person? I don't know. I'm not sure if she knew. I hate her because I don't ever want to be her, but damn if I wasn't rooting for her too.This book has a great plot, stellar pacing, and it was exciting and twisty and everything a good thriller should be. But the characters; they are the kind of characters that leave me wondering if I'm truly a good person deep down in the pit of my innards, or my soul, or where ever.Okay, second point. A happy point! I FIGURED OUT THE ENDING! Y'all, this is monumental for me. I never, ever guess the ending to anything. I don't usually mind. I like surprises. But I also like being right. So, way to go self! You solved the mystery!(Calm down self. You solved a fictional mystery 75% of the way through. It's not the achievement of the century.)So, to the fifty bazillion people who said, ""You like to read right? Have you read The Girl on the Train yet?...Oh, you haven't. Well, can I borrow it when you're done?"" Yes, it was awesome and thanks for suggesting it and no you can't borrow it because last time you borrowed Gone Girl it disappeared for 6 months.Now I'll go back to being irrationally proud of myself for my mystery solving skills and start planning my Nancy Drew Halloween costume."
562,Cristina Lee,"Una storia che è partita confusa su un treno, attraverso un finestrino, ha pian piano preso colore attraverso tre punti di vista di donne apparentemente diverse, ma con in comune più di quanto si possa immaginare: Rachel, Megan, Anna.Ampio spazio narrativo viene dato alla Ragazza del treno, Rachel, che ogni giorno prende lo stesso treno per Londra e si perde attraverso i colori e le sfumature che le appaiono agli occhi sul finestrino, alla stessa poltrona. Fin quando poi il treno non rallenta al semaforo, ed eccola lì la casa perfetta con Jason e Jess, coppia romantica, amorevole, che attraverso carezze e baci le ricordano il suo, di amore. Al passato, vicino. Sempre lì, accanto alla casa che guarda, osserva e in cui si perde, sentendosi meglio un po' alla volta nel vedere i due personaggi fittizi felici. Perché lei felice non lo è più, non dopo che Anna le ha rubato il suo Tom, con cui si è creata la vita che sognava. L'alcool le tiene compagnia costante, allo stesso tempo le toglie ancora una volta tutto ciò che ha: il lavoro, i soldi, una vita, i ricordi.Perfino i suoi Jason e Jess che osserva ogni giorno non si chiamano realmente così, lei nemmeno sa, i loro nomi o i loro impieghi, non li conosce. Ma per lei, sono quello che immagina che siano. Finché un giorno durante la solita routine al finestrino le appare uno scenario diverso. Da lì il tutto cambia.Una corsa contro la verità, così vicina ma poi così lontana. Credere o non credere? Pazzia o realtà? Un assassino che è stato davvero impossibile identificare.Un thriller ben studiato, che sa coinvolgere il lettore, dopo l'attimo di confusione iniziale, per la poca confidenza con i personaggi e la somiglianza nella narrazione seppur con i diversi personaggi, unica pecca a tratti trascurabile. Le ultime pagine sono una corsa, un po' come in treno. Lasciando finalmente vedere chiaramente al lettore i fatti, seppur attraverso un finestrino.Una lettura che consiglio caldamente agli appassionati del genere!"
563,Karona Thompson,"*****MINOR SPOILERS*****Ahhhhhh. That book took my mood from slightly happy to pissed, depressed, annoyed and just dread. BUT....... It was good. 1. The writing was A1. Again, thumbs up for great writing skills. 2. The suspense; I mean I couldn't figure out anything. One moment I swear it was Rach who'd kill Megan. Like fr, fr. 3. I was given a detailed look of the characters lives. How everything - fault, was because of some past experience/disappointment.It was a really good decent read. Plus it really did a number on me. I must say, I will definitely start looking at people much more differently. You just don't know who is who. And what one's been through.My favourite quote: I have never understood how people can blithely disregard the damage they do by following their heart. "
564,Mj,"Paula Hawkins first novel kept my interest and kept me guessing. While it was billed as a thriller, I have read other thrillers that kept me holding my breath more and causing my heartbeat to rise even higher. What this book did accomplish that many primarily plot-driven and plot-focused thrillers do not is to develop well fleshed out characters that invoked a lot of empathy.Hawkins used alcoholism, fantasy, thrill and sex addiction, physical and psychological abuse and the resulting low self-esteem to add much more character depth than is often offered in the usual novel, particularly those of the thriller genre.I had an idea of who was responsible fairly early on, but Hawkin’s story and the options she presented, continued to keep me wondering. Blackouts caused by alcohol binging were used effectively to keep me guessing as did the fantasies and obsessions of a number of principle characters keep opening up all kinds of possibilities and cause even more uncertainties about the who’s, how’s and why’s.The Girl on the Train was well written and engaging, particularly considering this was a debut novel by Paula Hawkins, an author from London, England who was born and raised in Zimbabwe.I had figured out the doer of the evil deed towards the end so I the ending wasn’t totally surprising but it was quite satisfactory. I really enjoyed the combination of strong character development in a plot that offered lots of twists and turns. I think I’d consider it in the psychological fiction genre rather than a thriller due to the strength of the issues brought up and the characters involved in the novel. And that’s a good thing!! 4 stars for me which is a terrific start for a new author that I hope to read more of. "
565,Sera Seah,"Read this awhile back. Surprisingly, I still remember the plot quite well."
566,FloraBookBliss,"*Actual rating 3,5 starsSynopsis:Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning. Every day she rattles down the track, flashes past a stretch of cozy suburban homes, and stops at the signal that allows her to daily watch the same couple breakfasting on their deck. She’s even started to feel like she knows them. “Jess and Jason,” she calls them. Their life—as she sees it—is perfect. Not unlike the life she recently lost.And then she sees something shocking. It’s only a minute until the train moves on, but it’s enough. Now everything’s changed. Unable to keep it to herself, Rachel offers what she knows to the police, and becomes inextricably entwined in what happens next, as well as in the lives of everyone involved. Has she done more harm than good?My ReviewA shocking, fast-paced thriller that can't be missed!The girl on the train follows a young woman called Rachel, every day she takes the same train and observes the same couple, sometimes she even feels like she knows them personally. However one day she sees something shocking and everything is turned upside down.This psychological thriller is different than every book I have read before, most of the time there is at least one person in a book that you like, here this is not the case; every character is absolutely terrible, no one can be trusted. In this case, it actually worked in advantage of the story. Every tiny part of the story was well-plotted, as well as the character development was very well-done.The story worked very addictive, I wasn't able to put it down! However after I read approximately half of the book I started to expect the ending, the ending itself felt a little flat and cut-short in my opinion. Which is too bad because it did disappoint me a little bit after such a great story!All in all, I think the plot is great, original and very addictive. The story itself is amazingly-written; the twists and turns fit exactly. Only the ending didn't fully satisfy me, which doesn't mean that I didn't like it at all, I would love to read more from this author! "
567,chrissy mcfadden,I couldn't put this one down. I will be on the lookout for any book written by Paula Hawkins. There are so many twists and turns that keep you reading well past bedtime!!
568,Nalini Kuruppu,"I enjoyed this book. I am drawn to dark characters so these folks were right up my ally. I think it held together well and the pace of tension building was spot on. I wasn't let down at the end at all and while it was a little over-the-top with personality disorders, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a fun, quick read."
569,Ezgi Su,Ruh halimi tepetaklak ettin kitap! -___- Bunu başaracak kadar güçlü bir kurgusu ve karakterleri olduğu için verdim bu puanı yoksa bilsem yanına yaklaşmam. Ardından bir kaç romans devirdim zaten. İyi geldi.
570,Alyssa,"A good, breezy suspense/thriller kind of book - maybe a little under deserving of the hype it is getting. I didn't have the same strong reaction to the characters that some other readers did, although i think Rachel's drinking was realistically frustrating (""get your shit together girl! you could have figured this out ages ago!"" i wanted to scream in a really uphelpful but true-feeling way).I would recommend it, but not with the same level of passion i would many other books (including 'Gone Girl' which this keeps getting compared to for some reason that is beyond me)"
571,Melyssa,"I recently read an essay extolling the value of reading books featuring unlikeable characters. The writer argued that in fiction, characters shouldn't have to be likable. That essay kept popping into my mind as I read this mystery/thriller because all three of the narrators are challenging flawed people that are nearly impossible to like. I was still engaged in the story, and couldn't wait to see how the story was resolved. This book has been called this year's Gone Girl, which I think is an incorrect comparison that made me expect certain things to happen that did not. The premise -- watching people from the train and imagining lives for them before finding out their realities were much different -- is intriguing. And even though the narrators were hard to like, I found myself wanting better things to happen, at least for two of them.Read for PopSugar reading challenge task 4/Book Riot Challenge task 23: Read a book published this year"
572,Angela (PerpetualPages),"This was really good. I kept hearing it was ""the next Gone Girl"" so I was really intrigued and went into it with pretty high expectations. I can definitely see why people are comparing it to Gone Girl as there were quite a few similarities. One of the biggest differences though, to me, was that Gone Girl was MUCH more twisted. I finished Gone Girl thinking ""how in the world did the author even come up with that story?!"". However, that was not the case with this book. It is a psychological thriller so yes, it was incredibly creepy and mysterious but the twists and the big reveal didn't impress or shock me that much. I think the story itself was great. The writing was wonderful. And the characters were written extremely well. Overall, a really good read and I would definitely recommend it to fans of psychological thrillers such as Gone Girl."
573,Isak Idaho,"So this book is very similar to gone girl in a lot of ways. Normally, that would turn me off to it because i would just feel like I was reading the same things in a different setting. But, I surprised myself by not feeling that way! I did have the moments several times upon reading it of deja vu to the Dunnes, don't get me wrong. But this story really took on a life of its own. I could envision it all so well, and the setting, felt like an awesome eerie black and white movie from the 50's. If gaslight, gone girl and stand by me had a baby, I would name it 'girl on a train'. "
574,Lisa Marie,"*3.5 stars* Though hailed as the next Gone Girl, I can't say that I liked this book as much as Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl. Yes the double lives and psychotic antics of the main characters give you that Gone Girl appeal, I would say this novel is more reminiscent of a Alfred Hitchcock flim. I did enjoy the read, and when I wasn't distracted by life's chores it was very captivating and hard to put down. With Girl on the train there wasn't one character that I liked, I found myself loathing not only the main characters but the secondary characters as well. I am not sure if this was the intention of Paula Hawkins, if it was good job. Girl on the Train is full of plot twits and a who done it mystery with a ending that leaves the reader satisfied just not as satisfied and shocked as Gone Girl. So for that Girl on the Train comes in second to Gone Girl."

576,Alex Johnson,Literally read this in a day. Fast paced and engaging. Would be a great beach read. No one is very likable but it's a good time.
577,Lisa Wilson tarlecky,"I started slow with this book, but ultimately was glued to it and the story revealed itself in a constant swirl. I really enjoyed this book."
578,Lynnski,"Worthy of all the praise it is receiving - consider it a must read! I finished it in 2 days because I never wanted to put it down. This is a GREAT ""who done it"" novel told by 3 different narrators - an alcoholic that has missing and disjointed memories; a woman with a past that haunts her; and the woman who stole the alcoholic's husband. All 3 are dysfunctional in their own way and draw you further into the story. When one goes missing - is it foul play? If so, who is to blame? You will change your opinion multiple times throughout the book. I can't tell you more without giving it away so you'll need to read it and figure it out on your own. Just be ready for a roller-coaster ride when you do. "

581,Hannah Burke,"In my quest for a psychological thriller that could keep me as enthralled as Gone Girl, I stumbled across Girl on the Train. The book didn't fail - I really did struggle to put it down, craving the knowledge of 'what happens next'. I despised almost every character in the book. Not only were they unreliable narrators, they were exaggerated beyond real life, which meant that I did feel at times like I was being swamped in melodrama. My immature imagination raged every time Rachel bought another gin and tonic; my naive mind willing her to stay away from the alcohol. At the time, I thought it was awfully repetitive - this cycle of Rachel's drunken episodes - but then I realised the reality of being an alcoholic - it doesn't just disappear over night. I then appreciated this more realistic approach to a character, rather than a fairy-take-like, magic vanishment of all addiction. I figured out the killer too early on for my liking: I missed that last-gasp, horrifying resolution of Gillian Flynn's trilogy of thrillers. Nonetheless, I cannot award the book any less than 4 stars because it really was a thriller - it gripped me from beginning to end. Despising the characters does not take away from the story: they are not supposed to be likeable. Similarly, working out who was responsible for the murder earlier on than my liking did not ruin my experience of the book - I had to keep reading, waiting for any possible last-minute revelations that would reveal an alternative killer. "
582,Tally,"This was a completely immersive thriller. The interplay of multiple points of view made the story bigger and richer. I dare you to not feel any emotion while reading this. The characters and their issues felt very real, and the way each one related to the story was poignant and heartbreaking.Slowly, new information is leaked to the reader, making for an extremely suspenseful novel. After about the halfway mark, it was like torture having to put this book down. Fast-paced and jarring, this book is sure to grip you from the very start."
583,Lize Lance,This one is a bit of a dark read. I enjoyed jumping between perspectives although I found it hard to keep track of the time line. The last half of the book was really captivating and I could not put it down. 
584,Ariel,"What happens when an alcoholic, drug addict, and psychopath collide? As you can imagine nothing good. This book is already being hailed as the next Gone Girl because it strips away the happy veneer off of seemingly domestic bliss. The thing about Gone Girl was Amy and Nick were such likable people. They both presented so well and you happily bounced back and forth through the story not knowing exactly who to believe. In this book I couldn't stand anybody. The reader is forced to view the events primarily through the muddled, alcoholic thoughts of Rachel. Rachel is truly one of the most pathetic characters I can remember reading about in a long time. She is divorced from her husband Tom and obsessed with his new family. Every day on her train ride she views a couple living in the house a few doors down from her former residence. She imagines a life for them and then one day the woman goes missing. Rachel inserts herself into the investigation and a lot of ugly truths get revealed. I could see which way the plot was going way ahead of the curve but it was a quick read and it kept my interest. Although not as twisty as it's much compared to cousin Gone Girl, this book is still a fun little thriller to kick off the New Year."
585,Anisa Dwi Oktariani,"Sebelum aku membaca buku ini, banyak yang mengatakan bahwa buku ini merupakan gabungan antara Before I Go To Sleep dan Gone Girl. Dan setelah membacanya sendiri, aku setuju dengan pendapat tersebut.Awalnya aku bosan dengan jalan ceritanya. Beberapa halaman awal hanya menceritakan tentang kehidupan keluarga Watson dan Hipwell, dan tentu saja Rachel. Lebih banyak mengarah ke romance. Dan ketika di halaman tersebut aku masih belum menemukan dimana letak thriller nya sehingga membuat aku berpikir apakah ini novel romance? :D Hingga ketika menghilangnya Megan, aku baru merasakan aura thriller :pBaca selengkapnya di http://anisaoktariani.blogspot.co.id/..."
586,Nathalia Borghi,"This was a very good mystery read! The only thing I did not enjoy were the different PoVs. They were a nive resource for telling the story, but it didn't seem like they were diverse characters. All three girls sounded the same.Apart from that, which is why a took away one star, i think it's an amazing book. The tension builds up nicely and the solution to the ""thingie"" was a great twist!"
587,Tajinder Singh,Fun fast clever whodunnit.
588,Elizabeth Wallen,"The Girl on the Train was described to me as a literary psychological thriller. I'm not sure what that means but I do know that was a terrific read. It had a classic Hitchcock vibe. It was like Vertigo, Suspicion, and Spellbound all rolled together. I would love to see this as a film but given the Hitchcock treatment. Rachel is an alcoholic. She has lost her job, her marriage, her self esteem. She rides the train into London every day in a face saving charade of normalcy. The train slows at the same spot on her route. She sees a nice residential neighborhood where her ex husband lives with his new wife and baby. She also sees the home of another young couple, a beautiful couple. She thinks of them as the perfect couple. Perhaps she thinks of them as how she and her ex husband used to be. She watches the beautiful couple in their garden, sitting on their patio, laughing, smiling, and affectionate. Then one day Rachel sees something disturbing...or did she? With Rachel's alcoholic blackouts, she isn't sure. And now the woman in this beautiful couple is missing. Is her memory true? What does it mean? Rachel is a damaged woman who is a ""stinking filthy drunk"" who has absolutely no credibility with anyone, including herself. This was a fascinating read. I was aggravated and impatient with Rachel and her drunkenness. But I sympathized with her desperate need to reconstruct her memories and to determine what was true. Excellent. "
589,Nel Domagalska,"I think this is my new favorite.I'm just so, so in love with the writing! Paula Hawkins is working actually on another thriller, and I'm really excited for this, after reading The Girl on the Train.The book made me suspect everyone and yell ""what the hell?!""- Oh, do you see what I did there? - actually for the last 150 pages. The feels I had while reading this book were soo strong!Though the ending wasn't as good as the rest of the book - I suspected that person all the time (but, as I said, I suspected everyone), it's a pretty amazing book. I still can't stop thinking about it and when I got out of the bus this morning and hid the book in my bag, I was wondering about the characters, about the actions, why, when, what? And this is what I call a good thriller.For a moment, just a few seconds, because of that one part that I'm still not sure I understand (view spoiler)[(Megan had her hand and something else stained with blood, and Rachel did to) (hide spoiler)] I thought that Megan and Rachel were really just one person. I immediately came back to mind that this is just impossible, but you don't know what other crazy explanations I had in mind! I was looking for so many strange reasons for all the actions that now I'm laughing at myself.The book was fantastic, blew my mind away. One star off because of the ending - it didn't fulfill me as much as I hoped."
590,Hanalei1208 Be,"Someone referred to this book as the new ""gone girl"" and I can see that is the case; it is difficult to like any of the main characters. Narrated by three different women at different time lines tells the story of a missing person. First observed by Rachel from the train she watches a couple and even gives them names. the reader figures out that it is her old neighborhood that she is observing from the train. The house she lived in with her ex husband is only a couple of doors down the street. He lives their now with his new wife and their newborn baby When Rachel observes the woman of this couple with a stranger at her house, she drinks even more and becomes obsessive. The other narrator is the ""new"" wife; Anna. This gives you a different look at the situations that involve Rachel who is an alcoholic. The third narrator is the missing person; Megan. She tells her story a year before she is going missing. The other two start when Megan is going missing. A fast read but not necessarily fun"
591,Pixie Dust,"Told from the perspectives of the three main female characters of the book, this story is a page-turner about the disappearance of one of the women and how the attempt of another to solve the mystery uncovers deadly secrets in the lives of the women and their husbands.This book has been touted as the next Gone Girl, but to my mind, Gillian Flynn’s Gone Girl is just a notch higher. The prose in Gone Girl is more beautiful, whereas that in The Girl on the Train is more functional and the book relies almost exclusively on the plot to engage the reader. And while Flynn manages to give her characters distinct individualities, the voices of the characters in The Girl on the Train seem to run together. The viewpoints alternate between the three female characters, but all the three women sound the same. At the beginning, before I had gotten a grasp of who is who, the frequent changes in point of view confused me, and several times I mistook one character for another, especially Anna and Rachel. The two main male characters are also portrayed very similarly. (view spoiler)[Both are violent, abusive and possessive, and one gets the sense that given more time, Scott would turn out to be another Tom. (hide spoiler)]For most of the book, the intrigue and twists made for a very satisfying read. (view spoiler)[I was surprised though that the truth is made quite explicit to the reader with more than a hundred pages to go. The rest of the book just plays out that denouement to its natural conclusion. I guess I’d expected further twists right to the end, given the nature of the book as a thriller. (hide spoiler)]"

""Sometimes things become possible if we want them bad enough."" -T.S. Eliot
This book was SO good! It really surprised me too, because I thought it was going to be taken in a different direction. When I read the synopsis, I thought that it was going to be like Alfred Hitchhock's Rear Window. You know, the main character see's something from outside, makes up her interpretation, and sets out to find out the truth.While some of those things did happen, the plot was different; it was completely the author's. The story is mostly told from Rachel's perspective. She's a divorced woman who's become an alcoholic since then, drinking any chance she can get. Everyday, she takes a train into London and she always passes by the street she used to live on. But that's not where her attention falls. Rather, she always looks to the house that's a couple doors down from her old one. In this house, there seem to be a loving, perfect couple. Rachel nicknames them Jason and Jess and it makes her day when she can see them being affectionate.Imagine her surprise when the woman she calls Jess ends up missing. Obviously the police think that the husband did it. Only Rachel doubts this. After all, she's watched them everyday. He's perfect, Jess was perfect, they were perfect. There's no way he could have killed his wife...right?

""Oh what a tangled web we weave,When first we practice to deceive!""

Rachel's character was brilliantly done. You feel empathy for her, for all that she's endured. A cheating husband, who divorced her for the other woman. The inability to have a child, especially when the mistress was able to give her ex-husband, Tom, one. So you understand why she's taken refuge in alcohol. Plus, she admits it! She knows she has a problem. But while all this is going on, you can't help but feel as if she's an unreliable character. Rachel has blackouts, sometimes even at key parts, and you're left wanting to know just what the hell happened at those parts! Also, you're totally rooting for her, the amateur detective trying to balance the mystery and her own messy life, which becomes harder as the plot starts to thicken and those two parts start to merge.Aside from Rachel, the characters of Megan, the missing wife, and Anna, the mistress, were also very well done. You really get a sense of who all these women are. Megan, the free-spirited woman trying so hard to stay in her nest with her husband Scott. Scott, who loved her with all his heart, who thought she was the perfect girl. Trying to let go of all the memories that haunt her, refusing to leave her, making her want to run, run, run away.
'But you can't give your heart to a wild thing: the more you do, the stronger they get. Until they're strong enough to run into the woods. Or fly into a tree. Then a taller tree. Then the sky. That's how you'll end up, Mr. Bell. If you let yourself love a wild thing. You'll end up looking at the sky.' -Truman Capote, Breakfast at Tiffany's
Anna, who loved being the other woman...maybe even more than she loves being a wife. Who loves her child very much, but misses the days when she was carefree and gorgeous. To be honest, I didn't like Anna. Megan, while not being perfect, I still liked more than Anna. My problem with Anna was that she seemed like a b*tch. Plus, I tend to be judgmental toward mistresses, especially when they feel no remorse for being the cause of a divorce. There, I said it.As for the plot, it was executed perfectly! The mystery was real, it was great, and you couldn't really cross out any of the main suspects until the end. I admit, I had a hunch about the real killer, oh, probably 60% of the way in. But I only thought that because I'm a fabulous detective and because (view spoiler)[I always think abut who would be the most shocking person to have done it. (hide spoiler)]I HIGHLY recommend this book! It's amazingly real, with none of the messiness of life glossed over. And with a great mystery!"
594,Megan McBeath Hay,"Wow. I started reading this book last night and it was one of those books where you find yourself going back and reading more at every spare moment, even if it's just a page. Hawkins creates three very interesting flawed women and three very interesting troubling perspectives. At times it is painful to read this book just because of how damaged these women are and how little they truly value themselves. It's been a while since I read a book that executed a twist well. When the twist hits it's not totally unexpected because the clues have been there all along cleverly hidden, however, it's still a twist - it's not where you thought the book was leading you. My parting bit of advice is don't read this book if you are looking to have your faith in humanity restored."
595,Grace Bushong,"Kept me reading! And it was so interesting to have a character struggling with alcoholism narrating. However, I don't feel like I learned anything interesting or deep from it, it's a lighter read. I also find it not believable that Rachel eventually remembers things from when she was blacked out... If her brain was not making memories then she would not be able to just remember them later"

597,Laney,"Hmmm. Debating on the stars. I think it had way too many F words for 4 stars, but 3 stars doesn't seem like enough. I never really read psychological thrillers or murder mysteries because I'm a wuss and I hate scary movies and I get freaked out easily. But this was ""assigned"" to me for book club, and I totally enjoyed it, surprising myself. All the people in this book are so messed up that I couldn't decide who the bad guy/girl was the entire book, because it could have been any of them! Which made it super fun to read. The chapters jumped around chronologically and that was a bit tough when listening on audio, but I figured it out. I could totally see this as a movie too - the next Gone Girl. Fun, addicting read! "

Gelelim kitabın bana hissettirdiklerine...İlk 150 sayfa falan benim için ölüm gibiydi, kitaba gerçekten büyük umutlarla başlamıştım ve o ilk 150 sayfa yüzünden kesin 3 falan veririm diye düşünerek moralimi bozdum. Yazarın ilk 200 sayfa falan boyunca bir tek ipucu bile vermemesi beni deli etti.Ciddi anlamda ÇILDIVDIM. 200'den sonra anca minik minik ipuçları ortaya çıktı Rachel ufak ufak hatırlamaya başladı olayları falan ama bu süre boyunca da HATIRLA BE KADIN diye Rachel'a atar yaptım. 250.sayfada falan tam böyle katille (ne denir ki buna?)

603,Jen ,"4.5 starsMINI REVIEW:Landing on the bestseller shelves in multiple bookstores, I knew I wanted to check out The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins. It’s been compared to Gone Girl – which I admittedly have not read – but if it’s being compared to a popular thriller, I’m in. I didn’t read the synopsis at all, simply because the title is vague and peaks my interest already. I wanted to go into this story with no idea what the story is about – that’s the best part about psychological thrillers.Without spoiling anything at all, I have to say that The Girl on the Train is an addictive read. Hawkins sets the mystery up really well, with multiple components, but clear nonetheless. There are three perspectives, but I feel that the voices are distinct enough to keep straight in your head. I completely did not guess the killer at all, which is also a huge bonus! The one thing I didn’t like about this story is that none of the characters are likeable. They are all incredibly flawed, and not redeemable in any case. The main character simply gets involved because she is bored and lonely, and a bit desperate for attention from her ex. This is strangely one of those stories where I was fully invested in the story without any connection to the characters.I highly recommend The Girl on the Train if you’re in for a thrilling ride (ahah, get it, RIDE?) even if the characters are difficult to like. I got the creeps throughout the entire time I read this book, simply because Hawkins’ writing style is blunt and to the point, not distracting the reader from the plot at hand.Check out this review and more at Books and Other Happy Ever Afters"
604,Becca Mataloni,"I enjoyed this book because everyone is full of secrets, and it keeps you interested and guessing. However, I felt it was a long build-up to the end where all secrets are unveiled and you learn of the murderer (although I rightly suspected from the beginning). The characters were well-developed, but overall, there was a lot of unnecessary middle filler. Highly recommended, though!"
605,Leslie Kamenszky,"This one was a page turner for me, especially the last 50 pages or so. I like that it was told from the female characters' point of view. Good read!"
606,Amber,"I really enjoyed this as it was told from multiple characters' perspectives and highlighted their connectedness, even though some of the characters did not know one another in real life. I also enjoy unreliable narrators, so this hit the spot. A nice mystery that kept me guessing for quite some time and then had me kicking myself for not figuring out the killer sooner. "
607,Margaret Kuo,"I predicted the ending but I still loved reading this book. It's everything you want from a thriller: fast-paced, intriguing plot-development, and train-wreck characters that keep you fascinated. "
608,Lilac Wolf,"How did I not know this was a mystery/thriller??? I mean seriously...I was expecting a happy story. Then when I started to read and it wasn't happy, I figured, oh chick lit. She'll get her poop together and then we'll all be happy.I'd classify this as a thriller.Rachel rides the train into London every day. Not to work, but to hide that she no longer has a job. When she looks out where she used to live...she focuses on a few houses before her old place. In a way to avoid looking at her old life that she just can't seem to get over. She makes up this whole story of the couple that lives there. Then one day, she sees the woman she has named Jess with another man. Rachel is furious, how could Jess do that to her wonderful husband? When Jess ends up missing, Rachel feels it is her duty to come forward with what she knows.The story also follows Meagan, the missing woman and Anna the new wife of Rachel's ex-husband. But I feel, after reading it all, that really Rachel is the key figure. Maybe I just like her the best - lol. Oh did I mention Rachel drinks way too much and Anna is about ready to get a restraining order on her? And yet, I still like her better...This book just whipped by keeping me on the edge of my seat until the very end. In the beginning it's not real exciting, more of laying the groundwork for the true ride at the end. Like Gone Girl, this story just grabbed me and kept me guessing until the very end. "
609,Ben,"Book ReviewThe Girl on the Train by Paula HawkinsTransworld BooksRachel is having a hard time of it. Her marriage has broken down, and her husband Tom has moved on to Anna. They have started the family that Anna and Tom never could have. Rachel travels on the same train everyday to a job that she lost nine months earlier, due to her problems with Alcohol. She wants to keep the pretence of a job and a good income to her land lady, but she drinks on the train, has moments of blacking out, and is soon shown to be both unreliable and deceitful.She looks into the houses she passes and fixes on the seemingly perfect lives of ‘Jess and Jason’.However, their lives are not perfect, and when ‘Jess’ or Megan in reality goes missing, Rachel has to make a life changing decision about what she has seen, and what she thinks she knows.The Girl on the Train is Paula Hawkins debut novel, and has spent many weeks at the top of best-seller lists. Her background is in Journalism means that she can write in a way that is both literary, but also deals with the small details and grubby little faults that exist within all of our lives.Rachel is show to be an unreliable narrator, and the story is also told by Anna, who dislikes Rachel for the past she has with Tom, and it is also told in flashback, from the perspective of Megan. When the Police arrive their investigation is hampered by Rachel, who the police dismiss, but as the story unfolds, we realise that the murderer is a lot closer to home and that the main character are all in danger.The Girl on the Train is both a thriller, but it is also a novel about humanity, about the problems that we all face, and the issues that colour our everyday lives.Hawkins is a name and a talent to watch."
610,V Audio Nerd ,The only book that I have really liked while simultaneously hating every character !
611,Eva,"This book was fifty shades of psycho!! Extremely dysfunctional characters, can't-put-it-down suspense! I had the feeling I was being watched;a great thriller!"
612,Taylor,"Wow. I enjoyed this a lot more than Gone Girl. I've seen so many similarities between the two, but this book has more depth.____________________Favorite character: RachelFirst sentence: ""There is a pile of clothing on the side of the train tracks.""Important quote: ""Hollowness: that I understand. I'm starting to believe that there isn't anything you can do to fix it. That's what I've taken from the therapy sessions: the holes in your life are permanent. You have to grow around them, like tree roots around concrete; you mold yourself through the gaps."""
613,Gerardo,"A lo largo de toda la historia fue cambiando mi percepción acerca de cada personaje que aparecía en la misma, excepto de Cathy, ella siempre fue igual jajaja, sin duda alguna recomiendo esta novela, que te llenará de intriga y querrás seguir leyendo hasta saber el final! Sobre todo ya en las últimas 100? Páginas, donde ya no pude detenerme. El final ha estado bien, aunque me falta aclarar un poco todo, pero en general, ha esta muy bien todo! :)"
614,Bev,"My favourite crime writer, Karin Slaughter wrote about this book:""Good thriller, but no Gone Girl. Everyone wants to be the next Gillian Flynn, but Gillian Flynn isn't finished being Gillian Flynn.""I completely agree. It irritates me that every book that has an unreliable narrator, or an unexpected violent streak is touted as the next Gone Girl. Those were not the only good things about Gone Girl. Also, isn't it a bit pretentious, comparing your first novel to a really successful one, with a movie?That is my rant, now about this book: It's jolly good. I liked the premise. I really enjoyed the characters - a lot of research is evident, and the prose is excellent. Highly recommended. Couldn't stop listening/reading.http://bevbouwer.blogspot.com/2015/04..."
615,Maxine (Booklover Catlady),"This will be one of the stand out novels of 2015 I believe. I am sick of it being yet another book that is being compared to Gone Girl. Pfft to that. I think this is way better anyway, but can we stop the comparisons now? I really enjoyed every minute of The Girl on the Train.The Girl on the Train just swept me away into a reading world where from the second half of the book on I did not do anything but let my eyes absorb and my imagination do it's thing. It was brilliant. I will admit it was a little bit confusing at first as I tried to piece together who was who and who was talking in the chapter but that soon subsided until I was totally enthralled and hooked. Rachel catches the same commuter train every morning. She knows it will wait at the same signal each time, overlooking a row of back gardens. She’s even started to feel like she knows the people who live in one of the houses. ‘Jess and Jason’, she calls them. Their life – as she sees it – is perfect. If only Rachel could be that happy.And then she sees something shocking. It’s only a minute until the train moves on, but it’s enough.Now everything’s changed. Now Rachel has a chance to become a part of the lives she’s only watched from afar.Now they’ll see; she’s much more than just the girl on the train…This book is full of psychological twists and turns, just when you think you have it all worked out it shifts gears and direction, then again, then again until you are resigned to the fact you may truly not know until the end. With an undercurrent of tension and creepy factor it's a great book, it really knows how to suck you in. The plot builds cleverly until you are desperate to know the truth and by the time you get it you are exhausted from being on edge for it. The characters are all really interesting with light and shade in all, not everybody is who they seem to be, who can you trust? What is the truth? Take my advice and try to not work it out as you will get brain fuddle.A fantastic 2015 release, put this one on your list for sure this year. It's a winner. 4.5 stars from me. It did not reach 5 stars only due to me being a touch confused as to what was going on in the first few chapters, but maybe I am just a bit stoooopid. Enjoy this one!I received an ARC from the publisher in exchange for an honest review. Many thanks."
616,Adrith Bicchieri,"One of the senior librarians at work was raving about this title one day, how it was the next Gone Girl and the waitlist was growing exponentially, and exhorting our colleagues to get on the waitlist ASAP. Suspense was never my genre, but I put on my big girl pants, told myself that I needed to broaden my reading, and added my name. My copy came in sooner than I expected, and I have spent the last week using lunch breaks and wait times to read. Every time I would find myself out of time and wishing I had just a little bit more - and finally one snowy night I went to bed early and finished it in one sitting.The story's protagonist is truly human, and I cheered for her as she struggled with her demons and tried to find answers for the huge questions the story posed. I was surprised at the revelation of the multiple-layered plot's missing piece at the end. The fast pace and compelling journey made for an enjoyable reading experience.I am glad I gave this title a try![Placed on wait list at Owings Mills on staff recommendation.

618,Lois,"Started reading it yesterday, finished today.First of all, I'm so tired of every new ""thriller"" being hailed as ""the new Gone Girl"". I loved Gone Girl. I couldn't wait to read it, so I bought it almost as soon as it came out, and did not regret that for one minute. I also enjoyed the movie made from it. With this one, I was very anxious to read it (I love psychological thrillers), but now that I have, I'm glad I waited for the library's copy to be available to me.Don't get me wrong. I liked this one a lot. But for all the talk of all the twists in it, I just didn't see that many. I liked the basic story, and the beginning was probably the most interesting part for me, when the woman on the train is imagining the lives of the people in the houses she peers into as the train passes them every day. But while I can still remember big parts of Gone Girl (and could, even before the movie came out), with this one I really think what I'll remember most is the part I just mentioned, and then the fact that the main character was so stinkin' drunk all the time that she often didn't know what was going on. Every time something happened she'd swear she was going to stop drinking, while that same thing that happened drove her right to it. That got a little tiresome for me. "
619,Jeni,"If you liked Gone Girl, this is better. Take three unreliable narrators, a couple of nasty men and twist!"
620,Jenn,"First off, a pet peeve: why is it so often in British fiction that the main character tells SO MANY senseless lies? I noticed it first in Brit chick lit, but it's here too. I LOATHE this. It makes me cringe through the entire book. I mean, I get why you might not tell the truth about a lot of these things, but there's a difference between just denying or a little lying to cover up what you don't want people to know, but these are MASSIVE lies these people tell. Gah!Okay, on with the review. The first part of this book bored me. Nothing much was happening except we read about this pathetic girl who's obsessed with riding the train. I was so bored. But then it picked up. I enjoyed the ride with this one despite the fact that every single characters in this book was incredibly flawed and unlikable. I also found that I kept forgetting exactly who was who. Even near the end of the book, I'd look at the chapter name and have to actually sit and think about who it was we were talking about. I'm not sure why that is since there really is only 6 characters in this book. (yes, the roommate and the red-haired guy, but I mean anyone who matters). There's no one at all to root for in this book. Maybe, if you're reading this, you can help me. So, did Megan (Yep, I totally had to pause and try and remember her name) actually have an affair with the psychologist or did she just come on to him and we only THOUGHT she did because of the way it was written. I liked the book and am curious, but I'm not curious enough to go back and see if she actually named him when we read those chapters. If it wasn't him, that's a nifty bit of subterfuge there. Also, what was the deal with the ginger? That went absolutely nowhere. "
621,Lori,"Super book for reading group discussion. Made me super glad I did not live in an area where commuting by train was required! It was easy to see how daily commuters could become familiar enough with homes and their occupants to the extent they felt as if they know them. But when taken to the next step of making up names for the occupants or going to those homes acting as if you do know them, that is freaky!Having a friend that would allow you to move into a second bedroom, until you can get back on your feet, is truely a good friend. To take advantage of that and not work, spend money on alcohol and not help with the rent AND lie to your friend making her think you are taking the train to work every day is inexcusable! There is only so much a ""friend"" can take - - I was fed up LONG before the eviction note was written.The Girl on the Train had some serious mental issues. It was difficult to tell if she caused her problems due to self-pity and low self-esteem or if she truely was a few cards short of a deck! She surely made all of her problems worse by self-medicating with alcohol and pills."
622,"Kirsten *Dogs Welcome - People Tolerated""","It seems like every book club I'm in picked this to read either last month, this month, or next month! It's got a huge waiting list at my library but I finally got it and it was definitely worth the wait!My house back up against a gully (small canyon) and you can see and hear the people on the other side. (It has great acoustics! A couple of summers back, I heard a belching contest from the other side. Gross!) I have caught myself fantasizing what would happen if I heard or saw something salacious or criminal happening over there. This book brings that to mind. This debut (!!!) novel is a compulsive page turner. When I first read the blurb, I thought that Rachel actually saw a criminal act, but it's more subtle than that. It's the book Gone Girl should have been.The story is told in a wonderful way from the pov of three different women. It was very effective and it kept me guessing. At times I was sympathetic towards Rachel and other times I distrusted her. This was very adept of the author. It made one of our narrators unreliable. I really enjoyed this read and hope Ms Hawkins follows it up soon."
623,Tania Lukinyuk,"(Review in Russian to follow below) Over the years, married life was represented in literature as safe harbour full of love, calmness and joy. All the fun was happening with singles. Well, not anymore. Paula Hawkins seems to pick up from the Australian Liane Moriarty on showing family as set of troubled wives, evil husbands, dead-end relationships rather than as ideal couples. Guess what? Such families poise ideal setting for a murder or two.Quite unusually the story is being told not by a traditional 'ideal wife/mother' but by a divorcee with alcohol issues, no job and very few friends left (actually just one) dreaming of perfect family life. This adds to overall perception of reality of this book. You can recognize some people in characters, and sometimes, with awe, you recognize yourself.I just quickly guessed who the murderer is, that is why a 4-star.Семейная жизнь в популярной современной литературе уже долго представляется этакой бухтой спокойствия, любви и радости. Традиционно, все самое увлекательное происходит до, после или вместо брака. Так было, но не теперь. Пола Хоукинс продолжает традиции австралийской писательницы Лиан Мориарти и представляет семью, не как идеальный союз, а как жен с проблемами, непростых мужей, бессмысленных отношений. И знаете что? Такие семьи представляют прекрасную почву для убийства. Или нескольких убийств.Необычно и то, что история рассказывается через призму восприятия женщины, переживающей сложный период в жизни, пьющей, безработной, практически одинокой. Это добавляет восприятие реальности книги. Среди героев книги ты узнаешь людей, которых знаешь в жизни, а иногда - с ужасом - и себя.Я только быстро поняла, кто убийца, поэтому оценка на 4 звезды."
624,Sharon,"This is a real page turner! I read it in just one week, and couldn't wait to find out who the real culprit was. The reason I cannot give it 5 stars is because I could not like any of the characters. In fact, they annoyed me. The main character, Rachel, is seriously flawed. That in itself does not make her unlikeable, but the way she dealt with what she witnessed was, in my opinion, messed up. I also did not like the way she kept her patient, long-suffering roommate, Cathy, in the dark. No explanation is needed to understand why I found Anna and Megan unlikeable. As for Tom and Scott, well, I will let them speak for themselves. If you are getting the sense that there were a lot of characters in this story, you would be right. This is another reason I cannot give this book 5 stars. It keeps jumping back and forth between characters, without fully developing any one character. To add to the confusion two of these characters, Anna and Scott, are sometimes referred to as Jess and Jason. Hoping this author will provide more background information on characters in future books. She definitely has a talent for suspense."
625,Fragmentage,I liked this multi-pov-thriller a lot and the narrators did a great job imho. While I felt sad most of the time for most of the people involved I thought the author succeeded very well in conveying the mindset and struggles of trauma victims and addicts as well as the complexity of their seemingly normal relationships.
626,Kelly Kittel,"“Life is not a paragraph, and death is no parenthesis.” Loved this line and this book was a compelling summer escape. Sure, the characters were all flawed, but who doesn’t love to read about folks who are more screwed up than you are every now and again? Plenty, if you go by the 36,550-ish Goodreads reviews anyway. Even at her worst, Rachel, the alcoholic protagonist, still has some lovable and wise moments such as this, “I’d never realized, not until the last year or two of my life, how shaming it is to be pitied.” A sober thought indeed, Sister, I thought since one of the many facets of being a bereaved parent is learning to be the object of unwanted pity. I also agreed with her thoughts about her inability to conceive, “The thing about being barren is that you’re not allowed to get away from it,” and about her Ex, “He never understood that it’s possible to miss what you’ve never had, to mourn for it.” It was also refreshing to read a book written in the Queen’s own English complete with words like “quieten” and all those extra u’s and I was happy that, unlike Harry Potter, they didn’t feel the need to translate it for us dumb Americans. “A 1960’s new town, spreading like a tumour over the heart of Buckinghamshire.” Maybe it’s me, but somehow tumour seems a bit gentler than our u-less version. And if I ever do get one, regardless of how it's spelled, now I know that I can buy gin and tonic in a can."
627,Theresa Vivona,"Good story, but character development was a bit cumbersome at times. Still enjoyed it, despite some slow points."
628,Mary Catherine,Great mystery. 
629,Jessica Woodbury,"The book is kind of like a train. If you give it a little time, you'll find that it starts moving really fast. This isn't a book for everyone. It's a book with 3 female narrators, none of whom are terribly likeable. Especially Rachel, the titular center of the book, a woman who has lost her job and her husband due to her destructive alcoholic tendencies. Still, Hawkins knows how to build a riveting story and keep it moving. I know a good thriller because I'll feel like we're moving so quickly we must be near the end only to look down at my Kindle and see I'm only 40% of the way through. This was definitely one of those. "
630,Valerie Campbell Ackroyd,"I started this book on Audible, facing an 8 hour drive. Within ten minutes I was completely engrossed (not so that I didn't watch the road though.) Sometimes when you listen to a book rather than read it, you can get confused about the action. Not with this one, although it is quite complicated, switching voices between three different characters, at three different times. We first meet Rachel, who we quickly realize is an unemployed alcoholic, living vicariously through other people, assuming a complete life story for a couple she sees out of a train window. Then she sees something that disturbs her so much that she becomes involved in their lives. And in the lives of her ex-husband and his new wife and child.As the words tumble from her, and from Megan, the young woman that Rachel has seen from a train and finally from Anna, Rachel's ex-husband's new wife, we see that the first assumptions we made about Rachel--that she is crazy, lives in an alcohol-indused fog,--may have been wrong. Or at least the situation is far more complicated than we first thought. Rather like we ourselves are people in a train, gazing at Rachel's puffy face, crazy mutterings, so embarrassed that we turn to look out of the train and see a couple in a yard living an idyllic life and think ""That's what happiness is."" Maybe. Maybe not. I read the last two hours of the book on my Kindle--straight through. I couldn't let go of Rachel's, Meg's and Anna's story. Although when you use a long lens after reading the book, the plot was simple, Hawkins has managed to put so many nuances into it that never once did I say (as I sometimes do with mystery/thrillers) ""Oh that was a cheat."" This is no cheat. This is a great book."
631,Lynne,"I enjoyed this a lot. Quite a beach read, and better than Gone Girl, for me, because Rachel is SUCH an unreliable narrator that there's no way of knowing what's what. I figured out ""who did it"" somewhat earlier than I'd like to have, but it didn't stop it from being a good, well written yearn."
632,Diane Smoak,The most depressing book I can remember reading! Still a good story.
633,Jolien,Uitgelezen op nog geen 24 uur tijd. Aanrader!
634,Jeri,"I didn't think I was going to like this book after reading the first few chapters, mostly due to the main character's repeated behavior. It was getting old. Then, the other characters started to develop and the plot started to thicken. I definitely didn't see then ending happening the way it did, but it was great. I enjoyed the suspense and thrill of the story."
635,Abracalibro Blog Literario,"
La chica del tren es un interesante y adictivo thriller de acción que busca algo más que proporcionar al lector un mero entretenimiento. Hawkins nos abre las puertas de la mente de una protagonista que, superada por su propia vida, se ve involucrada en turbios asuntos de secretos, mentiras y muerte. A pesar de que el resto del elenco no está a la altura del personaje principal, se trata de una novela que vale la pena leer gracias a su bien construida trama donde no faltan las escenas de misterio. Lee nuestra reseña completa aquí."
636,Peach Berry,"Much in the vain of Gone Girl, this book deals with the intricacies of relationships and the lies that bind us. I really enjoyed this book, the plot and pace were gripping and the author even managed to place some empathy with highly unlikeable characters. It is the plot that makes the book so strong in its delivery, it's intrigue as the tangled lives of the three main characters, surrounding the tragic death of a young woman, become clearer.A great novel and well worth a read if you're a crime/suspense fan. "
637,Lola ,Pfffiou... I feel like I've been holding my breath for 325 pages and only now finally exhaled.
638,Bigsna,"Picked it up after reading some rave reviews that compared it to Gone Girl, some calling it better than that and others calling it the book of the year so far. I quite enjoyed reading it and it's one of those books you want to keep turning the pages of, telling yourself , ok one more chapter before I sleep. What I liked about the book were two things - first, that every chapter was a narrative from a character's perspective mapped to dates and times that sometimes had to be cross referenced to understand the sequence of events; and second, the very indirect way of tying disjointed lives together with a single event and weaving in the psychology of each person. Also really liked the way the author depicts the helplessness of an out of control alcoholic and the vicious circle of weakness she is stuck in.What I missed was that ""oh my god,no!!"" moment ---- which isn't necessarily a negative, since everything unfurls slowly and is constantly in a state of un-clarity until it finally comes to the fore. All in all, one of the ""must reads"" this year, especially all afternoon, tucked in bed on a stormy day like I did :-)"
639,Natalie,"This was a great thriller. It reminded me a bit of ""Before I Go to Sleep"" in that you're trying to figure out what happened right along with the characters. I definitely recommend this one. "
640,Natalia,"Rachel is a strange kind of narrator. She’s not entirely reliable, likable enough, but at the same time – pathetic. Her marriage disintegrated and she let herself loose, falling as low as a woman possibly can. Tom, the husband, married the mistress, they had a child together and still, Rachel was stubbornly drawn to man that wasn’t hers for years. She became an alcoholic, her behavior was erratic and borderline insane. Every day she rides the train to work she no loner has and daydreams about imaginary lives of families living along the train tracks. Rachel is the girl on the train, finding a form of comfort in the lives of strangers safe at home. Her overactive imagination leads her into a murder web. An interesting note about the other characters – they all are guilty of something – liars, adulterers, emotional abusers, obsessed… They are human, but they also are flawed, very much so…Ultimately, The Girl on the Train is a first-class debut thriller, well-written, entertaining and keeping you guessing whodunit till the very last chapters.I would definitely be looking forward to the adaptation."
641,Cristi Macovei,"Overall the book was good, but the characters were under-developed, it was quite slow to start, I barely read the first 1/4 of the book in 2 days, but after that, it became very addicting and I couldn't let it down.Even though the ending caught me off-guard, I still was expecting a bigger plot-twist. And the ending was really abrupt, I was expecting probably something else, something more elaborate, thrilling, perhaps another plot twist.If I'd analyze the book and see everything I didn't like, the review would probably be 3 stars, but since I enjoyed reading it, I'll try to see the positive part and give it 4*."
642,Edurne,"El año pasado fue Gone Girl, pero este año este libro me ha conquistado. Una historia de esas que te hacen pensar y darle mil vueltas a la trama. Este tipo de novelas son las que enganchan hasta el final. Muy recomendable."
643,Jackie,I really enjoyed this psychological thriller. Many unexpected twists and turns made this murder mystery right up my alley.
644,Adiafaith,"4.5 (but dammit I wish I could give it 5) StarsI've heard so much from friends regarding this book, both good and bad, that I felt compelled to read it and see what all the commotion was about. First off, this book is engaging. The first few pages started off slow but when it picked up pace, I found myself consuming each word to the point that I became frustrated when I had to put the book down to, you know, live my life. A part of what made this so engaging and entertaining is that the author takes unreliable narration to another level with the main character Rachel. Rachel, who is dealing with alcohol addiction (and a host of other issues), spends most of the book either drinking or intoxicated or struggling to recover from one of her many blackouts that you never can be sure if what she's seeing, saying, or remembering is real and thusly if what you're reading ever happened or the puzzle pieces you're holding even exist. (Admittedly I initially questioned if Megan had even disappeared (view spoiler)[but quickly let go of that denial when I noticed the chapters from Megan's POV were set in the past (hide spoiler)].) In addition to her alcohol addiction, there are times when Rachel spends the book holding on to child-like fantasies about the other characters and the world around her or just flat out lying that teasing out what parts are reality and truthful, respectively, become challenging. With these qualities for the main person narrating, there was never a dull moment. I found myself experiencing so many different emotions when it came to Rachel. Overall, I was sympathetic towards her character because it was clear that she'd experienced trauma that was unbearable for her and influenced her need to exist within a fantasy. On the other hand, there were many times when I got frustrated and angry with her. Rachel appeared intent on unraveling this mystery of Megan's disappearance and I felt as if I was sitting in the train seat right next to her, seeing the mystery through her eyes and rooting for her to figure it out. Each time she looked as if she had another crucial puzzle piece put together (or maybe not, but it seemed like it) and would then take a drink, I about lost it. It was like ""Rachel, can you seriously not stay sober for just two fucking more minutes so you can figure this damn thing out?!"" As much as this pissed me off, I have to say, it generated so much suspense as you realize there is something so sinister in those memories hidden within the haze of her blackouts and by not uncovering those memories it keeps that threat of ""who did what"" and ""who can you trust"" looming throughout the story. (Much respect to the author on the precision given to the editing of this book).Secondly, this book is told solely from the perspective of women and the author does an interesting job of spotlighting and then pulling apart certain gender stereotypes. There's Rachel who is repeatedly dismissed throughout the book and labeled as crazy, a drunk, and ""a rubbernecker"" when she displays anger, panic, fear or confusion regarding what is occurring around her. At first glance, you could point to her alcohol abuse as the factor but it goes beyond that. In a scene with the detectives, she is questioned regarding how she reacted to her husband cheating on her and starting a family with the woman he cheated with and when she was deemed as having not dealt with that betrayal in an ""acceptable"" manner, she was labeled by the detectives as erratic and unstable (meaning ""too emotional"") and then ultimately dismissed. As a reader, I noticed times where I questioned her credibility and then had to stop to question why I was doing this, especially considering I was experiencing similar feelings of fear and anxiety in response to the perceived threat during certain scenes. Then there is Megan who through the eyes of Rachel (and others) appears to personify the ""perfect"" woman: pretty, dutiful wife, and cares for the household. Yet on closer inspection she's suffocating within the confines of her marriage and battling her own trauma history, which brings complexity to her character. (view spoiler)[ The moment when it's revealed in the news that she does not fit the perfect ""nurturer/caregiver"" role, she's dismissed as deserving of whatever has happened to her. (hide spoiler)] And lastly there's Anna who engaged in a sexual relationship with Tom while he was married to Rachel. Anna comes across as entitled, smug, self-important, and self-centered, which is a far cry from the warm and submissive gender expectations for women. I noticed in reviews that Anna seems to get the most vitriol (labeled in sexist means as a ""homewrecker"" or demonized for her attitude towards Rachel and her relationship with Tom) which is fascinating since I found her to have a mindset similar to most ""alpha male"" characters I come across in romance fiction. Anna is equally compelling as Rachel and Megan, albeit not quite as fleshed out character-wise, in that Anna plays into some stereotypes of women as flirts and needing to be desired to get what she wants but then acts and thinks in ways that are so outside of our assumptions for the way women should behave that leaves her unpredictable. Lastly, the book has enough twists and turns to keep the reader guessing. (view spoiler)[I thought at one point that maybe Megan and Anna didn't exist, then I questioned if they were different personalities within Rachel, then I trusted that they were three separate people but maybe Rachel was responsible for Megan's disappearance...but then I thought it was Anna.  (hide spoiler)] My only issue was this book was anti-climatic and a bit of a letdown when the final mystery is revealed. Typically, I'd downgrade like crazy because of that but due to how engaging the rest of the story is, I'm willing to overlook it...slightly."
645,Nogueira,"Gostei muito! Já tinha ouvido falar muito deste livro e finalmente li-o... Achei particularmente interessante a forma como está escrito, não como uma narrativa convencional, mas sim como uma sucessão de textos escritos na primeira pessoa, como se fossem entradas de um diário (ou blog) das principais personagens, permitindo um ponto de vista único e muito pessoal sobre o desenrolar da historia... O ponto de partida é extremamente simples e eficaz, uma rapariga a atravessar um mau momento da sua vida, nas suas deslocações diárias de comboio entre os subúrbios o centro de Londres observa o que a rodeia a partir da janela da carruagem, particularmente quando este pára num semáforo que fica mesmo em frente às traseiras de uma casa num bairro onde ela já morou e onde um jovem casal parece muito feliz a tomar o seu café matjnal... os problemas começam quando ela se decide envolver na vida das pessoas que observa. A autora desenvolve um trabalho notável na construção dos varios personagens e na sua desconstrução... sim, pq nem tudo é tão simples e linear como parece e os acontecimentos vão rasteirando o leitor, fazendo-o mudar de opiniao sobre cada um dos intervenientes ao longo da historia. Apesar da reviravolta final não me ter surpreendido muito (já vi muito filme e já li muito livro policial e consegui prever muita coisa) o livro prendeu-me e manteve-me acordado este sábado até o acabar. Uma estreia muito promissora desta autora, fico curioso quanto ao seu próximo trabalho!"
646,Alaine,Excellent thriller. Rachel gets involved with two families whom she watched while riding into London daily. All characters are richly developed. The plot just got better and better. The twists are unexpected. Didn't see the ending coming. 
647,Molly Mason,"I read my first (and only) thriller back in 2012. It came in the form of The Poison Tree by Erin Kelly and although it still remains one of my favourite stories, I had already watched the ITV adaptation prior to reading the book, so it wasn't as 'thrilling' as a thriller should be. 3 years later, I have read my second thriller and although it will never be my favourite genre, I thoroughly enjoyed the exciting, suspenseful plot of The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins. As this book is still making it's rounds through endless cafes, beaches, living rooms, busses and trains around the world, I don't want to give anything away that may spoil the unexpected ending. The important thing about reading a book is that you can put yourself in the position of the characters. That you can put yourself in this persons shoes and think 'Yeah, I can see why you're doing this', 'I can understand why you're acting this way', and I definitely felt this way towards Rachel. Her actions may have been drastic and most of the time I was worried sick about her, but it wasn't difficult for me to put myself in her position and I quickly came to the realisation that I could easily become a Rachel myself under those circumstances.It's also important for an author to write characters that you trust and Paula has expertly written Anna, Megan, Tom and Scott. Again, I don't want to give anything away but Paula has managed to write the perfect mix of characters that you wouldn't trust one bit only to realise that they were innocent people alongside characters that you would trust with your life only to realise that they would stab you right in the back. I trusted certain characters so much that I felt like I knew them, just as Rachel felt about 'Jess and Jason', and I felt cheated to find out I had trusted the wrong people all along. The Girl on the Train itself is a thrill ride but I did find that the suspense of what was going to happen in the end was more exciting than the conclusion itself. Although, the suspense itself is enough to read this book whether you were satisfied with the ending or not. But all I can say is, if you're a fan of this genre and think you've solved hundreds of fictional murders before, don't try and solve Megan's murder because you just won't see it coming."
648,Kruimel,"Ik heb getwijfeld tussen vijf en vier sterren. Vijf omdat het boek enorm vlot leest. Het opzet en de vertelstijl grijpen je onmiddellijk bij je kraag. Vier omdat het einde niet de ommezwaai had die ik hoopte. Maar zoek je naar een spannende en vlotte pageturner, die echt wel even blijft hangen. Dan is dit je boek. "
649,Cinthia,From the beginning this story touched my heart as I was able to relate to the beginning of the story... it wasn't until towards the end that this story truly shifted... I felt so bad for Rachel all throughout her ordeal and at the same time anna surprised me at how she defended Rachel even though anna hated her.. It was a very sad ending for Meghan but life has a way of cashing in before you move on.. over all it was well written and relayed...
650,Elke,"Erg spannend boek! Goed opgebouwd en gelijk meeslepend. Het middenstuk was iets te langdradig naar mijn mening en hier en daar kwam ik in de war met de namen. Maar dat is gewoon iets van mij denk ik. Zeker vier sterren waard, al denk ik niet dat het een boek is dat me eeuwig bij zal blijven."
651,Brian Forte,"It's no surprise that this book keeps being referred to as ""this year's  Gone Girl."" A whole cast of despicable characters? Check. Shifting narrators and timelines? Check. Murder, mystery, mayhem? Check, check, check. And while The Girl on the Train was a thrilling page-turner, I ultimately found the hype and GG comparisons to work to its detriment. The middle of the story was a little underbaked and repetitive, when all I really wanted to do was get to the exciting, pulpy conclusion. I still definitely recommend this book, but would perhaps suggest leaving the Gillian Flynn comparisons at the door."
652,Leslie,Couldn't put it down. 
653,Andi (A Literal Hottie),"I hated all 3 of the narrators, Rachel (the girl on the train) is an alcoholic and lives a pathetic existence, Megan is a slut, then you've got the husband stealing Anna--- I hated them all but I still loved the book. It's a quick read, interesting and while I don't have much experience with this genre I know this was a great enjoyable read. "
654,Ann Weisz,Couldn't put this book down. Thriller from start to finish as the characters develop.
655,Filipa,"4,5 stars This book was disturbing in so many ways. Really, really good, awesome actually but it shook me a little. The first 30/40 pages depressed me so much, I wanted to give up the reading. Everything was so hopeless, grey, sad - it really ruined my happy mood. It drained all my positivism! But after that, I couldn't stay away. This book is dark. The characters are dark, very intense and troubled. Everyone here would probably go to Hell if such a thing existed in this book. I reacted very strongly to every character in this book. These people terrified me and fascinated me at once. Rachel disgusted me sometimes although she makes a very interesting and also very improbable detective! She challenged my feelings for her every step of the way.The mystery is interesting, not the best I've read, but it keeps you going and it keeps you interested in the development of the story. I found out who the killer was more or less in the middle of the book but there are a few convincing red herrings throughout. Anyway, what really got me in this reading was the human factor - everybody is so disturbed. This book is really interesting to analyse in a psychological perspective. "
656,Katie,"The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins is a fast-paced murder mystery with lots of twists and turns throughout. It is July 2013 and Rachel, a middle-aged single woman, commutes by train to London every day. She has memorized everything about the trip, from the stops to the landscape, and has become particularly fascinated by a happy couple she sees almost everyday. But then one day she sees something new and she cannot let it go. And then the rug is pulled out from underneath her when her dreamy couple becomes one of London's most intriguing headlines.The similarities between this novel to Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl are uncanny. This story is told from multiple perspectives; people's ""truths"" are never really as they seem; and there is even a male-female police duo. This story is also told in alternating viewpoints and flashes backward and forward in time. Readers will follow Rachel and two other female characters as the search for answers in all of their lives unfolds. This book was easy to read and intriguing but the ending left me with a little longing for something more. I enjoyed the development of the lead character, Rachel, but honestly felt this was too similar to Gone Girl. Readers who enjoy murder mysteries, thrillers, and dysfunctional female characters will enjoy this book."
657,Dara Megan,"Tak díky docela zvláštnímu začátku to na plný počet bodů není. Musím přiznat, že chvílemi mne štvala Rachel, nemám ráda až tak ""bezradné"" ženy, které se vrhají do sebezkázy.. Ale jinak příběh byl skvělý, od sté stránky jsem se opravdu bavila a knihu nechtěla dát z ruky. Více napíšu v recenzi na blogu, ale to až časem. :) teď nad tím musím ještě popřemýšlet :)"
658,Leslie Kay,"If you like thrillers, this one's a fast and fun read. I was hooked from ride one. It would be great to see as an Alfred Hitchcock movie. As always, I get tired of seeing the F-bomb tossed around.FYI: Lots of reviews are comparing this to Gone Girl, which I have to say that I bought and put down because of the nastiness. Yuck. My husband and I then bought it on audio to listen to on a drive... you'd think I would've learned the first time, but hearing it out loud was even worse than reading it. Nasty, Nasty, Nasty. Didn't even try for a 3rd time with the movie. "
659,Natalie (Natflix&Books),"I started listening to the audio of this two days ago during my commute. Yesterday, I swung by the library on my way home to snag the book because I didn't really plan on leaving my house too much over the weekend, but couldn't wait until Monday to continue listening. I finished it this afternoon, and really enjoyed it. I felt sorry for Rachel, and am always intrigued by unreliable narrators. I hated Anna and Tom (her ex-husband and the woman he left her for), and was curious to find out what had happened to Jess/Megan. I had my theories, but was still managed to be surprised by the ending. Full blog review to come. "
660,Kirsten (Kiki) Hollanders,Vanochtend vroeg heb ik deze spannende psychologische thriller uitgelezen. De karakters zijn allemaal zo prachtig uitgewerkt. Ik moet bekennen met iedereen is wel wat mis. Maar dat zorgde ervoor dat ik niet kon stoppen met lezen. Een eind wat ik zeker het overgrote deel van het boek niet heb zien aankomen. Absoluut een aanrader!
661,Jay,"이 책을 읽으면서 작년에 읽었던 "" Gone Girl "" 이라는 책이 자꾸 생각났다. 결혼한 여자의 입장에서 남편은 항상 무심하고 또 결국에는 바람을 피고. 여자는 그런 남자에게서 도망치고...이 책은 3명의 화자에 의해서 내용이 진행된다. 주인공인 Rachel은 남편과 이혼 이후에 우울증과 알콜 중독으로 인해서 직장도 없이 매일 매일 같은 기차를 타고 출퇴근을 반복하는 일상을 살아가는 여자이다.Magan은 Rachel 이 기차를 타고 지날때 보이는 집의 여주인이다. 과거의 상처에서 벗어나고 싶어하는 Magan은 어느날 사라진다.Anna는 Rachel의 전 남편인 Tom 과 새로 재혼안 여인이다. 새로 결혼한 행복한 삶에 Rachel이 술취한채로 전남편인 Tom에게 매달리는것이 불안하기만 한 여자이다.이 3여인의 입장에서 진행되는 스릴러 추리 소설이다."
662,Lafourche Library,"The Girl on the Train, the debut novel by Paula Hawkins is being compared to Gillian Flynn’s Gone girl. Just like Gone girl, the story moves fast and is compelling. Rachel, the main character of the book, becomes obsessed with a couple she observes on her daily train ride. Divorced for two years, she’s never gotten over this loss, so she creates a fantasy world around the couple whom she calls “Jason and Jess,” transferring the perfect married life she delusionally thinks she had onto them.13460996As fate would have it, Jess and Jason, whose names are really Megan and Scott, live a few doors down from the house Rachel once shared with her husband Tom. An alcoholic, Rachel also obsesses about Tom and his new Anna and their baby girl. During drunken stupors, she inserts herself into their lives on a regular basis and her compulsions set off a chain of tragic events.Paula Hawkins has written a gripping novel about memories, imagination, fantasy, truth and lies. Told in the alternating voices of Rachel, Megan and Anna, the story is revealed layer by layer as each character speaks what is her own truth.Like a Hitchcock thriller, The girl on the train grabs you from the first page. It has a believable surprise ending that won’t disappoint. It’s a fast, exciting read that you won’t want to put it down until you’re finished. Recommended.Review by Helen"
663,Wendy N,"The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins	“My mother used to tell me that I had an overactive imagination; Tom said that too. I can’t help it, I catch sight of these discarded scraps, a dirty T-shirt or a lonesome shoe, and all I can think of is the other shoe, and the feet that fitted into them.” 	On the outside, Rachel is a perfectly normal woman, but her life is profoundly messy – tangled in the muddle of her ex-husband who married off to another woman and stressing over the daily struggles of her insecurities. Everyday, Rachel takes the commuter train and scrutinizes her favorite track-sick house: number fifteen for, in this house, dwells “the perfect, golden couple” (Page 14). As time passes, she repeatedly sees the couple, or as she refers to as “Jess and Jason,” and becomes obsessive towards their relationship. She knows every intricate detail of the house, but more about the people inside it. She thought they were the perfect pair, or at least she did, until one day Jess, whose real name is Megan, goes missing. When Megan goes missing, Rachel couldn’t have been more a wreck. Rachel underwent a memory lapse due to the addiction of alcohol on the night that Megan went missing. In the beginning, Rachel convinces herself that her blackout is not tied to the disappearing of Megan; she believes that she is innocent. But is she? How can she be certainly sure of something that she has no memory of? The thriller is astoundingly developed, with numerous red herrings, twists, and turns. 	Seeing that as the novel is written in first person point of view, the readers have a reliable sense of what the characters are feeling which allows the readers to get lost and be part of the story itself. Refining the format of the novel, Paula Hawkins switches between the three characters’ points of view: Rachel, Megan, and Anna, the current wife of Rachel’s ex-husband. This enables the readers to distinguish the contrasting lives of these three women and how one sees the other as because they’re all acquaintances of one another. Paul Hawkins slowly intensifies the disappearance of Megan at a great pace as the story goes on. She turns Rachel, the obsessive stalker; to become seemingly involved in the case and gradually puts the pieces together. The way Rachel was described was fascinating. From the pathetic woman who lost her husband to another woman, she ends up showing persistence, and courage. "
664,Jan,"This was a compulsively readable novel about a woman who watches a married couple through the windows of her commuter train every day. She imagines their lives, as a way of taking her mind off her troubles--she has endured a painful divorce, lost her job and is drinking heavily. But her ""Rear Window"" obsession becomes real when the wife of the couple she fantasizes about is murdered."
665,Trixie Fontaine,"I wonder if I would have given this five stars if I hadn't been told by reviewers ""JUST LIKE GILLIAN FLYNN!"" Really NOT just like. Much more straightforward.Voyeurism, alcoholism, jealousy, guilt. And three women's perspectives."
666,April ,"I went into this book with a lot of cynicism (I guess?) because I'd read that it is comparable to Gone Girl and I actually never finished that book (I got to about 85% of the way through it and just... didn't finish it). However, I don't really have any particular reason I didn't finish Gone Girl -- I didn't like the characters but you're not supposed to like them.Anyway. Back to The Girl on the Train. I'm going to give you a one-word spoiler:(view spoiler)[GASLIGHTING. (hide spoiler)]Or at least, that was the main thought in my head, about 75% through the book.I can't really express why this book was so enjoyable to me. I think that for me, I liked Rachel a little more than I liked any of the characters in Gone Girl, and having that tiny bit of sympathy for her made reading the book easier (although there were still some cringeworthy parts in terms of her actions).It really is interesting, though, because it really does totally change your perception of people. I did guess the ""whodunit"" about 65 or 70% through it, but for me, it didn't ruin the story.The ending was pretty amazing in a creepy-as-shit way.The one thing I didn't really like was that at the beginning I got confused about who each of the 3 women were (Rachel, Anna, and Megan, although Anna didn't come into the story, in terms of having her own chapters, til later). But once that straightened itself out, the book sped along. I finished it in only a couple of days once I got started, and if I had had the time, it would've been finished in a few hours."
667,Jessie Wittman,"As a thriller/mystery, this book is fantastic! The way Hawkins weaves the three women's different stories, perspectives, and timelines together to steadily march the reader through the plot is almost mind-boggling in its complexities. I couldn't put the stinking thing down. It wasn't the most comfortable read for my tastes, I was a bit stressed, but I think that's just the nature of the genre, right? I enjoyed how Hawkins linked all the women to bearing life, to babies. That was a good thread. The train as a frame was a bit clunky and obvious, unless I'm missing some deeper meaning there. I suppose it did serve to show you how the women were different from each other. "
668,Catherine Hanley,"I really enjoyed this book more than Gone Girl, which it is constantly compared to. I hate the way Gone girl ends. This ending was better, I somehow did not see the twist coming at the end. The main character/narrator is constantly becoming hammered and ruining her life with embarrassing situations or lies. It's often uncomfortable and depressing, but you also find yourself relating to her, thinking of your most embarrassing nights out, and wanting her to have a victory, wanting her to solve this crime, no matter how Unhealthy her obsession is. When the crime is solved, you are still Unsatisfied at what a mess was made to everyone's life, but fulfilled by a good mystery solved, and resolution- so you def get mixed feelings- a good drunk buzz and a hangover. Crime mystery lovers will enjoy this novel. People that have never been black out drunk before might not. Can't wait to see the film. "
669,Kar,"y así sin mas llego... lo comencé a leer, seguí leyendo, continué y no se en que momento me percate que ya estaba por el final. Si bien no me sorprendió del todo, si fue mi cara de odio hacia Anna en un principio y mi cara de pobre chica a Rachel. Aún sigo sin comprender un poco la conducta de Anna, creo que la historia esta bien fundamentada y que mas que el hecho simple de una muerte, no es eso lo que te agarra al libro y te sostiene leyéndolo, no, creo que es el hecho de como carajos no recuerdas??!!!, creo que a todos nos ha pasado, es verdad, un suceso en la vida que tiene lagunas, esas lagunas son las que te aferran a el, te hacen devorarlo, estrujarlo y al final decir, BAM! AHI ESTA!. Muy buena estructura del libro a mi humilde punto de vista, recomendable para leer, pasar una tarde linda diciéndote a ti misma no es capaz y terminando por decir ahora entiendo por que es un numero uno del New York Times.Yo hubiera hecho lo mismo, aun no sé si lo haría por defensa o por enojo. ¿y tu?"
670,Chance Lee,"Because I start this review way off track (pun intended), I want to first say, The Girl on the Train is great. If you liked Gone Girl, read it. If you didn't like Gone Girl, read it. If you never read Gone Girl... well, you probably don't care about this subgenre of suspense novel, and this book won't change your mind. Now for a temporarily derailment (not sorry) before getting this train of thought going full-speed ahead. (Still not sorry.)The Girl on the Train is part of a disturbing trend in fiction. No, not the trend of terrible people doing terrible things while we're compelled to read their terrible actions, and, somewhat terribly, root for them. Yes, The Girl on the Train is exactly one of those books, but the trend I mean is the one in which these terrible women aren't women. They're ""girls."" Think Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Gone Girl. Lena Dunham's Not That Kind of Girl. (j/k, Lena, I love you.)I blame Stieg Larsson for popularizing this type of title. Or maybe it was Anne Frank. Anyway, it must be said, the fault of Larsson's title lies with his American translator. The American translator came up with the offensive English title that has been oft-copied. I found the sequel to The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo insanely problematic, but the initial book had its strengths, namely the character of Lisbeth Salander. The title demeans her, even before Larsson does in future books, by calling her a ""girl."" Since then, it seems like dozens of fictional women have been girled. It's disturbing, and not necessarily what the authors may have in mind. However, this review isn't about Stieg Larsson. Shame on me, taking a book about a ""girl"" and making it into a story about a man. The Girl on the Train makes you think it's going to do that too, but it doesn't. As I first read the book, I thought the title might be the result of the publisher, not necessarily author Paula Hawkins' fault. But then she has her main character, Rachel, refer to herself as ""the girl on the train."" Ugh, I thought. But then I realized that Rachel doesn't want to just be ""the girl"" on the train. She wants to matter. She's not sure how to do it (who among us is?), but she wants to make a difference somehow, to redeem herself and reclaim her agency, agency that a ""girl"" doesn't have. Hawkins doesn't use the same girl vs. woman language I used in my intro, but Rachel doesn't want to be a ""girl"" anymore, and the book explores what it means to be girled by -- surprise surprise -- emotionally abusive men. (Vague spoilery stuff ahead in my plot synopsis/analysis (synoplysis), but I never explicitly reveal who does what.)Rachel is our main character. She is also a drunk. (I'd be a drunk too if we had GIN AND TONIC IN A CAN in the U.S.) Rachel is a terrible, violent, black-out drunk. She is what you might call an ""unreliable narrator."" But you would be wrong. Rachel is actually flat-out honest with everyone. The problem is that her memories, because of her blackouts, are unreliable. It's a fine distinction. Many books mislead their readers with the lazy conceit of having a liar for a narrator (I'm looking at you, Gone Girl!). Rachel desperately wants to be honest, but she doesn't know how. Yes, unreliable memory is a conceit too, but the book actually addresses this, and the complex cause-and-effect of Rachel's alcoholism, directly, making it one of its themes. Like Rachel, Hawkins does it in a frank and honest way. When many of the ""girls"" in recent memory are manipulative liars, it's refreshing to see a woman struggling to be the opposite. Our other two narrators are Megan and Anna. I won't say too much about them, or their respective husband characters. Identities of all characters twist and swirl in a fascinating, organic way. We all make up stories about people, and what we make up is almost always wrong. Although Rachel is the most explicit one -- imagining a life of two complete strangers she sees from her train every day -- all the characters do it. They make assumptions, and more often than not they are way off base. Only when you stop speeding by, as if on a train, do you get to know someone... and you might regret that you did!As for technical stuff, the pacing is good. The symbolism is good and consistent (so many books I've recently read bring up an image or symbol only to drop it!) but complicated enough to not grow stale. We flip between the three narrators, with Rachel being almost ever odd-numbered chapter. The chapters get shorter and shorter as the book ramps up the pace toward the conclusion. Just when you're getting tired of all the sulking and confusion, the dominoes start to fall faster and faster. The three narrators are each interesting in their own way, and each one evokes different feelings. There is one brief segment at the end which is forced, in order to forward the plot. Two characters argue for two solid pages while a third watches. Then, the third is like, ""okay, distract so-and-so and I'll call the police!"" when s/he should have just called the police while they were arguing. But I forgive this because I like the writing style. Hawkins has a way of repeating herself that isn't repetition, it's parallelism. Her three narrators often have very similar thoughts, but from a slightly different angle. This isn't a first-time author mistake, making all of her characters sound the same. They sound the same, and think similar ways, because they are all very similar people. It makes sense -- because they are all being taken advantage of by the same man, a man who preys on this specific type of person. Only by seeing how similar they are, not how different they are, do we see the puzzle pieces fit together.The title, concept, and timing invite comparisons to Gone Girl, so, dammit, I'm going to compare it to Gone Girl, a book I thoroughly enjoyed. Train is mercifully shorter than Gone Girl. Train needs to be shorter because it doesn't have the same spark and wit and fun that Gone Girl does. But where Gillian Flynn spends most of her pages trying to trick her readers, Paula Hawkins is trying to trick her characters, thereby tricking us in the process (although early on she does get a little tricky with pronouns to build suspense in an annoying way). It's a subtle difference, but one that makes The Girl on the Train ultimately stronger than Gone Girl. Gone Girl may have the sizzle, but The Girl on the Train has more steak. Edit: I got a little over zealous with this one (I blame allergies), so I'm bringing it down to four stars. Still a good book, but only if you barrel through it to the end, which is an enjoyable fun ride. But going back through it, I don't find it as compelling. "
671,Mari Carmen,"Un libro con el que todos nos podemos sentir un poco identificados, a todos nos gusta en mayor o menor medida cotillear la vida de los demás.A nuestra protagonista demasiado.....sus buenas intenciones la meterán en más de un lío del que saldrá escaldada.Un buen final, consigue que todos conjeturemos el posible desenlace."
672,Tiny Shen,"Woww.. Unpredictable !!!Ga nyangka dengan endingnya.. Baru ""ngeh"" ketika mendekati ending.. Deritakan dengan 3 sudut pandang yang berbeda (Rachel, Megan dan Anna), dan 3 orang ini adalah orang yang paling dekat dengan pelakunya.. Rekomen... Ga sabar tunggu filmnya.."
673,Inês Beato,"Esta foi, sem a menor dúvida, uma leitura compulsiva! Consigo compreender o porquê de este thriller se ter tornado um fenómeno mundial: é rápido, viciante e surpreendente. Relativamente às personagens, são um ""bando de gente doida"", mas isso até contribui para tornar o livro mais perturbador. A história é contada a partir da visão de três personagens, que nos vão dando perspectivas distintas das mesmas situações. A partir de determinada altura começa-se a deslindar o que vai suceder, mas não deixa de ser cativante a quantidade de voltas que o enredo dá até ao final. É um livro simples, que se lê num ápice e que me manteve em pulgas página atrás de página, sempre com vontade de saber mais e ver até onde toda aquela loucura ia dar. O tom psicótico do livro fez-me lembrar ligeiramente a obra ""Gone Girl"" de Gillian Flynn, com a diferença que não fiquei com um sentimento de amor-ódio no final do livro de Paula Hawkins. Pontuação: 4.5/5"
674,Alisa,"This was an uniquely done murder/suspense story. What was different in this was that all three of the narrators are really unlikable people. Rachael is the primary narrator and she's a blackout alcoholic who lives in her own world making up stories as she goes along. She lies constantly and you're not always sure what the truth is in her part of the narration. The other two women have lesser narration time but they are not any better. They're selfish and unkind and one is an adultress. I know some people did not like this book because of the MC's but that's exactly why I liked it. It strayed from the traditional narrator being the ""good guy"". I thought it was creatively done and I enjoyed everything about the story. *I listened to this on audio and it was really well done but it takes a bit of getting used to as there are three different women telling the story.*"
675,RJ,"When was the last time I'd read a novel in two days? Fast paced, twists, red herrings. Not Gone Girl but with a lot of its devices; the casual releasing of information that jolts the reader. Someone lent this to me, I doubted I'd find it interesting. Wrong. But there are some messed up characters in this one, neurotic is a milder term I would use."
676,Shay,"I'm normally not a suspense reader or a reader of books that are overly hyped up. I haven't read Gone Girl which I've often seen it compared to. Now.... with that said, I couldn't wait to get to the end. I actually set the book down and paced around my living room a few times trying to wrap my head around some things. Poor, poor Rachel. My heart hurt for her. To be so broken, so sad and for everyone to think you're crazy. *semi spoiler* Anna was a BITCH. Even until the end! She seemed like a psychopath too, just ugh. I guessed it before I was half way through the book. At first I had a few theories but then I a few things kept pointing to ""it"". I don't like feeling scared when I read and this book allowed me to be pulled to the edge of my seat and intrigued. Do I think this is a literary work of art? Nah, but the ability to switch character POV that often and not leave the reader confused is worth 3 stars alone in my book. The believability in the characters added another star for me for a 4 star review."
677,Jaci,"This one kept me guessing. Great twists, unreliable narrators, and things that aren't what they appear to be. Switching between the characters needed some attention so as not to wander down the wrong path. Great read."
678,Damjan Zorc,"Britanska pisateljica je do leta 2015, ko ji je uspel veliki met z Dekletom na vlaku, pisala romance pod psevdonimom Amy Silver, vendar brez vidnega uspeha. Pisateljski poklic je nameravala obesiti na klin, saj je bila že skoraj brez prebite pare, vendar je še v zadnjem obupanem poskusu založbi poslala nedokončan rokopis temačnejšega, resnejšega romana. In potem se je vse skupaj začelo precej hitro odvijati. Knjiga se je – tudi po zaslugi hvalnic težkokategornikov, kot je Stephen King – hitro zavihtela na lestvice največjih uspešnic, do zdaj se je prodala v več milijonih izvodov, pognalo se je tudi kolesje Hollywooda. V naslednjem letu lahko pričakujemo priredbo romana z znanimi igralskimi imeni.Tisti klin bo očitno sameval še kar nekaj časa, saj pisateljica že piše naslednji roman, mračni psihološki triler, ki bo po napovedih ugledal luč knjigarn naslednje poletje.Roman Dekle na vlaku je napisan skozi oči treh žensk, vendar levji delež prvoosebne pripovedi pade na Rachel, travmatizirano, zapuščeno, osamljeno žensko. Ob točno določeni uri se je z vlakom vozila v službo in na tej poti je poznala vsak kamenček ob progi. Z velikim zanimanjem je opazovala ljudi, ki so posedali na vrtu in pisali življenjske zgodbe, o katerih je Rachel lahko samo ugibala. To ji je šlo dobro od rok. V glavi si je ustvarjala svoj pogled na resničnost, ki se je zrcalil skozi okno vlaka. Svoje neizživete sanje, svoj poteptani ponos, ki ga je v slehernem trenutku zalivala z dobršno mero alkohola, je projicirala na ljudi, ki so nemo švigali mimo njenih oči. Milni mehurček prijetnih trenutkov, topline, zgodbe, v kateri sta nastopala princ na belem konju in srčna dama, je napihnila okoli para, ki je živel v hiši ob progi.Vlak se je vsak dan, ob točno določeni uri, ustavil pri semaforju. Tu zraven sta na vrtu svojega doma pogosto posedala zakonca, ki sta živela svoje sanje. On je bil kljub svoji velikosti in robatosti pozoren, topel, kar je žena sprejemala z odprtimi rokami. Rachel je s svojimi mislimi vstopila v njun osebni prostor in jima izrisovala pot, po kateri sta stopala. Pot brez ovir, zavojev, klancev. Imela sta vse, kar je bilo njej vzeto. Bila sta njena sreča.Vsaj tako je bila trdno prepričana, dokler nekega dne ni opazila nečesa, kar jo je vrglo iz tira. Milni mehurček se je v hipu razblinil, tako hitro ji je spodneslo tla, da se je lahko oklenila edinega prijatelja, ki ga je še imela – alkohol. V časopisu je prebrala, da je Megan – ženska iz hiše, ki jo je tako rada opazovala – izginila. Ker se je v pijanskem deliriju na večer njenega izginotja motala prav v tem okolišu, saj je tu živel tudi njen bivši mož, je z grozo, ki jo je podžgalo še skeleče zavedanje, da se ne spominja prav ničesar, kar se je dogajalo tistega večera, pomislila, da je povezana z izginotjem. Kaj se je pravzaprav zgodilo? In kaj, za vraga, je storila?Že na uvodnih straneh je zgodba zakoličena s številnimi vprašanji in zapleti, ki se z ravno prav odmerjenim tempom odmotajo do zadnje strani. Dogodek, ki sproži nov dogodek, se kot snežna kepa odvali po življenjih vpletenih in nase lepi grozljive spomine, potlačene travme in zbije maske z ljudi, ki so še do včeraj poosebljali zaupanje. Snežno bela kepa slej ko prej pride do umazane, razmočene, blatne zemlje. In ko enkrat izruva tudi korenine, ni poti nazaj.Na površju gre za klasični kriminalni triler, ki se v svojem drobovju loti temeljnega vprašanja iskrenosti in laži. Incident, ki na zunaj zamaje družbo, daleč od naslovnic in javnih polemik razcepi bistvo zakonskih odnosov. Prvoosebna pripoved treh žensk je ves čas subjektivna ter prav zaradi tega neposredna, brutalna, kruta, na trenutke že kar odbijajoča, saj avtorica predstavi enosmerni in dvodimenzionalni pogled na žensko vlogo v odnosu, kar bi znalo razkačiti marsikaterega bralca. V pisateljičini domišljiji ženski prostor v družbi namreč določajo samozavestni, krepostni moški, ki se brez večjih težav polastijo ženskih misli in jih usmerijo proti njim samim. Ideal ljubezni, ki si ga trije glavni ženski liki pričarajo na izkrivljenih podobah, pa se razbije na lastnih dvomih in razklanih sanjah iz preteklosti. Iz tega pa se ne more roditi nič prijetnega. Kljub tehtnim pomislekom, da se avtorica teme loti preveč lahkotno in da vzbuja vtis, kot da globoko v sebi sovraži ženske, pa je bil njen namen vendarle prikazati svet, ki se odvija za zaprtimi vrati, stran od oči, ki vidijo samo popolno zunanjost brez razpok. In ravno iz tega je mogoče razbrati kritiko družbe, v kateri je ultimativni cilj vzdrževanje neizmerne, vseobsegajoče sreče. Vedno in povsod. Ne glede na vse. Konec koncev pa ne gre pozabiti, da gre v prvi vrsti za žanrski roman, ki vendarle doseže svoj cilj.Vsi ljubitelji žanra bodo prišli na svoj račun, saj zgodba vleče in se bere hitro. Čeprav so v njej vidne jasne sledi avtorice, ki je svoj slog brusila z ljubezenskimi romani, in kljub temu, da je glavnega negativca mogoče uganiti precej pred zadnjo stranjo, zaradi česar konec izgubi nekaj smrtonosnega naboja, knjiga ne razočara. Samo ne smeš imeti previsokih pričakovanj. Zgodba je temačna, vendar kljub temu zabava.Objavljeno na damjanzorc.net."
679,Kaitlin,Highly recommend this book if you liked Gone Girl; not as good (but pretty close!) It has similar concepts and definitely keep you guessing.
680,Rachel Green,"First of all - Rachel. Girl. There are many apps that won't let you drunk text or email. Why your friends - well, acquaintances, really, didn't tell you about them is a mystery unto itself. Now on to the actual review. This was an online book club read for September that I breezed through - it's an easy read, and I spent quite a bit of time at the airport and on planes for the holiday weekend, so I finished this a lot faster than I expected. I haven't read Gone Girl, so I wasn't familiar with the narration style, but that made it all the more interesting to me. In fact, I would argue that one of the things I loved about this book was the narration and plot style. See, I'm the type of person who reads the final conclusion of a mystery, because to me, the final conclusion itself isn't the most interesting part - it's how you get to that point. So, this was especially interesting to me because we knew, for the most part, how the story ended - a lot of the book was really about piecing together how the story got to that point in the first place, both by revealing what happened in the past as well as the current events that reflected what happened in the past.I do have to say that the last twist wasn't as shocking as the book jacket made it out to be, IMO. An interesting twist, maybe, but I think there was more than enough foreshadowing to keep it from being completely shocking. Your mileage may vary though.But yeah, this is a good read. Recommend it to anyone that likes a good mystery and/or is maybe a little bit nosy."
681,Lisa B.,Whew - what a heart pounding suspense story! 
682,Bernadette,"This novel is pure, thriller entertainment that kept me guessing at the end of nearly every chapter. The plot centers on Rachel, a divorced alcoholic who refuses to accept that her marriage is over. While riding the London commuter train daily she spies on a couple in her former neighborhood; she fantasizes that they lead the ideal life she has lost. Another neighbor, Megan, goes missing and Rachel, in a drunken stupor, thinks she may have witnessed or participated somehow in the disappearance. I found the telling of the story from the viewpoints of the three women, Rachel, Megan and Anna, a bit confusing at times, but the technique enables the reader to get inside the heads of these women as they find that appearances and reality are rarely the same. A great summer read; be sure you have nothing pressing to do because you will have a tough time putting this book down."
683,Catarina Marques,Gostei da forma como livro está escrito. Mas é um tanto previsível.
684,Aditya Lotia,This is my first crime thriller of the year and it blew me away. I had no idea what the book is about when I had picked it up and until about half the book I was still at loss as to where exactly is the story heading. But was it a ride after! I loved all the characters mainly because everyone in the book has shades of gray and that is how real characters are supposed to be. The emotions were real and took their time to settle in and yet the story was fast paced. Definitely recommend.
685,Aliaa Mohamed,حسنًا حان وقت أن ألتقط أنفاسي وأعيد الهدوء إلىًّ بعد تلك الرحلة المتعبة المليئة بالغموض والبحث والشكوك ..في البداية ، عليك عزيزي القاريء الانتباه قبل قراءة تلك الرواية إلى عدة أشياء ، أولها أن الرواية ليست رومانسية أو دراما عكس ما يوحي اسمها ، فهى رواية تنتمي إلى الفئة البوليسية ، فئة الجرائم والخيوط المتشابكة .ثاني تلك الأشياء هو أن تلك الرواية ستجعلك متسمرًا أمامها ساعات طويلة دون ملل ، ومن ثم عليك أن تنتهي من مشاغلك وتجعل نفسك أسيرًا لهذا العمل دون سواه ..في أولى الصفحات ، ستجد نفسك لا تستوعب ما يحدث ، وستجد نفسك تتساءل من هؤلاء ؟ وما العلاقة بينهم ؟ ولكنها البداية فقط ، عليك أن تمسك بالخيوط البدائية وبعد ذلك أترك نفسك تمامًا دون التفكير في شيء ، ستجد أن الأحداث المتتالية والمتعاقبة أداة جذب لا يمكنك التغاضي عنها ..لا توجد شخصية رئيسية في تلك الرواية ، جميع الشخصيات الواردة لهم أدوار محورية ، ريتشيل توم آنا سكوت ميغيان كمال آبديك ، ولكن يمكن القول أن القطار هو سيد الموقف هنا في تلك الرواية ، فمن خلاله تبدأ الأحداث وتتطور ولولاه لما وجدت الحبكة أو وسيلة تصاعد الأمور ..رغم أن تسلسل الأحداث داخل الرواية والانتقال من الماضي إلى الحاضر والعكس هو أمر مرهق إلا أن ذلك أضفى المزيد من الإثارة والتشويق داخل تلك الرواية دون العمل على حرق الأحداث ، بالعكس تجعل الأمر وكأنه أشبه بفسيفساء تتضح معالمها كلما تكاملت مكوناتها ..الترجمة ؟ لا غبار عليها ، ولم أشعر وكأنني أمام عمل مترجم من الأصل ..أسلوب المعالجة ممتاز ، الحبكة الدرامية ممتازة ، الكاتبة نجحت في استغلال كافة مقومات الكتابة الناجحة وأخرجت لنا عملًا مميزًا خاصة وأنني لا أميل إلى فئة الروايات البوليسية ولكن الأمر أختلف هنا ..ملحوظة أخيرة : عندما نظرت إلى صورة الكاتبة في نهاية تلك الرواية شعرت وكأنها قاتلة ! يبدو أن الرواية كان لها تأثيرًا لا يُستهان به عليًّ ..
686,Estações Literárias,"3,5Bom, mas previsível! Penso que melhor livro do ano terá sido do hype que foi as vendas..."
687,Ngin Rui,"It seems like every psychological thriller book involved disturbed women nowadays is grouped as “the next Gone Girl”. Is Gone Girl has become a genre instead a book? I set my expectation high in The Girl on the Train with hoping that this book would be twisted and mindfuck as Gone Girl. Apparently, the only same with Gone Girl is, Megan is the missing wife and Scott, the husband is the suspect of Megan disappearing. Other than that, nothing can be compared to Gone Girl. This book is written in a diary form. It feels like you are reading someone’s diary that you found from behind the closet. The characters in this book are totally hot mess and very terrible person. I do not feel pity to any of the characters. I can bet you won’t be able to find your favorite character in this book at all. This book is written in 3 different POVs from 3 different women and somehow they are actually connected with each other. How many of us actually can tell lies without being caught? I bet most of us know how to tell a good lies. Everyone is lying in this book. Even the memory inside the head can tell lies. Indeed, The Girl on the Train brought out a lot of women’s issues in relationship such as infidelity, unhappy marriage, insecurity, vulnerability and etc related to women and relationship. And men are the starter. Women are traditionally to be blamed for everything when a relationship goes wrong. The ending is good because it gives the readers a closure like what women need when a relationship ended is a closure so they can move on with their life. I do enjoy this book because of the suspense elements and the darkness vibe I feel throughout the book. 3.5 stars. "
688,Bhavik,"4.5 starsI hated every character in this book. Every single character was detestable for their own significant reasons from Scott to all three of our main character's. But that's also the reason I so throughly enjoyed this book. The hatred I had towards a lot of these characters wasn't because they were badly written characters, it was because they were characters that did terrible things and Paula Hawkins had created them in a way that meant I had to hate them. Every character has a complex backstory and the way the story unfolds is so applaudable as we slowly get little pieces of information about each character along the way. Emotions play a big part of this book and the manipulation of them. Rachel is an alcoholic and even though watching her relapse time and time again was frustrating it was also completely immersing and interesting, these scenes were so insightful into her reactions and how she acted during these time periods. The twisted nature of every character's emotions had me completely hooked and I adored every part of being inside Rachel's insane mind. (view spoiler)[Okay, here goes what I thought of the actual plot. I didn't guess the murderer at all. In fact, I guessed everyone BUT Tom and I guess that was because we didn't know how well Tom and Megan knew each other until the final mystery-unfolding chapters of the book. I KNEW for sure that Kamal wasn't the killer though but I was totally second-guessing myself on Scott when he went psycho and locked up Rachel. The way the plot unravelled with switching dates and narratives was clever, complex and smooth that it almost makes me want to pick up Gone Girl despite the fact I've already been spoiled. I adored the way this was setup and planned by the author and I can see how well constructed this has been. I'll most assuredly be reading anything else Paula Hawkins comes out with in the future.  (hide spoiler)]"
689,Kristin Vaskie,"It took a while at the beginning to get me really interested but once it did I could not put it down. I finished this in one day and would probably read it again just to see if I missed anything. Definitely read this book if you like a good psychological thriller and mystery, it will keep you guessing about what happened to Rachel and Megan, I must have had at least five theories until I figured it out. I won't spoil anything, just pick up the book and read it, it's worth it!"
690,Edward Terblanche,"While deciding whether I should purchase this book or not I came very close to giving it pass mainly due to the fact that I was seeing a large number of people giving the book a bad rating, citing reasons such as the fact that the characters are unlikable and the story line dull. I couldn't be happier that I decided to give it a go!! The characters are in my opinion what makes this book great, the book revolves mainly around the lives of Megan, Rachel and Anna, all of them being a special kind of messed up and definitely not the type of people that you would like to have in your life. While theses characters might not be your run of the mill ""good guy"", ""bad guy"" (or girl in this instance) together with a person that gets thrown into the mix to be a bit of a diversion, they feel real, we all have problems and secrets and some of us handle or suppress it better than others. The story line evolves quick enough to ensure that you are not bored for a single moment and while it lets slip a few clues which suggest what is actually going on you can never be certain until the end when things unravel fairly rapidly and even though you might have figured one or two things out along the way there will be a surprise or two waiting for you, albeit dark ones. I haven't read ""Gone Girl"" so I can unfortunately not draw that analogy but what I can tell you is that this is a spectacular read that will keep you tapping your kindle's screen without the slightest feeling of duress. "
691,J.A. McLachlan,"This is a quick read, and thoroughly engrossing. Hawkins does an excellent job of portraying an alcoholic in a sympathetic but unsparing way, and a brilliant job of using the unreliable narrator. It's all too easy to lose the reader with a narrator so unbelievable in chronicling the events that the reader has no idea what to believe, if anything, but Hawkins manages to reel us in nonetheless, as we struggle along with Rachel to sort out truth from alcoholic hallucinations and blackouts, in this captivating page-turner. I don't even like mysteries usually, but it was painful to put this one down. A good job, also, of showing the gradual healing of the main character. I have to admit, though, that much as I was rooting for Rachel to heal, she was much less interesting a character sober than drunk, and as her narration of events became more sober, and therefore more reliable, the intrigue subsided. I knew the ending well ahead, it was no revelation, hence the 4 stars rather than 5, but it was a believable ending. Well done."
692,Deborah,"This seemed to be an upcoming hot book and was pushed on me by some combination of the NYT and HuffPo. While it was compared in some of the blurbs I read to Gone Girl, it really has a different feel (and different resolution) than that book -- it's more of a straightforward mystery/suspense novel. It is told from three perspectives -- Rachel, the central narrator, who is a divorced alcoholic living a frustrating life; Anna, the woman her husband left her for, who is now the mother of his child; and Megan, who Rachel has been seeing from the train every day as she comes home to her London suburb, whom Rachel has dubbed ""Jess"" and who goes missing early in the book. What Rachel knows about Jess and about her disappearance is unclear to Rachel, as her alcoholism blanks her memory; how these characters fit together is revealed a decent distance through the book, although I found the twists related to those revelations to be foreseeable. I enjoyed this as a read -- Rachel is interesting, and the ways in which her alcoholism alter her perceptions make it so that it isn't clear throughout what has really happened to her -- even if the cause of Megan's disappearance is one you may see coming."
693,Carolina,"Gosto de ir às escuras para os livros, mas neste soube-me ainda melhor. A história é-nos contada através de três pontos de vista, mas é difícil confiar neles, pois as três personagens têm problemas, ainda que cada uma à sua maneira. O facto de estarmos constantemente a alterar entre narrativas e personagens torna a história dinâmica, mas para mim, é a escrita da autora o ponto forte do livro. Muito misteriosa, objetiva e simples, dá-nos informações e descreve detalhes de forma realista, como se fossemos nós próprios a personagem desta história. Conta-nos pormenores que nos fazem pôr em causa tudo e todos. Neste livro, nada nem ninguém é o que aparenta ser. O final não foi surpreendente e por isso perdeu uma estrela. Já a meio do livro tinha algumas desconfianças sobre certa personagem, mas ainda assim acho que a autora conseguiu criar um desfecho plausível. Um livro não é só o final, é muito mais do que isso, e este livro prendeu-me do início ao fim, sempre na tentativa de tentar perceber afinal o que se estava a passar. Recomendo imenso e é, sem dúvida, um dos melhores livros que li este ano."
694,Stephanie Lynn,"My recent selection of books has tended to be non-fictional stories set in various war periods. As you would expect, they have been “heavy” books that, while I enjoyed very much, will elicit many emotional responses and empathy towards those less fortunate described both in the book as well as others who lived through these times. Girl on The Train was a nice break from that. But don’t let that fool you. This easy-to-read story of a girl on a train immersing herself into a murder investigation yet finding herself to have been already immersed can still elicit many emotional responses although they are much more inward facing.On some level we all can relate to Rachel, whether we admit it or not. Rachel, a young divorced woman finds herself dealt a bad hand over the past few years and is in a state of sorrow and depression, whether she realizes it or not. She takes the train to and from “work” every day looking out the window and at the houses she passes. Throughout her many trips past the same houses each morning and evening, she invents her own story of the people who live in the houses even naming them. This is one of the areas that I think that we can all relate to on some level but may not be eager to admit it. I daydream. Often. I don’t daydream about ways that my life can necessarily be different nor do I long for that, but just an alternate world that I made up. Like Rachel. Doesn’t everyone? Well if not everyone, at least avid readers who are probably reading this – living, at times, in an outside reality, or at least imagining living in an outside reality. I like my life but I also like my outside reality. It’s just a parallel. I’m not giving too much away with the next topic but the entire subject of divorce is one that I just cannot understand. I grew up in a Catholic family where people just didn’t get divorced. Grandparents, aunts, uncles, my parents – none divorced. It shocks me not simply that people get divorced or how many people get divorced but that at one point in time you married that person. At one point in time you were head over heels in love with that person, missed him, trusted him, saw yourself spending the rest of your life with him. How can a couple go from this to, yes, divorce, but what about bitter divorce? Rachel says it best:“He smiles – that wide, beautiful smile that used to make me melt – and I start to sob. I can’t believe it, can’t believe we are brought to this, that the greatest happiness I have ever known – my life with him – was an illusion.”If you read the book you know what “illusion” she is talking about but is this “illusion” true for all couples who end in that bitter divorce? Well, that scares me. I have a perfect and happy marriage going on 5 years and can never ever imagine hating my dear husband as many divorcees do. But they probably did not think that either until, well, they did. Those were just two things that stuck with me from this book. It is a quick read and a good story. The characters are developed well and enough for the short length of the book. Being a huge fan of Gone Girl, I have to say it doesn’t compare, but it’s still good! Give it a read! **Spoiler**When did you realize who the killer was? I tend to be very gullible in books so wonder when others catch on. I realized in the chapter when Anna found the cell phone."
695,Ruth,The first 100 pages were a little slow and at one point I wanted to give the main character a quick kick in the pants and tell her to just get herself to AA. But I kept reading and I'm glad I did. Like the perfect summer blockbuster movie this book will not win any awards but that does not make it unworthy of the praise and it's position on the top of the bestseller list. I try not to think ahead too much when reading mysteries or thrillers and just enjoy the ride and it was definitely a good one.
696,Elizabeth,"I listened to this book on a short road trip. Full of suspense, Paula Hawkins kept me enthralled during the 11-hour journey. Read it!"
697,Antonio Buainain,"An exciting journey with the girl on the trainVery well composed, creative and far way the dominant easy plots we come across in most best seller. The story, told by 3 women, unfolds with a lot of twists and surprises, and after the middle of the book I doubt if anyone can drop it before reaching the end of the story. Acabei de ler The Girl on the Train: A Novel e o pontuei com 4 estrelas. Não conhecia a autora. Uma grata surpresa. Recomendo fortemente para quem gosta de um bom thriller psicológico. Os personagens têm conteúdo, são bem delineados e pensam. O plot é rico, complexo, claro e muito bem construído e costurado."
698,Joy,This really kept my interest. I liked the multitude of perspectives and the psychological layers. 
699,SuperWendy,"This has gotten a lot of comparisons to Gone Girl. It's kind of like Gone Girl in the respect that it has nothing good to say about marriage and that every single character is completely unlikeable. That said, I did end up liking this quite a bit but am really happy I listened to it on audio. I prefer my suspense novels to be ""fast-paced"" and the early chapters were slow going for me. Narration was very good (three narrators!), and the slow build to the suspense had me riveted by the time I got to the final couple of CDs. How this book isn't like Gone Girl? The ending of this one doesn't suck. I did see the whodunit coming, but the dramatic denouement was great. Enjoyable listen."
700,Theresa,"Loved it as I knew I would! Did not see ""who done it"" at all!! Great ending.... Almost could not put it down. A hint of Hitchcock in this book."
701,Carrie Robinson,"It was pretty good. I liked the ending, I didn't see it coming. But I did think it had some slow parts. And in the beginning it was a bit confusing who was talking, I didn't realize each chapter was a different person. Maybe that was just me... "
702,Joe,Lives up to the hype. 4.5 stars. 
703,Maureen,"HauntingI had read a couple of bad reviews, so I avoided this book. Do yourself a favor, ignore the bad reviews and read it. The Girl on the Train is a thriller, which will leave you breathless in the final moments. "
704,Josie,"I really didn't want to like this, and I didn't....I loved it!By rule, I read books that fly under the radar somewhat, and because this book has been so in your face it actually put me off wanting to read it.But succumb I did, and I am glad I did. Firstly I think a huge plus was that I have been in London, I've sat on the trains, I've looked out the windows and seen snippets of people's lives....so it was easy to visualise the train, the houses, even the streets and the people.The characters were really well formed. I'm a fan of an author who uses the the right amount of characters and uses them all, rather than you wondering ""what the hell is he doing in here"" with regards to under-formed characters.The prize for cliff hangers, this author is a serious contender! Totally left hanging at the end of each chapter.I just really really enjoyed it. Great debut and I look forward to more from this author as I am sure she has received a heafty advance already for a second novel.Could you spot the twist with a 100 pages to go? Yes you could. But you were never too sure were you!"
705,John Woodhouse,"After a short period of not reading because I've been so busy, I felt practically malnourished and starved of wordy garnishments. I was in need of something quick and meaty and bad for you, like the morning after the night before when you crave macdonalds. Girl on a train over delivered. More like a gourmet burger, It oozed with calorific characters which I could not gobble up quick enough. The story kicked along at a pace of an inter city and the rumble on the tracks was palpable too. To get an undiluted taste of the real and disturbed lives and minds of those visually 'Normalish' people was refeshing. To be honest I can't decide if the disappointment I felt towards the too cheesy final line was due to the malfitting flavour or just that I realised the meal was over. Yes there were a couple of extra gherkins hidden under the bun which were unneeded and unasked for like the authors over obsession with the term intolerable but over all it was well written and kept me well satiated throughout. So often I find a good thriller is spoilt by the logical sleuth thought processes of the narrating investigating plod, I greedily slumped down the thick milkshake of the irrational idiosyncratic viewpoint of Rachel, quenched my misery quota from Megan and frothed at the mouth with Tom, Scott and Anna. It might not be Michelin starred but still I felt it was a masticatory masterpiece which hit the spot as a sumptuous snack between meals."
706,Noshin Saiyaara,"This book was absolutely 100% realistic fiction. There was nothing about the plot that wasn't unimaginable, everything makes sense and fits right into place. The main character, Rachel, doesn't have a fairytale-like life, with love and beauty and all of the clichés of a romance book. She has faced so many hardships, and even the end, though happy, leaves her scarred. I recommend this to anyone who is sick and tired of books that are too sweet and want to read something that will make their throats dry and their heartbeats accelerate. "
707,Alexandra Davis,"Not going to lie, I got really wrapped up in this book and had trouble sleeping in my apartment alone. It's a goodie. "
708,Sherri F.,"I enjoyed this audiobook, but if you are a multi-task listener then either read the book or save this one for when you can concentrate (maybe driving or resting vs. cleaning, being online, paying bills, etc.). Also, many people have compared it to Gone Girl--for me it had some style similarities, but it really ended there. I only so-so liked GG but liked this one so much more--possibly b/c (1) I liked the ending & resolution (and that there even was one) and (2) I could relate to Rachel (addiction/recovery, ex-issues [not same as hers & I have 2], and rode the train to/fr work for 16 yrs).The characters are realistic--I've come across ppl like most of the characters & I'm sure many others have too and, yes like some ppl have noted, ""a hot mess"" (but there are a lot of hot messes out there & I used to be one on a tamer level)--but that's what makes it...idk what...maybe creepy, troublesome, relatable. Not to mention it's a debut book, can only imagine what else she has in store [unless a one hit wonder].As for describing it, can't add much more than description above other than maybe to say (that I don't think it mentions) the ""girl"" riding the train is trying to stop drinking & her flashbacks include drunkenness & blackouts AND she used to live on the street where the couple she watches does (but I don't think they lived there at the time).It's worth a try and if it's not your thing then don't finish it or finish it and then you have one more thing to complain about! :)"
709,Valerie,Loved the book. I didn't want it to end. 
710,Babus Ahmed,"I would award this book 3.5 stars, if the system would allow it. ""You don't know her. But she knows you."" Rachel is having a tough time, she's lost her marriage and her job and is a very heavy drinker. Her ex-husband Tom now lives in their old marital home with his new wife, Anna and their daughter. Rachel is living with an old friend from university, but has not told her she is unemployed and keeps up the ruse of commuting to work. Her commute is where this story starts as Rachel passes her old home every day on the train she becomes a voyeur and feels she knows something, hurried in her memory when a local woman goes missing.I cannot fault the way this story was told the narrative and characterisation were exemplary, I did find it somewhat predictable and so the conclusion lacked the wow factor for me. The Story is told very cleverly from the point of view of three female characters, Anna, Rachel and Megan, I loved how the story slotted together when told from these three different points of view. However, there was one thing that kept bothering me about the story and it was simply this: Rachel's inebriated memory ""blackouts"" leave her clueless, however after an extended period of time those memories become more prominent and real to her? This simple premise made no sense to me. None of us remember better later, memories do not work that way. A good thriller, but predictable and spoilt, for me personally, due to a big plot hole."
711,Mike Briley,"This is a difficult book to review. I found it fascinating but very depressing. This must be the first book I've read where there is not a single pleasant (sympathique in French) character. I had to keep reminding myself that this is fiction and that although people like this probably, certainly, exist in real life they are few and far between and do not make up 100% of the population as in this book. I found the book difficult to read with the alternating multiple first person accounts and a mixed-up chronology. Nevertheless I couldn't put it down. I'm ashamed to say that I had this morbid fascination for these self destructive psychotic characters, hoping against hope that one of them would show someIt is a not book I would recommend to anyone who is feeling down. It should in fact have a ""black box warning"" on it as do dangerous drugs and those that can lead to suicidal thought and actions!I've heard that Spielberg has bought the film rights - I am certainly not going to see the film although I am curious to see if he can resist making any of the characters just a bit ""sympathique""."
712,Christian Ross,"Very much enjoyed this book, some parts could have went a bit faster but there was a great plot twists. I listened via Audible so I think hearing it made the main character even more annoying but I am sure anyone that you listen to that has an addiction would be equally annoying. Overall a great listen/read. I would recommend to anyone who wants a story that has mystery, murder, mayhem and some drama!"
713,Nivaria Ramirez,"Un thriller para cautivar a cualquiera. Fantástica trama, difícil de descifrar hasta más de la mitad del libro, al menos para mi. Suena un poco raro que sea una mujer la autora de un libro tan ""masculino"". Esto demuestra el potencial de las personas, capaces de realizar todo aquello que se propongan, entre ellas, Rachel."
714,Mariel,"I read this in one sitting! While I was worried that the premise was too much like Gone Girl, there were enough twists and turns to keep me hooked. Great read, fast and entertaining! "
715,Mike Van Barneveld,"Iedere werkdag is het hetzelfde ritueel. ‘s Morgens op tijd je bed uit om de trein te halen die je naar je werk zal brengen, en aan het eind van de dag met dezelfde trein weer terug naar het punt waar je eerder die dag vandaan kwam. Ditzelfde ritueel heeft Rachel. De trein komt vlak langs het huis waar ze lange tijd samen met haar, inmiddels ex-, vriend heeft gewoond. Ze wil elke dag op dezelfde plek in de trein zitten, zodat ze er even naar kan kijken en kan dagdromen naar mooier tijden in haar leven. Tijden voordat haar vriend haar van de een op de andere dag verliet voor een andere vrouw en voordat ze hierdoor in een depressie raakte. Elke dag hetzelfde beeld dat aan haar ogen voorbijtrekt. Tot op een gegeven moment er iets merkwaardigs plaatsvindt. De buurvrouw Jess van een aantal huizen verder kust ‘s morgens niet haar man gedag om hem een leuke dag te wensen, maar is een innige omhelzing met iemand anders. Is Rachel hier getuige van een geheime liefdesaffaire?Helemaal spannend wordt het als deze zelfde vrouw ineens van de aardbodem verdwenen is. Het ergste wordt gevreesd, maar zolang deze vrouw niet gevonden wordt blijft alles mogelijk. Rachel leeft zelf in een schijnwereld, zo blijkt al snel. Ze probeert het werkelijke leven te ontvluchten door veel te drinken. Ze woont inmiddels op een kamer in huis bij een van haar vriendinnen en probeert naar anderen toe de schijn op te houden dat ze een geweldig leven heeft. Niks blijkt echter minder waar. Door haar overmatige drank inname herinnert ze zich dingen levendig die niet echt gebeurd zijn en kan ze zich juist die dingen die wel echt gebeurd zijn niet meer herinneren of heel vaag. Als de bewijzen dat Rachel iets met de verdwijning van de vrouw te maken heeft een steeds hardere vorm aannemen, wordt het Rachel toch wel erg heet onder de voeten. Als ze uiteindelijk naar de politie gaat om haar verhaal te doen, raakt ze verstrikt in haar eigen leugens en wordt ze niet meer serieus genomen. Maar heeft ze nou wel of niet iets met de verdwijning te maken?Het meisje in de trein leest als een… Nee, dat is te makkelijk hé. Het boek leest erg makkelijk weg. Eigenlijk direct al vanaf het begin zit je direct midden in het verhaal. Zoals een trein betaamt, neemt hij je direct mee op het moment dat je er in zit. Er is eigenlijk sprake van een heel kort beginstukje want de trein dendert in rap tempo voort. Het verhaal wordt verteld door Rachel, de hoofdpersoon. Je beleeft haar dagelijkse tochtjes alsof je er zelf bij aanwezig bent. Zoals vermeld wordt deze dagelijkse sleur als snel verbroken door… Ja waardoor eigenlijk. Zijn het hersenspinsels van Rachel of is er meer aan de hand. Het verhaal laat je als lezer lange tijd in het ongewisse. Je leert de levens van de hoofdpersonen steeds beter kennen en ook hoe ze met elkaar samenhangen. Naast Rachel zijn er nog vier karakters die een belangrijke rol spelen in dit verhaal. Al lezende wordt steeds duidelijker dat ze allemaal een masker lijken te dragen en niet (echt) zijn wie ze naar de buitenwereld beweren te zijn.Je zou de opbouw van de spanning kunnen vergelijken met een aflevering van Baantjer waar de hele tijd de gedachte boven je hoofd hangt dat er ieder ogenblik een flinke twist in het verhaal kan komen. Lowietje maakt ineens een opmerking waardoor alle verdenkingen ineens op iemand komen te liggen die vooraf niet verdacht was. Deze vorm van verdachtmaking spreekt mij wel aan en houd je als lezer dicht bij het verhaal betrokken. Paula Hawkins heeft voor bijna alle karakters toch een soort ‘jack-in-the-box’ moment gemaakt, waarin ze allemaal iets op moeten biechten. Aan het einde van het boek zijn alle karakters duidelijk uitgewerkt en is het overgrote deel van de onduidelijkheden die je aan het begin en tijdens het lezen zou kunnen hebben gekregen weggewerkt. Is de relatie tussen de ex-vriend van rachel en zijn nieuwe vriendin wel echt zo rooskleurig als Rachel denkt, is de psycholoog van Rachel wel zo integer als hij beweerd te zijn en wie is toch die vrouw Jess die plotseling verdwenen is? Heel subtiel wordt uit de doeken gedaan wat er zich nu werkelijk allemaal heeft afgespeeld de nacht dat de vrouw verdween en wie ervoor verantwoordelijk is. Heel origineel is het niet, maar de manier van vertellen daarentegen weer wel. Als lezer word je namelijk zelf ook beïnvloed door het vertekende beeld dat Rachel heeft op de wereld als gevolg van de alcohol.Het meisje in de trein is door de VN Thrillergids verkozen tot dé thriller van het jaar 2015. Dat Paula Hawkins een heel uniek geschreven verhaal heeft neergezet is overduidelijk. Dat we in de toekomst meer van haar zullen gaan horen (of lezen) is ook geen twijfel, alleen of dit nou echt het allerbeste spannende verhaal is van het afgelopen jaar daar valt zeer over te twijfelen? Het is een lekker boek om te lezen, maar onderscheid zich toch niet op een heel positieve manier echt van andere thrillers. Doordat de verwachting vooraf erg hoog was, viel het boek toch een beetje tegen. Het boek schommelt een beetje tussen de drie en de vier sterren als het gaat om spanning en originaliteit. Omdat de schrijfstijl goed is en het hier gaat om een debuut krijgt ze toch het voordeel van de twijfel. Vandaar een matige 4 sterren voor ‘Het meisje in de trein’."
716,Judy,Psychological thriller keeps you guessing. Real page turner. 
717,Varsha Dixit,"Very nice The book started great and continued till the last word. A well crafted story, a riveting read. The characters were very well etched."
718,Elle Cunningham,"Wow. This book gripped me from the start & I couldn't stop thinking about it throughout.Highly recommended by both friends, family & online- really enjoyable, thrilling & not too obvious.The characters are flawed, much like those in Gone Girl but I found myself caring about them in a very unusual way.Kept me interested. Well written & I would recommend to others."
719,Christine Hajzak,Great narration on audio book. An easy listen with interesting plot
720,Zézinha Rosado,"Comecei a ler este livro por insistência da minha filha, que o tinha lido e tinha achado fantástico mas que, no entanto, me fez a seguinte recomendação: ""nas primeiras 100 páginas não vais achar nada de especial...""Confirmo!! Realmente achei o primeiro terço do livro um pouco enfadonho e confuso, ainda para mais que a história tem 3 narradoras: Rachel, Anna e Megan.Mas à medida que a história avança e vamos conhecendo melhor as personagens nunca mais conseguimos largar o livro, e a cada capítulo que passa vamos desconfiando de uma pessoa diferente.Muita boa leitura para quem gosta de thrillers psicológicos."
721,Dawn Talley,"I enjoyed this read and found myself eager to figure out what was going on. I don't think any of the characters were terribly likable, which makes it a challenge to feel invested. I did like the book and enjoyed the descriptive imagery. "
722,Erin,"The cover copy makes this sound like Rear Window, and there are definitely nods to that movie in the book, but it is so much more than that - it owes a lot to the play and film Gas Light as well. Rachel is an unemployed, divorced alcoholic who takes the train into London every day to look for work. Her friend/landlady believes she is still working. The train pauses on the track behind Rachel's old house, where her ex-husband Tom lives with his new wife, Anna. Just down the street are ""Jess"" and ""Jason,"" a couple Rachel doesn't know but who she watches from the train every day, making up a story about their life in her head. One day ""Jess,"" real name Megan, disappears, and Rachel has some information she thinks will help ""Jason"" (real name Steve) find her.What follows is a mystery in which almost every single character is a suspect, including the narrator. Rachel is incredibly unreliable, something she freely admits to herself, since her drinking often leads to blackouts. Tom frequently told her about the things she did while drunk during their marriage. Then there is the fact that she only knows what she saw from the train, and given that she was already making assumptions about these people her eyewitness account is not trustworthy. Hawkins writes a great mystery, but she also writes wonderful character sketches of men and women who treat each other badly in different ways. Everyone, including the missing Megan, is fully realized in all of their goodness and badness. I loved how multifaceted each of these characters is. Nothing and nobody can be trusted, but after the plot tears through you you will have plenty to think about in terms of relationships, abuse, and dependence. "
723,Lisa Burrington,"I did not like any of the characters in this book but they were such train wrecks you had to keep reading just to see what would happen, I did not guess what was going to happen so it was a good read"
724,Jan Blazanin,"Every morning and evening Rachel rides the train past the neighborhood where she lived with her husband Tom a few years ago. Although he has a new wife and a young daughter, Rachel can't let him go. A few doors down lives another couple Rachel has named Jess and Jason. She watches them compulsively, envying them for the perfect life she imagines they have. None of these people, including Rachel, are who they appear to be, and two of them are hiding deadly secrets.Despite this novel's melancholy tone, readers who love unreliable narrators will be consumed by it. The characters aren't particularly likable, but the suspenseful, twisting plot will keep readers turning pages until all the characters' secrets are revealed. A great beach read."
725,Riley Vermilya,"This is definitely a faster paced Gone Girl and I couldn't wait to download and crank this out. I'm a sucker for hype and this suspenseful story is buzzing all over the place and I couldn't help myself. I normally read book club books since I am in 6. However, I pushed that pile away and jumped into this. I'm finally getting around to my review after letting this book swim in my head for a bit and decided this is probably a 4.5 star rating for me. It is not fabulous literature, but it is a page turner with many twists and it makes you realize the typical cliché...NOT everything is as it appears to be. Rachel, Megan, and Anna set the stage for this thriller ride and present the reader in each chapter with their personal voice. However, this is a train ride that literally leads to betrayal, death, and unexplained circumstances simply by witnessing a couple on a daily commute. This tale has the jilted lover, the other woman, the cheating wife, and spins into maddening chaos with the men involved. Jump on this author's first attempt at writing. It will NOT disappoint!"
726,Tammy Lee,"This was, as described on the cover, a compulsive read. A hard to put down, suspenseful thriller, full of secrets along the way. Told from the perspective of 3 female characters, all flawed with unreliable perspectives on the situation, no one seems trustworthy. I enjoyed how Rachel evolved, and how everything wove together, I enjoyed it right to the last page."
727,Rizello,"I did love the way that the characters developed and converged. I figured out the perpetrator about 2/3 way through, but it was still suspenseful and well written. I hope she writes more!"
728,Barbara Kling,I'm not sure how to review this without giving anything away.....but lets just say .... Rachel? Megan? Anna?
729,Lisa Bahlinger,Thrilling page turnerMasterful writing and unreliable narrators kept us guessing on what the truth really was. Excellent character development with Rachel and Megan. Recommended.
730,Jen Calonita,Had me from the first page and kept me up at night wanting to get to the end faster. Total page turner that will keep you guessing. So wish I had read this along with friends so we could discuss it from start to finish! 
731,Gloria Bernal,"3.5 stars. This is like nothing I've ever read before (Yes, I've read ""Gone Girl."") I wouldn't compare them.It opens with such a sad and pathetic individual as the main character (Rachel)...who rides a train into work every day and passes the same places. One where she used to live. She has a drinking problem and makes up fantasies of the people she sees in these homes each day. It is really an odd-sort of novel. None of the characters are likable, but you just have to find out what happens to them in the second half especially.We are learning the story line from the voice of 3 female characters, in present day, and in a few months past. I found it easy enough to follow. At times Rachel's part seemed repetitive, but she was trying to work through what she thinks she saw that resulted in a crime, and so it came across as believable. The critics/reviews are mixed on this. Make up your own mind, and don't compare it or expect it to be like anything else you've read before. "

733,Stacee Remsing,"Hard to put down, but about halfway through I felt it was very similar to the plot in 'Gone Girl'. Some parts were a bit too predictable but overall I enjoyed it. Quick read."
734,Diane D.,"I'm not quite sure why this book was so often compared to Gone Girl? I thought The Girl on the Train was a much more believable book, particularly the ending, and one that I enjoyed much more.This was a quick read and one that I always looked forward to getting back to. I liked the story being told in 3 different character voices, and I also thought it was very clever how the timetables differed and the story just about caught up at the end when it all comes together. You certainly can never tell what's what with anyone's life simply by observing from a distance. Things are not what they seem as this book proves spot on. And I found a new favorite literary friend in the book's primary character, Rachel. And some pretty despicable ones as well. I think this book could be open for a sequel, but in any event I would read another book by this author. Great job for a debut novel."
735,Xrys Blackearth,"I stayed up late to finish the book I started yesterday. The Girl on the Train. When I started the novel, I expected not to enjoy it. I didn't like the main character, I found her behavior childish and her choices weak and poorly made. It took a little time for me to connect with her because I had such issues with her behavior. Slowly I found myself drawn to the character and her interactions with the others around her. I found her entanglement with perception and memory, as well as to the impact of alcoholism on both, compelling. While I knew exactly who had done it and why well before the end of the book, I felt that it unfolded beautifully and told a story that was enjoyable as well as insightful. Aspects of the story which I have chosen not to reveal because they could easily be spoilers for some readers were realistic and cleverly presented.Part of my hesitance in picking up this book was my reaction to Gone Girl. Everyone I knew liked it. I hated it. I found it predictable from beginning to end, and I hated almost all of the characters. Girl on the Train did not strike me the same. By the end of the book I felt the character Rachel had developed, that Anna developed and changed, and that both had made a necessary journey to reach the end. The closer I got to the end of the book, the more compelling it became as a read. I did want to see how the author was going to finish it and I was not disappointed.So, if you are interested in a little murder mystery reading that isn't challenging but is twisty and fun as a read, with some moments of insight and realism, I encourage you to pick up The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins."
736,Tami Carpel,"Hmmm I'm not sure what to say about this book. It was like I was reading two different stories with the same characters. It started out a certain way but of course it ends totally different! I like the surprising turns that each of the characters takes and the authors keeps you guessing until toward the end. Even though I did suspect the little twist, the author did a good job keeping the reader guessing with all of Rachel's foggy memories and alcoholic blackouts. The beginning was a little monotonous, but if you stick with it, I promise it gets better and doesn't disappoint!"
737,Lariza Sedano salcedo,"Me gustó y lo recomiendo porque es un libro muy sencillo de leer y desde sus primeras hojas logra engancharte con la trama, me gusta como vas descubriendo poco a poco pequeños detalles que te van dando una idea más concreta de lo que la historia quiere contarte, hace mucho que no me pegaba a un libro de esta forma, así que por eso le doy cuatro estrellas.* spoilers *Ahora, si queremos hablar algo negativo sobre el libro (para mi). Algo que realmente no me gustó fue que en un momento llegó ser muy predecible la decisiones de Rachel, realmente cansaba y un poco que aburría cada tontería que hacía. Bueno si queremos interpretar a una alcohólica psicológicamente maltratada, tienen un punto. Pero.. ¿En serio?Y también es cierto que cuando se descubrió que no se sabía quién era el hijo de Megan, se predecía por descarte, quien era el villano, aunque había la esperanza que la historia te contara algo más que cambiara esto, pero no fue así.El desenlace si que me dejo un sabor incompleto, me imaginaba algo más a lo sicosis o asesino serial, pero hubo sangre, lagrimas y un sacacorchos, así que tan mal no fue.En conclusión es una historia muy atrayente, en especial en lo comunes que son los personajes y que si retrata la realidad, porque la mayoría de asesinos no son gente rara que vive aislada, todo lo contrario, son gente que parece tan normal como tus vecinos, por eso no pude dejar de leerlo hasta acabarlo. Tenía que saber cómo acababan los personajes. Una lectura muy recomendada para un viaje en bus o tren, creo que se leería con un poco más de placer en el trayecto a estudiar o trabajar, así que cada vez que levantes el rostro para darte un respiro, podrías imaginar, como Rachel, una gran historia de las miles caras que vez pasar cada segundo."
738,Tushar Kant  Naik,"With this one being first book from this author has curated best of fictional thriller world that a reader could dream of. With right amount of everything served through words, this book is the best read and worth all anyone's time. It took me really big amount of time to finish this book but eventually I'm pleased and entertained at the end. If not my favorite but still one of the I'd consider reading again for one more time. I loved every characters' life and view are explained with detailed words. Although there is just one main character but you can see that other characters are also treated with great care and nurture. Every one gets to say their own side of story. Their pain, their happiness and every other feeling they have for characters within the story. And word, phrases and syllables are aptly opted and worked like a charm. Slight of troubled because of author being a British, haven't really read any in past. Lies, betrayal, physical relationship out of marriage always lead to some messy outcome and never fading scars. How could someone even fathom to go to betray the persons who love them deep from heart. Or its just the thing that non deserving ones always get every thing they shouldn't, don't and never deserve. Alcoholism is a one of a kind cancer but that what two people promise each other when they get married to standby in any cancer. Oblivion and ignorance often seldom go side by side. How often do we dig deeper than that of catered to us. But hope everyone after this book to be contrast to what Rachel and Anna were. And running from a problem is not a firm or lasting solution. Wish Megan would known it. There are Toms every turn of life but there're also Scotts there's too. Hope everyone will enjoy reading this one and see you in next review.Ciao "
739,NancyL Luckey,"Couldn't identify/sympathize with any of the characters, but enjoyed the tension and mystery of the book. Well written and kept my interest till the end."
740,Lisa Black,"I really liked this book. I figured out the solution/ending/answer within the first quarter of the book but was never quite sure, wondering if the writer might pull a rabbit out of her hat. She didn't, but that was good. I found the resolution quite satisfying.Ps I listened to this as a library e-audiobook and the three female narrators were so totally spot on. Megan was particularly well cast."
741,Jess C,"I know I'm the last person to get on this train (ha)...WARNING! HERE BE SPOILERS. *just in case people yell at me*I listened to this on Audible (twice) and I think I've finally formed an opinion on it. I really did enjoy it; and I can see why people are comparing this to Gone Girl. However, the similarities between the two are only limited to the woman goes missing, it's a mystery novel and there's a big twist. The morals are completely different. Gone Girl is more distinctive in its morals, whereas The Girl on the Train is more of a traditional ""whodunnit"" story. And listening to the story twice definitely helps put the finale into perspective, especially when studying the character of the culprit. I won't spoil that here. The best way to absorb this novel would be on audio. If you're umming and ahhing about signing up for Audible, I'd suggest using this as your free novel. The voice actors are three women: Clare Corbett (Rachel), Louise Brealey (Megan) and India Fisher (Anna). I'm already familiar with India Fisher because of her work in Big Finish (she plays Charley Pollard, one of the Eighth Doctor's companions). They all do an excellent job at making the voices distinctive, and it's going to be hard to separate those voices from the actors that'll be appearing in the film, which I believe is coming out late next year. Emily Blunt is playing Rachel and I reckon she'll do a good job, provided that she fattens up a bit. I don't recognise any of the other actors. I heard buzz that they were switching the location from London to the US, but it looks like that's just a rumour. 4Overall, I enjoyed this one, but I suggest if you're wanting to take the plunge, to listen to the audiobook. "
742,Margarita,"Four well deserved stars!- holding-the-e-reader-until-your-knuckles-are-white suspense? Check- unpredictable plot? Check- drama/ murder/ psychological twists? CheckI thought the plot's layout, being unraveled through the same train journey and every time giving us a bit more information, was pure genius. It kept you on edge and changed course of your thoughts, suspicions each time. Why not five stars? Because the characters were ALL so unlikable. You could really not sympathize with anyone. By the time you learned the truth behind some of Rachel's problems, it was too late for any sympathy. Putting it all in perspective, they were all really f'ed up people. It's impressive to see them all in one story, and that made it unbelievable. Lastly, the prose was just too plain. I get it that it fit the characters, but I always want something more on text. Having said these, I would still pick another book from the author. "
743,Jumana [Books by Jay],"*4.5 stars*Amazing thriller! Had me on the edge of my seat the whole time :) Original review + SPOILERS on my blog: http://booksbyj.blogspot.com/2015/02/... I received this eARC from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. I was super excited to get into this book, a lot of people resembled it to Gone Girl and don't get me wrong, I LOVED this book.. but Gone Girl cannot be topped. This follows Rachel, a woman with too many troubles of her own and discovers an escape everyday on the train. She watches a couple on the terrace of their house and fantasizes about their relationship - their names, their jobs and their personalities. One day, crisis strikes and disrupts her already messed up life. Rachel finds herself involved in stuff that she cannot get out of. She was an unreliable narrator, one of many characters that I strongly disliked. All of the characters in this one were faulty characters and they were just terrible. I must say that this book was kind of boring at the start, it took me some time to get into it. Once I did, I was trying to crack the mysteries and figure out where on earth did the missing person go. I was juggling possibilities and honestly, I didn't see the ending coming AT ALL. I didn't see ANYTHING coming and that's why my rating was that high. The writing was phenomenal. Paula Hawkins made me visualize everything so perfectly and she had this ability of incorporating random clues throughout the book that tie in perfectly in the end. A mystery/thriller genius, I must say. All in all, this book was a fantastic ride, it had me thinking to this very day and I feel like it did stick with me. I remember every detail vividly and I'm writing this review a month or so after reading the book, that's an indication of how good it was! On the other hand, this book was a bit graphic, I would NOT recommend it to young readers. "
744,Joshua Buhs,"Very sure-footed, particularly for a debut novel.Paula Hawkens' book is a mystery tale, with a clever structure--just shy of abusing the reader, but never quite. The story starts with Rebecca, who commutes on a train to and from a job on the outskirts of London everyday. She comments in the morning, and again in the evening, at irregular frequencies. She's a drunk, and sad, and puts all of her hope into a couple she sees from the windows of a train.The story then switches gears, stepping back a year and into another character, Megan, who also records her days in the morning and evening. We learn that she is loosely connected to Rachel's story--although that connection becomes increasingly tight, after Megan disappears.The story proceeds on two tracks--pardon the pun--for a time, Megan's thoughts leading up to the day that she disappeared, and Rachel's growing involvement in the investigation around that disappearance.Soon enough, a third track is added, the story told from the perspective of another woman, Anna, who is married to Rachel's ex-husband. We are given to know that the break-up of the marriage was bad for Rachel, throwing her deeper into her cups, pushing her to harass the new family, particularly after Anna and Rachel's ex, Tom, have a baby.The story is given its narrative momentum by the careful restriction of knowledge coming to the reader, Part of that restriction comes from the structure, with its jumps in time; part of it comes from Rachel's drinking problem, which leaves her often unable to remember what she has done in the past.This careful doling out of information has given rise to a couple of invidious comparisons. A review by the New York Times on the back says that Hawkens is playing with an unreliable narrator: but that's not the case. Every narrator is fairly reliable, quickly recanting bad information. Their understanding of the world matches the world as we know it, except to the extent that they do not know certain things.There's also the (inevitable) comparison to Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl. (The title alone, with the ""Girl"" in it, invites the comparison, and possibly some opprobrium: but Rachel is a girl. She got lost on the way to adulthood and never made it there.) But the characters here are not like the one in Gone Girl, who was an unreliable narrator, and who was (almost) always in control. The characters here are more like those in Flynn's earlier two books, damaged and driven by bad impulses. They are female noir characters.The most unkind comparison would be to ""In a Dark, Dark Woods."" The only similarity is that the main character in each is a lonely British woman with memory problems. Here, the character's memory problems are rooted in the story, and so do not feel like a cheap trick. Nor does the structural withholding of information: its part of the fragmentary story telling style, one which echoes Rachel's own experience of the world.The central mystery isn't particularly mysterious--I figured it out at about the half-way point, and I'm usually slow on the uptake. But all mysteries have to be solved, and part of the joy of any mystery is seeing how the author has created and crafted the mystery and the world, and that keeps the reading engaging. One also wants to find out exactly how the characters will continue to screw up their lives, which they do. (Train wreck is another pun that suggests itself.)The only real drawback here also comes out of the structural choices Hawkens makes. Because she is withholding information, because the focus remains on the mystery, because the narrative flips through time and cuts out pieces of it, the characters never fully come to life. By no means are they entirely flat or stereotypical: Hawkens is too good a writer for that. But they are thin, two-dimensional. Too much of their thought, of their being in the world, is hidden. (The psychiatrist thing, though, is a bit over-used.)A minor flaw, though, all things considered, and this is a superior mystery. Really well done."
745,Britney,"This was an interesting read. The first part was a little slow to get into, but once you did you were quite hooked. I still have a few questions that were never answered, and i did kind of see it coming but not to soon it was still a surprise!This is a solid suspense mystery if you are into them, I just struggle to really like any of the characters. All in all if you like mystery you will enjoy the twists and turns of this one! "
746,Patrice,"Though I did not care much for any of the characters, the book was extremely well written. The author did an amazing job of building the intensity of the plot. It did start a little slow, but as the story progressed, I just could not put it down! I had to find out what happened to Meghan -- the missing girl. I did however predict correctly who the killer was. The author also did a great job of portraying the life of an alcoholic. I couldn't put this down!"
747,Booth Babcock,Gone Girl meets Bridget Jones. Drags a bit at the beginning but by half way through zips along through a series of unexpected plot twists. Great characters.
748,Miles,It's easy to get through this book when you realize all the characters are unlikeable and you truly don't care what happens in the end - you just want to get there and see who gets theirs. The twist isn't completely unpredictable but the ending left me really satisfied.
749,Alka,"it fills you with dread. A taut storyline. Involves marriage, its breakdown, aftermath, alcoholism, cheating, everything but above all, the banality of it all. Told from the eyes of the girl who travels on the local train in London and sees it all, what she doesnt see she imagines well. Not too much romance in the typical sense but aftereffects of love are what causes the whole complex situation"
750,Mairena,Reseña breve y sin spoilers en mi blog: http://www.mairenaruiz.com/resena-the...
751,Mia Michalek,"This book really surprised me. I wasn't expecting much from it, but I found myself reading it way past my bed time and when I wasn't reading it, I thought about the story. the story flows very well and has limited amount of characters, which is great, because you are not having to remember them all and go back to see who said what etc. The characters all meshed very well. If I have to say one negative thing about the story, is that it was to easy for me to guess who killed who."
752,Belinda Jane,"Fast paced and very easy to read, perfect book to sit down with over an afternoon or two and become absorbed in. The character development is well done albeit the making of some deeply disturbing individuals. The actual plot is fairly simple and not really unique (mostly a 'whodunnit') but there are twists and turns that keep it interesting and I found myself consistently struggling to believe anything I was reading. Worth a read."

I read Gone Girl more than a year ago, and I completely enjoyed the messed up novel. The Girl on the Train received a huge amount of praise because of its comparison to Gone Girl. There's no concrete similarity between the two, but there is a slight resemblance in terms of the theme. They are both psychological thrillers and I have to say that I really enjoy that genre. It would seem like a spoiler if I were to mention the ones talking in the novel. There are alternating chapters, but it would be safe to say that one of them is Rachel. She wasn't my favorite character while reading the novel, but there was something about her that made me want to finish the book right away. There was a sense of pity felt toward her. She seemed so desperate and crazy that I had to know what really happened. With a likable but imperfect main character, this novel turned out to be a better psycho-thriller than expected.The premise was absolutely compelling. There shouldn't be a reason for someone not be interested in the novel. When I read the summary at the back, I immediately bought the book even without checking the rating and some reviews here on Goodreads, despite what I normally do. A girl who takes the train everyday, but what she does while on the train, at a certain stop point, makes you rethink about public transportation and privacy. rThat being said, I had very high expectations, and gladly was satisfied after reading this. The other characters were even better than Rachel, the snooper who didn't seem to mind her own business. Their lives were a fun thing to read about, despite all the craziness. The crazier the better when we're talking about this genre. I would've liked it more if the author spent less time narrating (view spoiler)[ Megan  (hide spoiler)] and spent more time focusing on (view spoiler)[ Anna  (hide spoiler)]. I understand how important the former was as compared to the latter, but sadly I liked the latter one way better. My favorite character in the novel would have to be Tom. Stating my reason though might lead to a spoiler, so let's just say he was the most interesting one of them all.The reason why I rated this a 4 would be that it didn't reach the peak of my expectations. There was no major plot twist that really caught me off guard. I honestly saw everything coming, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy reading the novel. It was compelling despite knowing what's going to happen next, and in the end.4.5/5 stars. The only thing lacking would be the sense of surprise, but other than that, this was an amazing novel. If you liked Gone Girl, then odds are you'll enjoy this one way or another. Highly recommended. "
754,Stiby,"Lo primero que tengo que decir sobre este libro es que vino desde Uruguay y no me lo esperaba para nada. Me hizo muchísima ilusión, de verdad :)Por otro lado, no tenía intención de leerlo tan pronto, porque tenía algunos en lista que llevaba tiempo queriendo leer, pero encontré un grupo de gente haciendo una lectura conjunta de ""La chica del tren"" un día antes de terminar de leer ""Historia de dos ciudades"" y pensé que era una señal, así que me apunté a mí primera lectura conjunta. La verdad es que ha sido entretenido ir leyendo los comentarios de la gente y poniendo los tuyos de manera que sólo el que hubiese leído supiese de lo que hablabas y evitando los spoilers a los que fuesen más retrasados.Pasando ya al libro en sí, la verdad es que me ha gustado mucho. Es un libro que atrapa mucho, narrado en primera persona por distintas voces protagonistas, te interna a cada capítulo en un mundo diferente, a pesar de que apenas se mueve entre uno o dos escenarios. Leí un comentario de alguien diciendo que podría ser fácilmente adaptado al teatro y estoy completamente de acuerdo, dado que los escenarios son súper simples (y perfectos, creo que el libro no necesitas más).La trama es bastante sencilla de seguir para tratarse de un libro de misterio, y eso me ha gustado. No hay grandes quiebros y te lleva de la mano haciendo que te plantees distintas teorías. Es posible que sea algo previsible, no lo sé, tal vez es que yo estoy tan loca como algunos de los personajes y en cierto modo les leía la mente. ;-)Los personajes han sido de hecho, para mi gusto, el punto más flaco de la novela. No es que estén mal construidos en sí, pues creo que dentro de sus papeles, están de hecho bastante bien (mención especial Rachel), pero es que he sentido que son demasiado directos. No quiero matizar esto demasiado, pero es algo que he sentido con varios de ellos, que eran previsibles: el arquetipo de un personaje llevado al extremo. En general es un libro que me ha gustado mucho. Un misterio fácil de leer e interesante. Gracias a Anita Vela por organizar la lectura conjunta. Ha sido muy divertido :)"
755,°•·.๓คятค ,"4*Este livro foi-me oferecido por uma pessoa que, apesar de não o ter lido, achou que se identificava comigo... porque de outra forma não o teria lido, pois sempre achei que queriam fazer com este livro o mesmo do Grey, com tanta publicidade e mais a adaptação para o cinema, desvalorizei a história...E, o certo, é que fui surpreendida, e muito, pela positiva!Apesar de não gostar de narradores na primeira pessoa, neste caso, isso não se veio a revelar um aspecto negativo, porque a autora teve o cuidado de organizar a história pelo ponto de vista das três personagens principais, e acaba como sendo um diário ou uma conversa com cada uma delas, por isso, gostei imenso de conhecer a Rachel, a Megan e a Anna desta forma, três personalidades distintas com quem simpatizamos e antipatizamos, e que aparentemente pouco têm em comum, mas que juntas dão origem a esta história que realmente se torna de leitura compulsiva, absorvente, perturbadora e que nos deixa sempre em dúvida até quase ao final...Posso mesmo dizer que, tendo em conta as minhas leituras deste ano que se basearam essencialmente em autores ""preferidos"", Paula Hawkins já conquistou também lugar cativo nessa lista, resta-me aguardar pelo seu próximo livro, já em 2016... "
756,Teresa,"Quick, dark, suspenseful thriller which is sure to be this year's new viral ""Gone Girl"" substitute. I liked it much better than ""Gone Girl"" though in that it was more plausible and the characters, although flawed, aren't so over-the-top-evil. The story is told by the three female leads - Rachel, Megan and Anna - but, primarily Rachel. Rachel is THE girl on the train who witnesses something odd while glancing out the train window on her regular commute to the city and she begins to make disturbing discoveries. She is drawn into a situation that is adding to her already depressing life situation. Rachel's character made me want to abstain from ever drinking any alcohol again. She is a total disaster! We learn about all the characters gradually and there is a murder to be solved. When I thought I could make a guess as to who the murderer was, the author introduces a new plot twist...background information, family history, a recognized but unknown commuter, a judgmental police officer, etc. This was a real page turner. Would recommend to readers who like murder mysteries - an easy one/two day read. It was fun to read with a large group in my Goodreads women's book club. Can't wait to discuss it in our spoiler folder!(I bought the book and would be happy to share it with anyone interested in reading it next.)"
757,Marika Gillis,"This book has been getting a lot of attention lately. I feel like most of the books I read are a few years old (they were published 3 or more years earlier) but sometimes it's fun to read something right when it's at its peak. That's what I wanted when I picked this for our April book club read. Rachel is an alcoholic, still bitter about her not-so-recent divorce, and faking her commute to work each morning so her roommate won't realize that she's been fired from her job. Her daily commute also serves to feed her obsession for a couple that she obsessively watches along the route. When she sees something suspicious one day while on the train, and then discovers that the woman has been murdered, Rachel begins to insert herself into the life of the man she watches in an attempt to find out what has happened to his wife. Through her frequent blackouts and blurred memory, Rachel tries to solve the mystery all while continuing to stalk her former husband and his new wife and child. This is another example of a book (eh,eh... unavoidable Gone Girl reference there) where the main character is unreliable (at best), where none of the characters are likable (Rachel was desperate, Anna was smug, Megan was selfish), and where everybody seems to make dumb decisions. And, yet, I still enjoyed it! The book was a fast, fun read, a bit unnerving and creepy towards the end, and it kept me on my toes. Smarter readers will probably figure the end out before I did, but I like being gullible, especially when I find a book that scares me just a little like this one did.I did find the sections told from Anna's point of view annoying at first and I thought the time differences between sections were a bit confusing. They were too close together to have been separated the way they were (yet I'm not sure how the author could have done it differently).Just in case you were curious, the six people from my book club who read the book all liked it. I did think that was surprising, but it supports the mass appeal of the book and validates the attention the book has been receiving. This isn't the easiest book to get your hands on right now (if you don't want to fork out a little cash for it) so I have a copy if you want to borrow!"
758,Strawberry Fields,"4 1/2 starsI thought this book was great! It had me hooked from the very beginning.All the characters in this book have secrets. They are all basically deplorable. NO ONE can be trusted. This sets up for an awesome thriller read.I have seen a lot of people compare this to Gone Girl. I can kind of see the connection. I thought it was much more like Alfred Hitchcock's movie ""Rear Window"". Like jimmy Stewart, Rachel is an observer. She creates fantasies of the lives of people she sees when the train stops at the same light every day. She sees their house. She watches them. She does it to fill the emotional holes in her own life. Rachel is an alcoholic. One day she sees something that shatters the image of the perfect couple she watches. Of course, she doesn't know them. She has merely invented this perfect scenario. She becomes infuriated over what she has seen. She drinks and blacks out often. Someone comes up missing. The suspects are plentiful. My mind spun with the possibilities. I was thoroughly captured by this book. I couldn't put it down for the last half of the book, as sleepy as I was. When the end is such a mystery and you just HAVE to see how it ends, sleep is for wusses. This is one of those books that will keep you up all night. It is entirely creepy. LOVED IT!"

""There's nothing so painful, so corrosive, as suspicion.""
2015 Reading Challenge - A book published this year ✔Ok, esta fue una muy buena lectura. Entiendo toda la comparación con Gone Girl, pero yo no los metería en la misma bolsa. Quería aclarar eso.Para ser la novela debut de Paula Hawkins me pareció todo muy bien ejecutado. Si bien no me atrapó al instante, no tardo demasiado en hacerlo. Quería leerlo todo el tiempo, y mucho más teniendo en cuenta que amo este tipo de novelas. Es el tipo de historia que pone a todos como sospechosos en algún momento (en serio, a todos) y eso lo hace aún más intrigante. A mí me sorprendió, pero no fue un plot twist tan inimaginable como me resultó el de Gillian Flynn con Amy y Nick. Sin embargo, hasta cierto punto no tenía idea de cómo iban a resultar las cosas.Lo único que creo tener para criticar es que el final no me pareció que haga justicia a la gran historia que se venía tejiendo. Es más, me pareció un poco estúpido y ¿descuidado? No sé... me decepcionó un poco y me parece que podría haber sido mucho más interesante a pesar de que te tiene ahí, al borde de la silla por la tensión.Se lee bastante rápido y no es demasiado larga. Disfruté mucho del lugar donde está situada y cómo la autora hace del tren un personaje más. Me gustó mucho, y tengo muchas ganas de volver a leer algo de ella en cuanto decida escribir, es una gran novela debut."

All aboard!!!

TRUST NO ONE

I have lost control over everything, even the places in my head.
What? “Trust No One”? Why is that sign on the railroad of this review? Is this a “The X-Files” story? Oh, no, but certainly the motto of that iconic TV series is a good advice to anyone who dares to aboard this train of thought in this very particular journey to the minds of three women that you may think that they are quite different, but......maybe not......or maybe they do......mmh......remember about trust no one?......we’ll even you should not trust me neither......bwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!!!No, I’m kidding! I’m your friendly reviewer, surely you can trust me......bwa-ha-ha-ha!!!Okay, enough misleading malevolent mirth... for the moment...
BROKEN DOLLS

There’s nothing so painful, so corrosive as suspicion.
In this story you will have three voices in your head...Rachel: An alcoholic woman who failed in marriage.Megan: A pretentious woman who succeed in cheating.Anna: A married woman who who succeed in pretention.All of them are unlikely protagonists, hardly role models, sinners paying for their own faults, broken dolls in the middle of a railroad where fate is the train.They did their mistakes, but your own mistake can be to trust them... or me......bwa-ha-ha-ha!!!
WHAT WORKED BEFORE, WILL WORK AGAIN

There’s something comforting about the sight of strangers safe at home.
You may heard that this story is the “new” Gone Girl, and you would have heard well then.Actually, while it’s understandable that everybody knows about Gone Girl, there is another newer book that it could considered too into the formula in a sense...Gone Girl meets Elizabeth is MissingAnd also, there are two movies that came to my mind, no wonder, from the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock (who I have no doubt that if he would be still alive, he would adapt into a film this novel)...Rear Window meets The Lady VanishesThat, yes, they were based on previously printed material too.So, if you are fair familiarized with all those mentioned stories, you can quite well expect lots of trains, losses of memory, missing women, vouyerisms and misleadings...Bwa-ha-ha-ha!!!... wait! Why did I laughed this time? I believe that it’s one of the moments where you can trust me more... or isn’t?
EVERYTHING IS ACCORDING TO THE PLAN

Life is not a paragraph, and death is no parenthesis.
You may notice or not, while reading the different railroads, that the debutant, Paula Hawkins, the author, didn’t put anything random on the book, everything is according to the plan, even the dates, that honestly, they aren’t easy to keep on mind, but even those dates denote different kind of railway engines, while a side of the story can be told as a paused steam locomotive, another side is indeed a bullet train.But in any case, life hardly can be told in an instant, even the fastest deposition needs time, life is rich, life is complex, and if there is a saying that “each man is a world”, well I can say that each woman is an universe, a wonderful universe full of surprises, and while maybe in a whole another kind of context but (death) is hardly an ending, but just other twist in life.And what could be life without those wonderful unexpected twists?"
761,Aaron Lambert,"This was the first book I have ever read as part of a book club. It isn't one I would typically have picked up off the shelves to read on my own, but I'm glad I read it. It took a little while to get used to the switching back and forth of perspectives (I could have really used some head-shots of the characters, Paula Hawkins), but it was well worth the initial confusion. A great thriller that left me stumped until about three quarters of the way through - but granted, I'm not usually the first to figure it out. It was more than your typical ""who-dun-it,"" weaving an interesting tale of betrayal and manipulation through multiple story lines that all converge in the end. I would recommend it to anyone who likes to read mysteries or just likes a good story with believable characters. "
762,Lynsey,"I loved this book. My husband and I were browsing a bookstore in St Pancreas as we waited for our train (how fitting) when I saw this book. I had heard about it from friends and decided to buy it. I'm so glad I did. I found it a bit tedious at the beginning through the mundane train journeys with the star of the book, Rachel. I soon warmed to her and actually became concerned about her, willing her to stop drinking.....to make herself a new life somewhere away from Tom! I loved the 'Jason & Jess' fantasy Rachel created as I think, sat on a boring train gazing out of the window it can be quite easy to speculate about those you can see in their houses as you pass, never to see them again. Except Rachel does see them, constantly and so it begins. I strongly recommend you read this book, the characters are fascinating I found- none of them very likeable- all with a past and their lives embroiled in a most sinister way. I'm only giving it 4 stars as I did find it overall a depressing read...but still, a great read."
763,Murrill,"The story held my rapt attention for the first 75% of the book while each chapter was told from the point of view of one of three unlikeable women. It was as though I was reading their diaries, and the author captured their voices with poignancy and authenticity. The alcoholic's story was spot-on: The author draws a portrait of a woman who is desperate for purpose but who is defeated by her self-loathing, obsessions, and manipulations. She makes promises that she knows she will not keep, and she undermines any credibility she might have. In fact, each of the three women sabotages herself. Some might find this murder-mystery plodding at first, but I enjoyed the opportunity to acquaint with these women who were more damaged than ""bad."" The tempo changed during the final quarter as the loose ends are tied into a cogent conclusion, and I think the story lost some of its soul at that point. It became a crime drama instead of a thoughtful character development. Still, it was an enjoyable read, and I look forward to more from this author."
764,Jerra Runnels,"Really good story. Some parts were kind of slow, but I won't spoil anything by giving details. The ending was a huge surprise. Couldn't put it down at the end. "
765,Jo Chambers,"This is an excellent psychological suspense thriller. Rachel catches the same commuter train every day. It stops at a particular signal each time and she looks out over to a row of houses and to their back gardens, and she often sees a 'perfect couple' living out their lives there. If only she could be as happy as them... But things are never quite what they seem, and Rachel soon gets involved in their lives, which she finds starts to connect with her own broken life. This has been one of the best selling books of the year - and I can see why. The suspense and unease gradually builds and I couldn't turn the pages quick enough towards the end! Rachel is a flawed character but you do really feel for her predicament. I would definitely recommend this book, its a cracking read. "
766,Jeann (Happy Indulgence) ,"This review appears on Happy Indulgence. Check it out for more reviews! If you took the time to look up from your phone or book while on public transport, what would you notice? The Girl on the Train takes a simple, everyday concept and morphs it into a nail biting thriller, where a girl on a train becomes a key witness for a missing person.Rachel is an interesting, obsessive character who is deeply flawed as a raging alcoholic and struggling post-divorce. So what else does she do when she sees a happy couple every time the train goes past? She makes up ideal lives for them. But as we get intertwined deeper into the mystery, getting an insider perspective couldn’t be more different.You’ll get several different point of views here, from the past, the present and from various people. Absolutely everyone could not trusted and had their own secrets. They were all dysfunctional, only projecting to people what they wanted them to see. Although I did end up predicting some of what happened, my mind was racing all the way through the novel wondering who the culprit was, Rachel’s memory loss and what really happened. The tension in this thriller was high, not knowing how things were going to unfold and being glued to the pages until you reached the final, chilling crescendo.Adultery, depression, mental illness, domestic abuse and violence, The Girl on the Train makes us question what we see on the surface, and what’s behind closed doors. It makes you realise no one is as they seem, and we often project our own wishes, thoughts and feelings upon people we encounter. It’s amazing how much Rachel idealised her perfect couple, and the stark contrast that was presented as we got to know more about them. It makes us question, do we only see what we want to see?Although The Girl on the Train didn’t give me the mind fuck that Gone Girl did, I was still glued to its pages wanting to know what the final outcome would be. With a seemingly simple premise, the author morphs it into an overlapping web of intrigue, mystery and lies told through several unreliable narrators. If you love psychological thrillers, this is a great one to pick up and read on the train."
767,Diane Smith,What a great summer read. Really enjoyed the tool of using the train in the story. My face was always pressed against the window hoping for another clue. 
768,Narges,"It was about page 210 that I could say what will happen in the end and I was right :-DIt was a good read, with lots of ups and downs, I enjoyed it."
769,Katie Merideth,Great thriller. All the characters pretty much cray cray. 
770,Tori,"I finished this book last night, and I have been debating how to rate it..It's probably more of a 3.5 star book for me. There are things I really liked about it: I loved the chapters by three different characters, taking place in the morning or the evening. It was definitely easier reading this as a ""real"" book rather than on my kindle, because I often turned back to see what had happened when the person had last written, or what had happened at the same time in another character's life. I enjoyed the mystery - a woman is missing, and a group of people in a neighborhood had possible motives. Two things I didn't like: none of the characters were likable, and the ending confession seemed too contrived.Rachel is an alcoholic, who's lost her job and her husband, but still takes the train into ""work"" so she can appear to be working to her landlord/friend. She sees the flats in her old neighborhood along the way, and notices a ""perfect couple"". In her mind, she names them, imagines what they're like, and feels as if she knows them. One morning, she sees something strange - and the mystery begins. I felt sorry for Rachel - and for many of the characters in the story. Each one is her/his own worst enemy, and no one is strong enough to resist temptation, or to make a change for the better. I think there are many people like Rachel in the world - they WANT to be a part of things, they want to be liked, to be helpful, to make a difference, but they have such a difficult time separating fantasy from reality. Some reviewers, I noticed, said the culprit was too easy to figure out. Not for me. I had no idea who was guilty until quite a way through the book. So, I liked the concept - but I wish I liked some of the characters more."
771,Parva 'chhanu' Chhantyal," WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 2015 MORNINGIt's 8 o'clock in the morning. I am running to the train station. There are two trains I can catch, at 8:07 am or at 8:10 am. If I leave my home exactly at 8, I can catch 8:07 train but if I am 2 minutes late, I can get 8:10 one. Anyway, that 3 minutes doesn't really matter that much. I will reach 3 minutes late at work but today, I can't wait to catch 8:07 train because I can't wait to get to the train station and sit in there, and start my new book. Yes, I am starting my new book today called 'The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins'. Its a murder mystery. I saw there are mixed reviews about it on goodreads but sometimes I don't like to listen to those reviews. I just want to read even though they say it's bad. Shouldn't we see ourselves why they say its bad? and the only way to see it is, by reading it. Anyway, I have a good feeling about it. Its not always I read mystery books. I open the book and read it. The train is quite packed. Germans like working early. It's really really packed. There is no seat for me. I am standing but I am reading. Few pages into the book, its time to get off.  EVENINGIts nearly 8 pm. I sat on the train and opened the book. Hmm... this is about a girl Rachel who is drunk all the time. She lost her husband to someone 2 years ago but still hasn't gotten over it. Recently, she lost her job too. In order to avoid telling her flatmate about the job, she pretends to go to work. Everyday she takes the same train into London. From the train she sees her old house which is shared by her ex-husband and his new wife now. She also sees their new neighbours who she doesn't know but have now become familiar figures since she sees them almost everyday from the train. She names them Jason and Jesse.  I am now home and can't wait to finish my dinner and go back to the book. At around 10 pm, I start reading again. So the neighbours of her ex-husband are Scott and Megan (although she named them Jason and Jesse). One day, from the train, Rachel discovers Megan kissing someone who is not Scott. Soon after that, Megan disappears completely. Her disappearance becomes a big talk of the town. Rachel, thinking that it might be something to do with a guy she was kissing, goes to Scott to tell him what she saw.  I am completely engrossed in the book. Next time, I check the clock, its 2 o'clock in the morning. I should sleep now.  SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 21, 2015 MORNINGThis is my 4th day in this book. The story is getting interesting. I am back to the book. I confess it's bit boring in the beginning but after 50% its getting interesting again. They have found the body of Megan now but who could have murdered her? and why? and why I do I feel like every character in this book is messed up and has sort of psychological problem? but something is making me read it though. There is something interesting which I can't describe, probably an urge to know who exactly is the culprit and why? Anyway, I have got shopping and laundry to do now. I will catch up with this book later.  EVENINGWhat???? It was him? Oh my beautiful God! I couldn't have imagined it in any way. Its been 4 hours that I am reading this book continuously. For some reason I could't keep it down. Now, its finished, time to read its reviews on goodreads! SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 22, 2015 MORNINGWhy is everyone talking bad about this book? It was ok for me. May be I don't understand the real taste of the mystery since I don't read them that much but it was not that bad. Atleast this book has taught me that people's lives are not as same as they show you. Long time ago my friend and I had a big argument over someone's post on Facebook. I told him why he can't be like that 'someone'? His argument was 'Not everything is same as people show you on Facebook'. I felt exaclty like that after reading this book. Everyday I take trains and although it was somewhere behind my brain, I never properly imagined everyone sitting there has some stories. This is the book that shows you the prospective of lives from other's view. Oh well, I got to be honest. I kind of enjoyed it so, I will give it 4 stars. Scheiße! Tomorrow is Monday :( "
772,Swanbender2001,"But Rachel is living a lie and dealing with alcoholism and a very active imagination.Jess and Jason are really Meghan and Scott and are not living the ideallic life Rachel has conjured for them a few doors down from Rachel's ex-husband. This story is full of plot twists, lies and suspense and it was really hard to give a hoot about any of the characters. I did find it hard to stop listening to it though because I wanted to hear how things really happened and not how Rachel imagined them. "
773,Stacey Jones,"This book is SO GOOD at what it is good for! I do see things about it that could be better executed in terms of the writing, but I'm happy to admit I was riveted. (I enjoy enjoyable things.)This book is written with three points of view in turns: Rachel, the primary POV, who is an alcoholic, whose failed marriage finds her living with a roommate in suburban London while her ex-husband, Tom, has stayed on in her former home with his new wife, Anna, and their baby. Rachel takes the train into London every day, so her roommate won't ask her why she lost her job (drunkenness), and the train stops so she can see the gardens of her former neighborhood, including the home of Megan and Scott. Not long into the novel, Megan goes missing, and Rachel thinks she has seen something material to the case. Of course, given her erratic history and current alcoholism, she is not the police detectives' most reliable witness. The page-turning-ness of the novel takes place as the three perspectives intertwine, Rachel's, with Megan's and with Anna's (who has the fewest pages devoted to her POV).This book, like Gone Girl, is so easily envisioned as a movie, and indeed, one is coming out in 2016, with Emily Blunt starring as Rachel. It may also be one of those movies that are better than the book. At first I found it interesting, and perhaps intentional, that the three female narrators--protagonists, if you will--merged together a great deal in my mind. Is Hawkins trying to make a point about the necessary conformity of suburban life for women? Or is she not writing the characters well enough to make them truly different people on the page? The ending is one I did not see coming, but it also one of those that simultaneously surprise and yet seem inevitable. It only surprised. I didn't think enough of a breadcrumb trail was left in the narrative to make the turn seem natural, organic, even if there are readers who saw it coming. I found the examination of Rachel's alcoholism very interesting; I've never read anything about this written in this way. It endows her with a pathos that Megan and Anna don't have, even though I think Hawkins wanted to endow Megan similarly, the writing just isn't rich enough for her--it's too expository rather than illustrative. Anna is very two-dimensional, even in the end. But, as I wrote at the beginning, I'm giving this book four stars because it is GREAT at what it is good for, a page-turning, suspense novel, plot driven and fast-paced. It's not something that will keep yielding fruit upon more readings, but as ""plain fiction,"" it's pretty engaging! "
774,Do,"I enjoyed this book, I wanted to know what had happend. I think this is a good book, but not as good as everyone is saying."
775,Matt Smith,"Every morning Rachel, a lonely divorcée, rides the commuter train to London, fantasizing about the lives of a happy couple that she sees everyday who live in a home by the tracks. She's named them Jess and Jason, and they have a wonderful life in her mind. Rachel is envious; she feels connected to them. Then one day on the train she sees something strange, brief as she passes, so much so that Rachel doesn't know if she really saw it or if it was her imagination. And when Jess disappears Rachel finds herself swept up in a investigation where she may know more than she realizes.The Girl on the Train is a remarkable debut by Paula Hawkins. The story-telling capitalizes on multiple first-person narratives, blending styles reminiscent of Gillian Flynn and S.J. Watson to craft a clever story told from disparate viewpoints. Rachel, for all her good intentions, is terribly self-destructive, questioning both her judgement and her motivations for getting at the truth. Rachel invented Jess and Jason's happy life, imagining them how she wanted. There are stories we tell ourselves, and stories we choose to believe. And now Rachel wants to know what really happened.It's been a while since I read a suspense genre story this fresh. Although I had some suspicions a quarter of the way in — some that proved true — The Girl on the Train is a very smart, well-paced thriller. There are some pieces of the story that I think could've been fleshed out more but Paula Hawkins gives readers just enough to know her next book should be short-listed."
776,megan.lynn♡,"The Girl on the Train is a psychological thriller about a girl named Rachel who takes the same train every day, passing the house of her ex-husband, Tom, and his new wife, Anna, as well as the neighbors, who Rachel calls ""Jess and Jason"". She finds herself feeling connected to Jess and Jason, as if she knows them personally. One train ride allows Rachel to witness something shocking that she believes will help solve the unusual disappearance of ""Jess"". When she approaches Jess's husband with this information, she finds herself more involved than she expected...My attention was definitely kept during this novel. Anxiety, along with curiosity, took hold of me and it was hard to put the book down. Hawkins also did a fantastic job with character development, which left me feeling as though I knew each character personally, especially the main character, Rachel. I sympathized with Rachel and felt her pain, felt sorry for her. It's hard for me to actually connect emotionally with a character, but Hawkins got the job done.This book is narrated by three women: Rachel, Anna, and ""Jess"". I must admit, at first I was a little confused by the timeline, but that confusion quickly left me once I continued on a little further into the book. I can actually say that I wouldn't have preferred the book to be written any differently. Reading the perspectives of each character allowed me to connect with and understand each character's feelings a lot better than had it been written with one narrator.This is one of the better thrillers that I've read in a while, and I would recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys reading suspenseful, unsuspecting ""Who-Dun-It's"". I can promise you, you will never guess the outcome... I didn't."
777,John Boettcher,"This is definitely a book for lovers of ""Gone Girl"". A classic whodunit but written in the multiple perception points of view that made books like Gone Girl such a hit. This psychological thriller happens to be set in England, and has a bit of English slang in it from time to time for those maybe not accustomed to British speak. But in short, the book was done very well. I liked the multiple personalities the book had, as it made you keep pieces of the story going in your mind that were happening concurrently, but from different perspectives. That tool was a bit disorienting at the beginning of the book as the reader has little warning that it is going to happen, as well as no reference point to establish the personalities of the different narrators until you were well into the story. The storyline itself was actually pretty good and extremely well thought out. As the author, I can't imaging what her whiteboard had to have looked like as she plotted out the story from start to finish. Even a rough draft would have to be pretty intricate. Then weaving the tale together through the maze of all the different points of view, brought everything together and pulled off a wonderfully thrilling read. Definite psychological thriller. And that appears to be the book genre of the year. No more Harry Potter hats and wizards, no more vampires and werewolves, now we have the newly invented psychological thriller in which authors attempt to outdo themselves in originality. In this case, I give it 4 stars because Gone Girl was better, more shocking, but in this book, Hawkins still gives you entertainment well worth the price of admission. "
778,Paula,"The Girl on the Train is actually a story about three different women - Rachel, a miserable drunk, Megan, a meandering slut, and Anna, the pinched up woman who stole Rachel's man. So many women's novels now hinge on multiple points of view, and while it's often used to drum up suspense, for me, it sometimes tends to pull me out of the story, which it did here. Hawkins does a fine job of characterizing an alcoholic with all her faults and black outs, and I think the novel might've benefited by staying strictly in her voice. The reader only gets to see events through her distorted vision and wonder what is true and what isn't.However, the narrative line is derailed by two other cringing voices that in many ways tend to collide into one another and sound like the same woman. For example, both Anna and Megan complain over and over again in their dated day and evening entries about how bored they are with suburban life. Their lives effectively either revolve around children or primarily the men they're involved with. No wonder they're whining.The plot is told to the reader through quick, jarring entries which coincide nicely with a day-to-day commuter's life, though the drawback is that scenes where the reader gets to participate in the action are few. As for the ending, I predicted it twenty pages in. There were no red herrings, no other real suspects to consider, and while the writing is strong The Girl on the Train slows midway in momentum and becomes a somewhat monotonous, one way read."
779,Giulia Astarita,"Ecco qui la mia recensione su uno dei libri più in voga di questa estate. La trama è molto accattivante: Rachel è donna alcolizzata, la cui vita è andata in pezzi dopo il divorzio da suo marito Tom, scappato con un'altra, ha ormai un solo momento felice e di svago: quello in cui il treno che prende tutte le mattine per andare a lavorare a Londra si ferma ad un semaforo, permettendole di spiare la vita di una coppia sposata la cui villetta è vicinissima ai binari. Rachel, nella sua estrema solitudine, si è affezionata ai due coniugi, belli e innamorati, che tutte le mattine fanno colazione in giardino, arrivando perfino ad inventare dei nomi per loro. Tuttavia una mattina vede qualcosa di diverso e anomalo, che manderà in pezzi le sue fantasie e creerà un inevitabile collegamento tra lei e la coppia.Mi fermo qui per non rovinare la sorpresa a chi ancora non lo ha letto.In giro per il web si dice veramente di tutti su questo libro! Dai paragoni con ""La finestra sul cortile"" del maestro Hitchcock, a quelli con il più recente successo di Gillian Flynn, Gone girl (breve parentesi per consigliare a tutti quelli che non hanno visto il film di Fincher con Ben Affleck la lettura di questo meritevolissimo thriller), quanto a me... Beh sicuramente non è all'altezza di nessuno di questi due paragoni ma, merito soprattutto del susseguirsi di una serie di colpi di scena ben costruiti e dei capitoli brevissimi che spingono sempre a pensare ""ma si, ancora un altro e poi smetto"", questo libro si legge tutto d'un fiato, impossibile staccarsene.La storia è tutta al femminile, narrata dalle tre donne protagoniste, ossia Rachel, Anna (la nuova moglie di Tom) e Megan (la sposina), che però per i miei gusti sono poco caratterizzate, troppo simili tra loro (alcolismo di Rachel a parte).Nel complesso il mio giudizio è comunque positivo: 7/10Passate a trovarmi sulla mia pagina Facebook, per scambiare opinioni e consigli! www.facebook.com/quandounlibroticambi..."
780,Jeannine,"I highly recommend the audio version of this book. The various British actresses narrating the different character points of view are fabulous and give each character a richness and depth that might not otherwise be felt if you just read the print version. It seems that all the reviews are either love it or hate it. I loved it, I really did. The writing is solid, smart, and tinged with the right amount of mystery and intrigue to make you want to pick it up again. The unreliable narrators are compelling in their delusions and make you want to find out more about their motives, their backstories, and how they fit into this puzzle of a story. My only complaint about the novel is that it's a bit too slow in the first half. Rachel, in all her alcoholic glory, is really given too much time, in my opinion, although I see why Hawkins gives her so much time. It does build up the mystery, but this could have been done in fewer chapters. I noticed that a lot of people have complained about hating all of these characters. I didn't hate anyone but Anna, really. I felt a soft spot for Rachel and Megan. For fans of smart Brits revealing their dark sides, this book is a must-read."
781,Anne Martin,"I did like this book, but I did not love it. From the early pages, you know there is a young woman who has disappeared. The book goes on, slowly at the beginning, faster after a while, by giving you daily accounts from three persons, Rachel, the main narrator, Megan, the missing one and Anna, the new wife of Rachel's ex.You meet a few characters, Tom, Rachel's and Anna's husband; Scott, Megan's husband; Kamal, Megan's therapist; plus some who fill up the empty spaces, like the 2 police inspectors, or Rachel's landlord Cathy.You know something has happened to Megan, but you don't know what -at least for a while, and you try to guess who is the bad one until the end.I still have not understood who leaked stuff about Megan to the police, when no one knew about it, nor the characters situation with money. Scott and Tom bought houses with their wives, then Tom bought Rachel out. How come she is broke then?If there is a big loan on the houses, how can they afford to pay for it when their present wives, Megan and Anna don't work anymore?I have more questions, but they would be spoilers.Anyway, that is what blocked me from loving the book. It is good, it would be better if those plot holes were fixed. Maybe too the very limited amount of suspects who are eliminated one after the other for bad reasons, after being suspects for worse reasons.Another thing which bothered me. It's the glowing reviews from Tess Gerritsen, S.J.Watson and others. You expect something amazing, while a little voice tells you it is just well organized publicity. "
782,Travis Rockwell,"4.5 stars Girls, Girls, Girls!I loved the way the book was written, the story was well thought out, great flow. The story is told from the perspective of 3 women, Rachel, Megan and Anna. This gives us a better understanding of the drama that involves all 3 women, and when I say drama, I mean Drama! Very thrilling read, kept me turning pages. I did have a theory 100 pages in and it turned out I was right, although throughout it did make me second guess myself a few times. I enjoyed this book and believe it lived up to the Hype. Thank you Paula Hawkins for the entertainment."
783,Gracedanni,"This is my first attempt at ever reviewing a book so please excuse my inexperience! Pros: Gripping, page turning thriller yet also atmospheric read. Great description of the surroundings. Very dark, loved the alcoholic POV. Multiple perspective done really well. All the women were interesting. Mystery is done well, unlikeable complex characters with secrets unravelling at a consistent pace. No boring parts. Cons: Small con only! Grubby! This is a PERSONAL dislike but I felt disgusted at how dirty, bloody and unravelled the main character Rachel was. As a daily commuter, smelly coats, drunks and bleeding nails on the train are a nightmare! I had guessed the suspect quite a bit before the big reveal. ****SPOLIER*****I guess I had a problem with Megan's POV exclusively leaving out Tom's name in order to maintain the mystery. The mystery depended on Paula Dawkins withholding the killer's name. It wasn't as if we were given all the information and we needed to piece it together. Maybe if Megan's point of view was presented through different mediums or varying levels of detail for each encounter with these men would disguise how heavily this story depended on Paula withholding vital information. This is a debut. Everything is refined. I am only nitpicking after all! Really, the descriptions of the street, the suburb, neighbourhood and the English countryside were wonderful! It was witty and interesting."
784,Jamise,"Wow, what an insane read! Be prepared for a roller coaster ride. I couldn't decide if I liked the characters but yet I wanted to figure them out. Great story telling, strange characters coupled with just enough mystery to keep the reader flipping through the pages aggressively.They are calling this the next ""Gone Girl"" but I feel it's a close second. ""The Girl on the Train"" is definitely my first favorite for 2015! Treat yourself to this read, you will not be disappointed."
785,Didi,"3.5 starsIt took me 4 weeks to read this, however the last third within a span of a day while commuting to/ fro work. I persevered the first half of the book, nearly giving up. It wasn't a page turner as what other readers have mentioned. It was only the last third of the book when I really got into it. I can see why people comple this book with Gone Girl though I really do hope that the trend of having twists will fade, if not it will not be so unexpected. Just look at M Night Shamalan."
786,Chantelle,"I really loved this book, it was one it took me quite a while to figure out the ending too which is always exciting. I really understand what they meant by it being similar to gone girl, even so far as the characters go, Megan seems to be similar in some ways to Amy, except maybe more emotional and involved.I was struck by how much I disliked the main character, and whilst I later became sympathetic towards her, I still did not necessarily like her, though I don't think you were meant to.The excerpts at the beginning of the book were a very nice touch, as was the use of intertextuality, in particular the ee cummings quote ""life is no paragraph"", and the continued appearance of the phrase ""don't expect me to be sane about this"".The way in which the characters interacted with one another is decidedly post-modern, emanating that sort of Wheeler-esque approach to relationships; the lack of emotion; the subject of children (such as in who's afraid of Virginia Woolf, in which their inability to have a child nearly tears them apart); extramarital affairs; and a general disillusionment and disassociation with life are present.I cannot think of a word to describe Anna and Tom's relationship that does not sound ablist, so I guess I'll just have to say it seemed almost clinical. Hawkins has an amazing talent of being graphic and descriptive without in fact describing. Some points we noted were the way in which she described the G+T's Rachel would drink, the holiday drink evoking the memory, and the horrible scene of the baby in the bath, that was not at all spoken of in detail, yet succeeded in being incredibly distressing to read or contemplate. "
787,Joelle Klein,"Fun, quick page-turner. I agree with others that it's not as good as Gone Girl, but still very enjoyable."
788,Allison,Reminded me a bit of a British version of Gone Girl. I enjoyed how things weren't as they seemed!
789,Melissa Marin,"Even though I figured out the ""whodunnit"" of it all pretty early on, I wanted to keep reading and stayed up late to finish this. I enjoyed the different narrative voices for each woman and the way the story explored the darkness and imperfection not only in human behavior but also, highlighting the flimsiness of memory and how misleading public appearance and our perception of others can be. Unlike many modern stories of this kind, there was a pretty tidy bow wrapped up at the end which can be a good or bad thing, depending on your tastes. Random side note: the story is set in England and I learned what I can only assume is British slang, as I've never heard it used in the US - the word ""grizzle"", which I know to mean like ""Grizzled, rough, old woodsman hermit with a beard and rough edges"" and this book uses repeatedly in relation to a baby, seemingly replacing a term like ""fussy"". So, there you go."
790,Lottie,"It was very ""Gone Girl"", maybe even a little bit better. "
791,Ellen Allen,"A lot has been said about The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins, particularly in comparison to Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl. Both are thrillers with unreliable narrators at the centre and both have stuff to say about women and modern relationships. I love them equally - it doesn't have to be a choice, does it? This isn't Desert Island Discs - but I think the main conceit is better in Train than Gone Girl.The Girl on the Train follows Rachel, who is spiralling out of control after the end of her relationship with her ex-husband. She takes the same train every day - apparently to work - and as the train stops every day at the same signal, she invents an imaginary life for the couple who live in the house opposite. It's a life she obviously wishes she had, and at the first opportunity - when the woman goes missing - she plants herself into the story. What makes the book exceptional however, isn't just the interesting plot. It's the way it's told.It can be hard sometimes to completely believe in a thriller once the main conceit is revealed. In Gone Girl, for instance, it became harder for me to care as much about the book once the moral ambivalence of the central character, Amy, is revealed - not because I liked her any less, but because it was clear then what she intended to do and the mystery was gone; you knew where the book was going.What makes Rachel, in The Girl on the Train so wonderful to follow, is that she isn't so much morally ambivalent as just drunk, depressed and lost. So, we're not entirely sure if she's guilty or innocent. We can't tell if she's involved, you don't know what she's done and you can't tell if she's reliable or not (or rather, if her drunken memories are reliable or not). We have to piece together the story bit by bit, with her, and that makes it interesting. I flinched with her, every morning, when she woke up in a panic, trying to run through the events from the day before. It's a wonderful way to reveal the story, lots of oh-my-god-what-has-she-done-now? moments and it also kept me involved in where the mystery was going until the last possible moment. It's also written very convincingly and chimes with a wonderfully written article on alcoholism and drunken ""black outs"" by Sarah Hepola in The Guardian this week.You feel sorry for her and her need to stay involved in strangers' lives but at the same time, there's something very human about her situation and I liked her a lot, not in spite of her flaws but because of them.This is taken from my blog, ellenallen.co"
792,Anoop Nair,"One word, Gripping. That's this book. Good suspense as well. but the main thing I liked in this book is the way how she tells the story. From three different women and traversing the time forth and back. I loved reading this and would suggest to anyone who loves crime and thriller."
793,Celeste,"4.5Let me start off by saying that I gave Gone Girl (to which this book is often compared) 4 stars as well, even though there was some part of me that didn't like that book. It was like a train wreck from which I couldn't look away. This was not another Gone Girl for me. Yes, everyone is just as messed up, but I didn't stick with it out of morbid curiosity. I actually cared about how it ended. The fact that everyone is horribly distorted in this story helps make it powerfully character-driven. It was also well written, with psychological twists that made everyone unreliable as narrators. (There are three, by the way.) It became difficult to identify the fallacies meant to mislead from the clues that were actually important.I also want to mention that I suspected the true killer early in the story, but it did not diminish the enjoyment of reading this and waiting to find out if I was correct."
794,Bill Krieger,"First sentence:  She's buried beneath a silver birch tree, down towards the old train tracks, her grave marked with a cairn.The Girl on the Train is a one-trick pony, but it's a good trick (a good pony?). The narration alternates between the three main female characters: Rachel, Megan and Anna. The trick is that we are exposed to each woman's inner loop, the monologue they are having inside their head. And that monologue is extremely negative. We are privy to all their paranoia, depression, self-pitying, delusion, and meanness as they interact with the world around them. Wallowing is the verb that comes to mind. (ha)That interaction is really fascinating. The girl on the train, Rachel, sits there and, in her head, decides that everyone is silently judging her as fat, stupid, alone, a loser, etc. We, the reader, know she's just spinning negativity without it being explicitly written. This is a most effective way of showing the impact of this negativity on each girl. It's also interesting and realistic that these women use this negativity as a rationale for acting out in hurting themselves (drinking, sleeping around) or hurting those around them (lying, infidelity).The plot, the mystery, in The Girl is good enough. But the focus is definitely the lives and loops of the main female characters. It's not always easy swimming in that negativity, but it was wonderfully realistic.QOTD
I close my eyes and let the darkness grow and spread until it morphs from a feeling of sadness into something worse: a memory, a flashback.- Rachel, The Girl on the Train 
One thing I couldn't figure out. There's a lot of drinking in the story, but none of the women is on ""meds"": anti-depressant or anti-anxiety medication. I'm surprised this wasn't an element of the story given how prevalent these pills are today, especially with women.A good read.thanks... yow, bill"
795,Jilian,"This book is intoxicating, to say the lease. Its twisted and warped, telling the tale of people who seem ordinary enough. But don't expect to like any of them. They're all messed up in some way and that's what makes this book great.This book is well written and will entice you to keep reading long past your bed time. If you like Gone Girl, you'll like this,"
796,Audrey,I enjoyed this book! The mystery and the characters hooked me right away. It was hard to put down at times. Pretty good book for being the author's first thriller!
797,Renu Sharma,"I found the book gripping enough ! I just couldn't help myself to keep the book down, but turn pages instead, as I go on reading ! I have seen the movie Gone Girl...so this book as well comes so close to it.The best part of my reading was that, every single page held my attention from first to last !! It made me like Paula Hawkins so much ! ;)A thriller very well written !"
798,Melissa Service,"This is a great ""gaslight"" novel. This book was a bit like a train wreck- I wanted to put it down because the main character was horribly destructive to herself and everyone around her, but I couldn't. I was very relieved to find (in my opinion) it was nothing like Gone Girl, and I wish people would stop comparing the two-though I understand it's good publicity for Ms. Hawkins. My only complaint was the story wrapped up a little too tidy for my taste, and it was difficult to keep track of the jumping dates, but I look forward to reading more from Paula. I wish her the best success for such a fine debut novel."
799,Aura,"Nu mi-a plăcut „Fata dispărută”, care mi s-a părut monotonă și previzibilă, iar când am văzut că „Fata din tren” e comparată mereu cu „Fata dispărută”, m-am gândit puțin dacă s-o citesc sau nu. Pe măsură ce citești descoperi tot mai multe asemănări între cele două cărți, deci se poate spune că povestea nu e chiar originală. Mi se pare că această carte este „Fata dispărută” într-o versiune mai bună. Am citit-o într-o singură zi. E genul acela de carte care te captivează cu totul și finalul nu e așa de ușor de intuit ca la „Fata dispărută”.M-a dezamăgit puțin la final, totuși, pt că s-a terminat prea sec, brusc, dar mi-a plăcut pentru felul în care e scrisă și te ține lipit de ea."
800,Samantha A,"4.5 starsTHAT WAS SO STRESSFUL! What an ending! I was wary of this book at first because of the hype surrounding it and after looking at some mixed reviews. I thought it would be an instance where readers not familiar with the thriller/mystery genre overhyped a mediocre book, but I was wrong. This was a very well paced, well thought out and intense thriller! It wasn't the most original storyline and it kind of followed the thriller textbook, but it was well written and I was still caught by surprise by the ending. There were also a lot of dark elements intertwined into all of the character's backstories. Noone was exempt from a fucked up past, and I enjoyed that (Is that twisted? It's fiction, so no). I enjoyed uncovering all of their secrets and finding out that no one was perfect, no matter how they looked on the outside. I didn't figure out the culprit super early on, but I figured it out a tiny bit before the author actually revealed it, and it's been a long time since I've had that moment of clarity in a book. I read the sentence (view spoiler)[ where Rachel is recalling the encounter under the bridge and she realizes it wasn't Anna getting into the car (hide spoiler)] and it just clicked.. I had to set the book down and just looked up like AH-HA!!It's always good fun when you read a bestseller that is currently receiving a lot of praise, and enjoy it immensely. Good job, Paula Hawkins. “A tiding of magpies: One for sorrow, two for joy, three for a girl, four for a boy, five for silver, six for gold, seven for a secret never to be told”"
801,Sandy Emmons,I thoroughly enjoyed this book from beginning to end. I wanted to be reading all of the time and that is the sign of a good book. Yes it does remind me somewhat of Gone Girl but I enjoyed this more.
802,Nick Simmons,"Dark and insightful, as a reader you're thrown right into the heads of each of the central characters. As the story unfolded I found myself sympathising with characters and appreciating that circumstances and others had played a part in shaping them and leading them to their current situations. I enjoyed the growing awareness they developed, not only of others, but of themselves. This book has twists aplenty and always left me wanting to find out what happened next."
803,Deborah Edwards,"In most people's lives, there are what I call ""familiars."" These are the store clerks or baristas or subway travelers we see on a fairly regular basis, the somewhat familiar faces that show up in our existence time and again - people we think we may ""kind of know,"" but who we do not really ""know"" at all. And in our heads, maybe we play this little game where we imagine what their lives might be like beyond the context of our acquaintance. ""Maybe Kent the toll taker has a young wife and three children at home and they live in a cramped tenement apartment with Kent's ailing mum?"" It's tempting to create a backstory and then convince ourselves that it is real. Or maybe we think that we can gauge a person's character by virtue of their looks or their demeanor. ""That waitress is always so pleasant to me - she must be a nice person, right?"" ""That guy at Starbuck's is so handsome, I'll bet his wife is a lucky woman."" Which is probably why the neighbors of serial killers, when interviewed on television, always say ""He seemed such a nice, quiet fellow. Always polite, always helpful. I can't believe he would ever do such a thing."" We all think we know the familiars in our lives...but we don't really know them at all. ""The Girl on the Train"" is arranged around that same premise. Part ""Rear Window,"" part ""Yellow Wallpaper"" and part every mystery you have ever encountered that involves suspicious suburbanites, a missing woman, and unreliable witnesses, this book follows our main protagonist, Rachel, who has created a backstory for two of her ""familiars"" - a couple who live in a home she sees from her train stop every day. Rachel witnesses something unusual in the lives of her familiars the day before the wife in that couple goes missing, and from there we are catapulted into a story where we are presented with a host of characters we begin to think we know...only to learn we do not really know them at all. I won't lay out the plot lines or divulge any spoilers here. This book is a great little character study that benefits most from its razor-sharp economy of language, addressing all the dark layers of human existence with a very effective minimalism, and also succeeds due to its disturbingly simple premise that we never truly know what anyone around us is capable of doing at any given moment, we cannot imagine the inner lives, the internal struggles that those around us face beneath the facade of everyday platitudes. That lady down the street may be cheating on her husband or plotting revenge on a colleague or a clinically depressed addict just as easily as she may be a good samaritan or a devoted mother or a volunteer at the food bank. And she may even be all of these things at once. The capacity for others to be able to deceive us also depends on our capacity to deceive ourselves. There were a couple of minor issues I had with the book, but they did not detract much from my enjoyment of its quick prose and nasty little twists and turns. What bothered me most was Rachel herself, but that's actually a testament to the author, because Rachel is supposed to bother me. She is a troubled desperate woman, an alcoholic, obsessed with her ex-husband and her old life, and truly her own worst enemy. In fact, I kind of wonder if the train imagery that persists in the book is also meant to represent the ""train wreck"" of a woman that Rachel has become. There were several moments in the book when Rachel would fall into another bad habit or desperately serial call someone, and I wanted to crawl into the pages and take the cell phone away from her or stop her from making some new boneheaded mistake. But Rachel has to be this way, for purposes of the storyline and for purposes of lulling us into yet another preconception. The only real stumbling point for me with this book was that I figured out the big reveal long before it happened. Very close to the beginning of the book, in fact. And that took a bit of the fun out of it, because I do like a book that can surprise me, and I would have liked to have been wrong. Many readers claimed not to have seen it coming, though, and I envy them that morsel of satisfaction. Somehow, even knowing did not diminish my enjoyment of the book or my compulsion to try to read as much of it in one sitting as possible. The untangling of the story's many deceptions and misconceptions, the realization of the true natures of their ""familiars,"" is really a journey that the characters themselves have to take, a reveal that they ultimately have to uncover, whether we know where this train is going or not.

805,Stephen,"really enjoyed this dark thriller through the eyes of 3 women Rachel, megan and anna as it seems we don't always know the person close to us, reminded me more of a sj Watson book with the hidden memories which return over time as the books head in many twists and turns to a chilling finale "
806,Jessi Jones,"I had a hard time putting this book down; I was prepared to shirk all responsibilities to make sure that I finished it. Fortunately, I didn't have to and I finished it anyways.I love a good murder story; after years of watching CSI and other crime shows, I relish in a chance to try to solve the case along side the character(s) and to come up with as many theories as possible to see which is correct. The Girl on the Train was great because it made me second guess my theories and even though the truth was one of my theories, I was still surprised by the ending.This is a good read for anyone looking for suspense, a reason to stay sober and be observant, or a reason to not obsess over other people's lives."
807,Teijo Aflecht,"I have to say I'm pretty tired of reading reviewers saying they didn't find a single character likable, as if this somehow devalues a book. Would you like some ice cream with your fairy tale? As long as the characters are well written and the story holds together, as they definitely are and do in The Girl on the Train, heap all the evil shit and fucked up human beings on me you can. Besides, there is plenty of beauty in the book, although it's often nostalgic and not the convenient feel-good type.It is a complex story with if not always complex at least very human characters. Not a book that is easy to put into a single sentence, although for many it will inevitably begin with ""It's kind of like Gone Girl..."" As a thriller, which to be fair I have limited experience with, it was a page-turner to uncover what the hell happened, I was very much in sync with the puzzlement of the characters. The reveal was slow and I was literally saying ""No fucking way"" in disbelief. Good use of foreshadowing, which I picked up none of, mainly because of the complex way that the story is told. That could get too confusing for some, I suppose, I just took it in and kept going.The characters reflect different ways of living a life rather well. Especially when my perspective started shifting towards the end, it became what I thought was a good exploration of gender roles. There was fairly little humour, but around the middle I couldn't help starting to laugh at the short indignant, righteous Anna chapters whether they were intended as such or not. Not a lot of jokes though, just some self-denigrating ones that I can think of.It wasn't a very emotional read, as I suppose thrillers often aren't, although Hawkins' writing is a little more aesthetic and the story more tragic than, say, Gillian Flynn's (see, I managed to hold off until the end). I still sympathized with most of the characters at certain points.The ending was perhaps a little too fast and simple. Also slightly unbelievable as far as physique as described in the book goes. I was also hoping a character would redeem themselves in a different way, although that would have been fairly stereotypical as well. Still, resolving the story in a unique way would have been difficult, so I suppose a decent ending is better than a bad one. "
808,R.S. Carter,"I can see why so many people have likened this book to Gone Girl. There is some psychological craziness going on as well as a cast of characters who really suck. And I mean that they all have major issues with about as much likability as a fat tick. Also like Gone Girl, total page turner.If you haven't read it yet, I would say this would be a really great beach read. It's disturbing, but it won't be too heavy on the ol' cranium."
809,Phoebe Fox,"This would easily have gotten five stars from me--great writing, and I really loved how Hawkins uses an unreliable and even unlikable narrator (all of the narrators are unreliable actually) and teases out more and more info as we read, so that the story peels like an onion as we go. As many readers have said, at a certain point the tension and suspense are at such a clip that you can't stop turning pages.But the end--much as I LOVED that I didn't see the main plot twist coming--was less compelling and real to me than the rest. It was exciting, yes, but it felt like a big Hollywood showdown ending tacked onto what had been a very honest book, and while I couldn't predict anything about the plot as I read most of the book, by the end events felt rote to me. Still good, still a satisfying ending, but the rest was so exquisite I hoped for more. But I'll be reading more of her work--Hawkins does a LOT while seemingly telling a straightforward story, a very deep pool under its placid surface."
810,Bianca,"A fabulous psychological thriller full of unreliable narrators and a murder mystery that may not have you guessing until the very end, but will still have you glued to each page as the truth is revealed. Recommend."
811,Agus York ,Wow. No me lo esperaba. Me gustó aunque me molesta un poco lo mismo que en Gone girl me molestó MUCHISIMO: Lo largo que es el libro sin necesidad! Está bien que ayuda a crear cierto suspenso pero ya tanto relleno es un poco absurdo. Por suerte no era tan aburrido de leer como gone girl. Esperemos que la peli este buena :)
812,Cathy Williams,This was a true page turner. I read this book quickly because I was trying to figure out all of the mysteries involved. Highly recommend.
813,Mimi,"4.5 stars The is best thriller in this genre I've read in a very long time! ....and refreshingly different in the way the suspense unfolds like a puzzle as we try to figure out the truth of the situation from the point of views of those with impaired perceptions of reality.I really wasn't a fan of ""Gone Girl"", particularly the book's conclusion. However, despite the fact that ""The Girl on the Train"" has been compared to ""Gone Girl"", the only similarities I really see are the fact that they are both thrillers, they are both similar in prose style, and they both involve a ""missing person"" and domestic strife. However, the plot itself for me is quite different and the ultimate payoff was more satisfying.Like a high-speed train ride, this book is an enjoyable, fast-paced thriller with plot twists galore, told from the perspective of three very human, very flawed women, who have to face issues such as depression, addiction, infidelity and other domestic strife. What interested me the most was Rachel's present-tense perspective as a troubled alcoholic with blacked-out episodes that she is trying to uncover while coming to grips with herself as well as the central crime here. The author does an amazing job bringing the alcoholic mind into the forefront while keeping me on the edge of my seat as I raced through this story."
814,Roanna,"Ah, this was such an addictive read! ❤ #Recommended"
815,Diane S ⛄,"This was the last book read that I needed to complete my yearly challenge and it was fantastically suspenseful. More so when you consider that it is the authors first thriller. Rachel is a hot mess, a shadow of her former shelf. Her husband has left her for another woman and they now have a child, a child Rachel wanted more than anything. Turning to drink, she has become an ugly drunk, lost her job, gained weight and doesn't remember what she has done, often blacking out.She takes the same train, at the same time that she too when she has a job, not wanting anyone to know she has been fired. She has a good reason to look out the windows of the train and this is how she becomes embroiled in a turn of events that will have a huge impact on her life.I felt a reluctant sympathy for Rachel, she is so totally flawed, seemingly unable to help herself. The suspense and the characters were amazingly portrayed. Often I had no idea what was going to happen next, things kept changing, going in a different direction. Reminded me somewhat of Alfred Hitchcock with his unique camera pans, only this author does the same thing but with words. I have train tracks about 50 yards behind my house but thank goodness it is only for freight, if it was passenger train I think I would be extremely self conscious about what I was doing in my yard.Highly recommend for psychological and suspense thriller, readers.Arc from librarything. "
816,Kate Maxcy,"A psychological thriller, this book will reel you in to its unraveling plot line and twists, and the characters' twisted, entertaining thoughts."
817,Katya,"4.0 Stars!!I was glued to the page....You open the book and know in the first sentence that someone was murdered. The narrator is calm, un-effected by what he/she has done and logical. But we see the story though the eyes of Rachel, who rides the train to and from each day by a neighborhood she studies and watches...and imagines things about the people she watches. She goes as far as to name them. Then one day she sees something odd....But Rachel is not the most reliable witness and she has a pack of her own troubles. Does she step forward and say something or stay out of it? I was spellbound at the end. It was if I could see it being played out in a movie. How would this be fixed? How could it end and not end badly? Would there be justice or horror?A really good novel....I can see the movie already! Worth the read."
818,Kim Kaso,"Talk about your unreliable narrators, and hard to sympathize with her, as well. But once I got a chapter or so in, however, I was well and truly hooked, and kept turning pages, finishing it within a day. The device of her drinking worked to keep the reader in suspense, while also making this reader want to march her to the nearest rehab facility. "
819,Gillian,"I am not a Mystery girl, but if you liked Gone Gone you will like this. I bought it because Paul Hawkins is from Harare :) "
820,Dee-Ann,I did not like the characters in this book. I found Rachel frustratingly too realistic and pitiful. The mystery got to me though and suspense.
821,Denise,"This was a fun, crazy read for the summer where all the characters are flawed and kind of sad, especially the heroine, but it works for an entertaining page turner, whodunit. I think it got a thumbs up from everyone in my book club. Lots of wine flowed between the pages and at book club!! "
822,Clare Flynn,"My next door neighbour passed me a copy of this over the garden fence. Quite appropriate really as this psychological thriller takes places in London's outer suburbs and one wonders what the other occupants of Blenheim Road were doing while the events of this book were unfolding - lots of running into gardens screaming and despite the fact that an unsolved murder has taken place people seem to come and go without curtains twitching! I also found Rachel's situation a bit hard to swallow -despite her alcohol issues it seems odd that she would be left with not a brass farthing from her divorce while hubby and his new wife keeps house and furniture. Odd that neither her mum nor her friend Cathy suggested a good divorce lawyer! Those quibbles aside, I really enjoyed this. It is a page turner and Hawkins throws plenty of spoilers in to keep you guessing - although I did have a pretty good idea who the killer was, she did mix it up quite a bit and fed out the clues gradually. She also writes well - a spare style - all first person but 3 POVs. Even though the main character, Rachel, is a booze soaked wreck for most of the novel, puking on her flatmate's stairs, falling down in the street, pissing herself and slugging back an unhealthy mix of different drinks, I did find I quite liked her and felt sympathy for her. As the story progresses it becomes easier to root for her - even though she is her own worst enemy. What I particularly liked was the way the book unfolds with Rachel watching Blenheim Road from the carriage of a train, imagining the lives of the people she sees in one of the houses. How many of us have done exactly that as our trains are held up at a signal and we peer into the back gardens of terraced houses wondering about the lives of the occupants?"
823,Claire Mackin,"A quick read, a bit of a psychological puzzle. Unlike other reviewers, Rachel's personality flaws made her more real and believable to me. I don't need to LIKE her to appreciate her. The author knit an interesting web of characters and relationships, and until the end I didn't know who the killer was. I think the story could have benefited from another layer and a few of the characters, Anna in particular, could have been more dimensional. It left me wishing for something more, thus I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. But for a fun, weekend read, I recommend it. "
824,Joca,A minha opinião em vídeo ;)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0tfl...
825,Vanessa Fenn,"I stayed up until 11:30 last night to finish this book- and that is saying something for me!Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning. Every day she rattles down the track, flashes past a stretch of cozy suburban homes, and stops at the signal that allows her to daily watch the same couple breakfasting on their deck. She’s even started to feel like she knows them. “Jess and Jason,” she calls them. Their life—as she sees it—is perfect. Not unlike the life she recently lost.And then she sees something shocking. It’s only a minute until the train moves on, but it’s enough. Now everything’s changed. Unable to keep it to herself, Rachel offers what she knows to the police, and becomes inextricably entwined in what happens next, as well as in the lives of everyone involved. Has she done more harm than good?A compulsively readable, emotionally immersive, Hitchcockian thriller that draws comparisons to Gone Girl, The Silent Wife, or Before I Go to Sleep, this is an electrifying debut embraced by readers across markets and categories. "
826,Claire Peal,Brilliant
827,Delee,"4.5Here we are 3 years after the release of Gone Girl- and every twisty turny page turning novel is STILL being compared. THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN is no exception...but that was not what caught my attention. What persuaded me??? Train...Witness to murder...Hitchcock...Rear Window. Those words will get me almost every time...Rachel is depressed, angry, and bitter. Gin and tonic- is her drink of choice- Wine comes in at a close second. Every day she takes the slow train from Asbury to Euston...and everyday it slows to a stop and she sees ""Jason and Jess"". The ""perfect couple"". A couple who just by watching them every day- gives her hope that happiness exists...Rachel is stuck clinging to the days she had with her ex-husband Tom- who left because of her drinking...who left her for a younger woman. A younger version of her- drama free...and a woman who now has Tom's baby. A baby that Rachel could never give him....The only relief from her dreary, pointless, life is ""Jess and Jason""...(not their real names of course)...but very real for her all the same. Then one day Rachel witnesses something that doesn't seem right...something that involves a woman named Megan- the woman who she thought of as ""Jess"". And now Jess/Megan is missing...So far this is my favorite book from this year- YES, it has a lot of hype surrounding it- but don't let that get in the way of picking it up. :D"
828,Megasaurus,"I really didn't want to like this book. It's just so, insanely popular right now. I just wanted to be that person that could look down her nose and say something distasteful about its literary merits. Doesn't matter. I was so involved with each unreliable character and I absolutely loved every second of it. YESSSS!Full review to come... eventually"
829,Sadaf Matinkhoo,"This was one of the few crime/thriller books that I've ever read, and it was amazing! I wonder if someone is making a movie based on it cuz it would be even better than Gone Girl!I liked that in spite of being a thriller, the characters -specially Rachel- were skillfully developed and the emotional elements were very relatable. The plot was very interesting and the writing fluent. Overall, a very non-cheesy-ly entertaining book!"
830,Grant,"excellent mystery. well laid out, and the clues were just enough to make it possible for everybody to have done it! Good to the end. Tom and Rachel, the drunk. Then Tom and Anna, the mistress he married and had a baby, Evie, Megan, the hot blond with a past seen and observed from the train, her husband Scott, the hot headed and loving broken hearted widow, and that mysterious man with the red hair. Then there is Kamal, the compromised shrink. Could have been anyone.Loved the healing that takes place in the life of the (well-portrayed)alcoholic, and all of the doubts and self doubting that is part of the personality.Well Done.Thanks, Randee."
831,Patricia,"Very well written - a page turner. The ending wasn't a complete surprise, but the writing kept me enthralled. Would definitely recommend this boook to mystery lovers!"
832,Mimansa Bairathi,"Rachel, ""the girl on the train"" is an alcoholic who is still recovering from her two year old divorce. Travelling from home to work on a train, she recreates the perfectly happily married life and superimposes it onto the people she witnesses during the journey. However, this vicarious happiness proves to be shortlived in the wake of a mysterious disappearance. And Rachel feels she is the key to solving the mystery.The book is about secrets and all the characters are hiding something. The result being, every character has the feeling of being watched in their own homes atlas one. While one secret after another unfolds, Rachel feels that she has the key to solving the mystery if only her memory would come back.It isn't a very complex plot, but the beauty lies in its simplicity. The book has a pacy plot and not a single word would seem superfluous. One of the best reads of this year and certainly worth a read. This is Rachel's journey from being an ""unreliable witness"" to becoming a sober, calm and mature individual."
833,M (RAIN CITY READS),"Hawkins has a gift for drawing characters so heartbreakingly real that you'll be squirming in your seat. She also set the scene flawlessly and with great detail. The result was that for the first several chapters of the book, there's only subtle foreshadowing of the foul play to come. I started wondering - was this really a thriller? Or was the mystery something less immediately life-and-death and more a matter of personal discovery?Then, all of a sudden, there it was. Except also there it wasn't. This book doesn't progress the way most thrillers do. Usually a thriller starts with a little bit of background or scene-setting, followed by a description of the crime, and then you get to know the people in the victim's life as the author slowly teases out possible motives. This book was the other way around. It slowly wound itself around and up to the salient event. At which point Hawkins turned the entire story on its head.It isn't at all like Gone Girl in terms of the specifics, but the feel of it was similar. The more you learn about these characters, the less you feel like you know them. And again, they become less and less likeable. I didn't dislike them anywhere near as much as the characters in Gone Girl, but my opinions of them definitely shifted as I read.The plot itself was good - not great - but good. It went off in unexpected directions, there were red herrings, there was intrigue and lots of possible outcomes. For the first 3/4 of the book, you wouldn't know it's Hawkins' first novel. Her plot development is different, sure, but that's a good thing. I liked not knowing what to expect, and I lost myself in her words. I found that, though I was okay with the ending, there were bits towards the end of the book that struck me as a bit unrealistic. It was as if either the author tried too hard not to give anything away, or had planned one conclusion, changed her mind, and then went back and forced the pieces to fit in with a new one. There weren't quite enough bread crumbs along the way, and a little less foreshadowing than I would have liked. The ending still worked, but I would have preferred the scene being slightly better set for this particular outcome. I finished this book nearly a week ago, but it's still popping into my head. I find myself wondering how the characters got on after the book ended, what they'd do next if the story continued. This is the sign of a good book. Though the thriller aspect was definitely good, the writing is what really stood out. It's rare to find such depth and beauty in a book centered primarily around suspense, let alone in a debut.I'm glad this book kicked off my reading for 2015. It reminded me what good writing feels like when you lose yourself in it, and left me feeling haunted and yet wanting more. Was it perfect? No. But I'll be first in line for Paula Hawkins' next book, because if this debut is anything to go by, she's one to watch.Read the full review on BACKLIST BOOKS."
834,Madeline,"Nice neo-du Maurier.This is a story told in three voices: Rachel, an active alcoholic - down on her luck, unemployed, unhappy, hopeful/delusional; Megan, a housewife with problems (some more surprising than others, shall we say) and whose disappearance gives shape to the novel; Anna, a housewife and young mother with the kind of terrifying narrow vision you sometimes see in people with young children (although, to be fair, it certainly looks like Anna's had that narrowness and self-absorption for some time).I really enjoy the Daphne du Maurie novel My Cousin Rachel, which, if you haven't read it or seen the film adaptation (with Olivia de Havilland and Richard Burton), I won't spoil for you. But, I was reminded, reading The Girl on the Train of that book, because there are so many marriages and failed marriages - and because there are so many houses to be taken over, or stubbornly resisted. And because at the center of the novel is a mystery about a woman, about how good that woman is and how trustworthy.But this is also a bit like Rebecca, because if you can't trust the women in The Girl on the Train, you sure as shit can't trust the men. And like Gaslight. (I recommend the 1940 film, by the way, because although I think it it less polished than the 1944 adaptation, Anton Walbrook is much scarier than Charles Boyer. That's not quite what you'd expect, either.)I liked this so much more than Gone Girl. Partly for a couple of totally unfair reasons like, probably, I like British writers more than Americans (I think, actually, that's not true? but I've never done the math) and that TGOTT just came out and I read GG like three years after it was published. And that's always a weird thing to do: ""read this novel everyone was really into like three years ago!!!!!!"" But REALLY, the reason I like Hawkins' book so much - I should say, though, it almost lost me a few times because I am very susceptible to second hand embarrassment - is that it doesn't explain its themes or ideas to you the way that GG does. I know that is part of the conceit of the characters: that they are ""cleverer than everyone else"" and so they're condescending to explain, like, gender dynamics and gender performance. But Rachel, for example, is a total mystery to herself. And she spends her narrative, mostly, wrapped up in the experience of being herself, and lamenting it - not analyzing or explaining it. When she goes to a therapist, then, she tells us things we know or have gleaned, but there is something really welcome and wonderful about her speaking those things to someone else, to someone who can answer. And Anna is like Lucy Steele or something - a monster of self-absorption and self-deception.I don't know if Hawkins was thinking about du Maurier when she wrote this; probably not - I don't think people evoke her as a model right now. But I would be really happy to read more books in the du Maurier tradition. Are there more on the way?"
835,Johnny Williams,"Well well-- as I began this book which everyone was reading-- I thought perhaps I had lost my mind! I couldn't keep up with the different dates - voices-- and jibber jabber. In fact I started to put it in the recycle bin-then after about 5 or 6 chapters I finally realized this was Ms Hawkins exasperating style. She meant to keep us guessing as she ran us through false alleys-- confused us with suspects, amnesia albeit drunk main characters-- I thought this was a rehash of Gone Girl -- but wa la I liked it once I caught on to the characters and the trip the author was taking me on. The author although not as good as Gone Girl is surely unique in the story telling and she keeps us on our toes as we seek clues and try and figure this mind bender out--- what a storyteller "
836,Clara Cortés,omg
837,b00k r3vi3ws,"I got this book from Audible and listened to the audiobook over a period of a week. It was an incredible experience for someone who is a newbie to Audiobooks.Rachel is a divorcee, who travels by the same train every day. As she passes by her old home, she soon becomes enamored by a couple living down a couple of houses. To her, they seem like the perfect couple who are in love with each other. But one day she sees the girl with another man and soon after the girl goes missing. When Rachel gets the news, she feels like she needs to help find the girl. She tells the police what she knows, but they do not take her seriously. That’s when Rachel decides to take some action on her own and the story starts to unfold.This is such an awesome and horrifying novel. Each and every character in it, much like real life, is flawed. There were moments when I felt like shaking a character till she saw sense and then there were moments where I was too horrified. Rachel, the narrator, is so unreliable because of her drinking habits that half the time I was left wondering if she had been hallucinating about some of the things. She came off all wrong at the beginning and I couldn’t figure out why the author would put her in the forefront of the novel. It took me sometime and it was way past the first half of the story that I managed to warm up to her.It took me some time to really get the hang of the story (not necessarily because of the writing but mostly because I am yet to get used to listening to audiobooks) but once I got into it, I could hardly stop listening. (Unfortunately real life does seem to get in the way as does the lure of print books.) The language used is opulent and the narration style that gives us the story from three POVs is really interesting. The plot was really engrossing. The mystery had me going back on forth on who the murderer could be. Some of the red herrings really had me going in circles and the climax was worth all the buildup.The narrators - Louise Brealey, Clare Corbett and India Fisher – have done a great job in bringing the characters alive. I am still not sure about who narrated which character, but they were a perfect fit. It was almost like I could feel the characters and their emotions through their narration.Awesome!"
838,Jill Sayre,"Was a fun read. I looked forward to picking it up to read every day. A bit like a drunk Bridget Jones, Rachel made many decisions that made me cringe, but it is a very forward-moving novel and kept me interested. I can see this story as a movie."
839,Jonas,"So I just finished this book in little more than a day and I have to say - what a journey!The storytelling is shared by four girls, all of whom perceive facts and events in a different light and while reading one quickly notices that no one storyteller can be trusted to tell the whole story.I personally also enjoyed the imagery of Rachel, one of the narrators who's an alcoholic and lost her job while still fake-commuting into the city everyday switches from observer on the train to an acting persona and vice versa. I actually also recognized a lot of myself in this book, isn't it true that we all sometimes think we know somebody just by seeing them regularly, having developed a sophisticated image in our mind that we struggle to fit to the actual person once we learn some detail that doesn't quite fit the picture? Don't all of us sometimes have a tendency to go overboard a little, letting one white lie lead to another to cover an awkward truth?The plot itself was also quite well narrated, although for me the special magic of this book lay in its way of telling the story. The plot had some slight leaps that made me reconsider my 5-star-rating and settling for a comfortable 4-star - not a life-changer, but would definitely read again and recommend!"
840,Jim Dooley,"After reading many favorable comparisons between this book and the tension of a fine Hitchcock movie, I had to put this one on my reading list. If there is a Hitchcock comparison, it is probably closer to SHADOW OF A DOUBT or STRANGERS ON A TRAIN. Also, instead of a blissfully innocent central character who is caught up in sinister doings, we have a deeply flawed central character who keeps putting herself in harm’s way.That’s not a negative, although there are some “Aw, c’mon!” moments. Mostly, this is a brisk read with interesting characters and a number of plot twists that would keep the popcorn munchers happy if the story was filmed.Who did it? In all honesty, I believe that most mystery fans will have a very good idea by midway through the book. What will be less obvious (but not too difficult to solve) is why it was done, and part of the fun is piecing together the logic behind the events.One device that I found to be distracting was giving different characters separate chapter headings and then following the story from their unique point-of-view. As we near the ending, events are happening quickly and the trade-off between character narrations…while not stopping the action…does require a momentary reorientation. I would have found a more linear method of storytelling more to my liking, especially as I’m not a big fan of flashbacks…and there are a lot of flashbacks in this tale.All of that said, the type of person who goes to see a Hitchcock thriller is not expecting a P.D. James depth of analysis and development. If you like your mystery thrillers brisk and exciting, you should enjoy this one."
841,"Jay, Queen Queen",One of my favorite thrill novels so far. I had so many theories about the killer and I was mind blown at the end.
842,Launa Faulkner,"it's not that often that a book draws you in from the first chapter and you can't put it down. yes the characters are dark and disturbed...which only adds to the aura. the author really developed the characters well because I couldn't stand Rachel's weakness. the reader is only allowed to see her from one person's perspective, then we are given a broader view like a zoomed lens retracting and showing us the bigger picture. really well crafted piece of fiction."
843,Lilian,"""Und wie kamen sie in den Garten?"" ""Ich bin über den Zaun gestiegen. Ich wusste ja, wie man in den Garten kommt..."" ""Sie sind also über den Zaun geklettert, um sich Zutritt zum Haus ihres Exmanns zu verschaffen?"".Alles beginnt damit das wir mit Rachel Zug fahren, sie hat ihre festen Zeiten und immer die gleiche Bahnstrecke die sie immer fährt. Jeden Tag einmal früh und dann abends wieder zurück, manchmal bleibt der Zug stehen und sie kann einen Blick auf ein Paar in einem der Häuser am Bahngleis, werfen. Sie hat ihnen längst Namen gegeben und ihnen eine eigene Geschichte angedichtet.Zu Beginn merken wir auch gleich was mit Rachel los ist, sie ist schwer Alkoholsüchtig und manchmal wirkt es so als könne sie das was tatsächlich passiert nicht mehr mit ihren Vorstellungen auseinanderhalten. Ganz ehrlich, bei Rachel dauerte es ein wenig bis ich sie leiden konnte. Sie ist eher die untypische Romanheldin; sehr oft betrunken, lässt sich gehen und wie soll ich sagen, sie gilt als Versagerin. Doch je mehr wir von ihr lesen desto mehr lernen wir sie kennen und verstehen. Erst nach und nach wird ihr Handlen klar. Ich wurde leider nicht richtig mit ihr warm, aber sie wurde mir sympathischer.Aber auch die anderen Charaktere sind nicht ohne, da wäre Megan die ein nach außen hin perfektes Leben zu führen scheint, doch auch hier ist es mehr Schein als sein. Sie hat Schlafstörungen und leidet unter einer Art Trauma. Auch ihre Persönlichkeit hat mich etwas verwundert, sie wirkte nicht wie das brave Mädel von nebenan.Weiter geht es mit Anna, der Frau von Rachels Ex Tom. Sie scheint ein Bilderbuch Famlienleben zu haben, und leidet unter Rachels ständigen Anrufen. Ihr Mann Tom nimmt das eher gelassen. Immer wieder versucht er Rachel zu beschwichtigen. So richtig durchsetzen kann sich Anna nicht und überhaupt wirkte sie die ganze Zeit eher inaktiv und nicht besonders stark.Es tauchen noch weitere Charaktere auf wie Andy und Scott die geschickt in die Handlung eingewoben wurden. Bei beiden hätte ich mir jedoch gewünscht das noch ein wenig mehr auf sie eingegangen würde. Ebenso der Therapeut, der auch eine Rolle zu spielen hatte.Was mir persönlich gut gefallen hat war das die Handlung aus Rachel, Anna und Megans jeweiligen Sichtweisen gezeigt wurden und so der Handlung Spannung und Dichte verliehen haben. Am Buchanfang war die Handlung noch eine langsame Reise die dann immer mehr an Fahrt aufgenommen hat. Man konnte prima miträtseln und ich muss sagen, ich habe den wahren Täter nicht erkannt.Zum Schreibstil kann ich nur soviel sagen; das Buch liest sich leicht und flüssig und die gekonnten Wendungen haben der Handlung viel Spannung verliehen. Die Zugfahrt war gut beschrieben, man fühlte sich immer wie einer der Passagiere.Wer Spannung und eine gut entwickelte Handlung sucht der kann bei Girl on the Train beherzt zugreifen. Das es nicht gleich offensichtlich war wer den nun der Täter war hat mir sehr gefallen. Weniger toll fand ich die ständigen Alkoholszenen weswegen ich dem Buch einen Punkt abziehe.Das fand ich zwar menschlich aber nicht schön.In einem Satz: Spannender Thriller mit einer etwas anderen HeldinGirl on the Train erhält 4 von 5 Sternen"
844,Brandy Giles,I really enjoyed this book. If my family hadn't been visiting I probably would have read it in one day because the suspense was killing me. Once you get about halfway through the book the ending becomes pretty apparent but I didn't enjoy it any less
845,Dorothy Paul-Vela,"I enjoyed this read, there was a point where I felt like the book was repeating itself and I was just rereading previous chapters. although, once I passed that point it was gripping and exciting. I couldn't put it down! and the ending was great!"
846,Linda Broussard,Couldn't put this one down. The main character is a flawed and broken woman with an obsession who tries to unravel a mystery. Loved it!
847,Dena Mehling,"My kind of book! Flawed characters, suspense and a little action. A page turner that I really enjoyed. "
848,Constance,"This is not horror, but it is perhaps the most terrifyingly claustrophobic books I have ever read. Something bad has happened, something bad is going to happen. The Girl on the Train of the title is a witness to - something - but she is also an alcoholic, a binge drinker subject to blackouts. She can't remember quite what she's seen, she can't remember what she's done, but she knows it's bad, and no one will believe her because no one believes a drunk, a rubbernecker, a failure. This book is a testament to people making choices and the legacy of those choices. The drama, the suspense, of this book revolves around whether the characters can right those choices in time to save themselves. Readers will root for these flawed but believable characters with baited breath. "
849,Tayanna Daliese,"I have a lot of feelings, but I think if I would stop reading books that are really similar to this, I wouldn't be as hard on it. So I'll pretend like I haven't and give it a 4 instead of the 3 I would normally. I also want a book that doesn't let me know what's going on till the very end. There was one, tiny, tiny, m. night twist that also pushed it over the edge, but I did figure it out a little too soon."
850,Erin Lindsay McCabe,"This book read like an express train for me, but I still feel torn about how to rate it. I absolutely enjoyed the experience of reading it and could hardly put it down. I admire the way the story is structured--not just weaving three POV characters (three unlike-able ones at that!) and two timelines into a coherent narrative, but also the way information is concealed and revealed. it's impressive and seems like it would be incredibly challenging for an author to keep straight. But I did guess at the basic conclusion well before the end (there are really only so many possibilities) and so the ending maybe didn't have the impact it should have. For all the aspects I can admire about the book, I still felt a bit disappointed upon finishing. I think that's because the reading experience was one of pure entertainment, rather than one of insight, emotional resonance, and meaning. But probably one doesn't really read thrillers for that kind of experience, right?"
851,Carolyn,"Great quick read - slightly choppy with the timelines in the beginning but not a problem! As the story unfolded I couldn't put it down and the ending took me slightly by surprise. As soon as I finished, Two Black Cadillacs popped in my head. Thumbs up! "
852,Gulzar Choudhury,"An amazingly gripping thriller that keeps the readers glued to the plot guessing right to the last page in spite of having enough scattered clues. I'm impressed with it's lucid manner of narratives how the whole story gets it's shape surrounding the day-to-day activities of a female protagonist. I'm not sure whether it can perfectly be called a psychological thriller (my experience with this genre is very limited) but this is simply an un-put-down-able thriller with lots of violence, blood shedings, jealousy, betrayal, love, depression, alcohol, murder and what not. Overall, this is a pretty much appreciative work considering the fact that it's the first novel by this author (I mean authoress!) and I'm looking forward for much more page turners like this from Paula Hawkins."
853,Simona Stoica,"Un roman captivant, pe care cu greu il lasi din mana. O calatorie cu trenul... care pare fara sfarsit :D.„Viaţa nu e un paragraf şi moartea nu e ceva între paranteze.”http://palarisme.ro/chef/carti/72-car..."
854,Monica Miller,"I literally couldn't leave it aside when I reached the last 100 pages.It was so well written and everyone seemed suspect, I didn't even know what to think, I mean I had a hunch ever since the beginning, and it turned out I was right, but I did question it a lot of times.I loved that Rachel wasn't the kind of girl you root for or you completely love, but a normal person with flaws (and a lot of them).Anna was such an annoying character, she had zero self esteem, and she was so cruel and heartless. I hated her."
855,Becky Motew,"A ripping good read that I drank down in 24 hours. A bit too much weeping and lamenting for my taste, but I was hooked from the beginning. Any book that can do that gets 4 stars from me."
856,Veronica Devon,"My taste in books tends to lean toward the darkly fantastical kind. This was reinforced the other day when a woman came into the library looking for a ""light read about women, family, and relationships,"" and I struggled to think of something that wasn't about a psychological murderer, punk rock, or supernatural happenings (In the end, I did find something. Nothing I've read, though it was highly recommended by the general public and Kirkus). Essentially, I love it when plots are messy and filled with imperfect characters.Well, The Girl on the Train has all of these things, including three delightfully unreliable narrators: Rachel, a divorced alcoholic who cannot seem to let go of her past life; Megan, a woman in an unhappy marriage who has an affair with her therapist; and Anna, the woman who stole Rachel's husband. The story spills out at an even pace, which practically forces you to keep reading. Is it the next Gone Girl? Maybe."
857,Katie Bea,"I have wanted to read this book since it was released and was ecstatic when my boyfriend bought it for me. I enjoyed the twists and turns and how you get pulled into each characters lives and start to really feel their emotions. I was expecting more from this book when I read about it but I still think that it had the right amount of romance, thriller and drama in there to keep you reading and not once make you think 'like hell that would happen'. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a bit of thrill and mystery. *The period in which it took for me to read this book in no way reflects what I thought of it; I just have no spare time to read full chapters at once however annoying that may be.*"
858,Erin Logan,"Rachel's train stops in front of the same house every day on her morning commute, and she feels almost as if she knows the couple who lives there. When she spots another man in the garden, then the woman goes missing Rachel feels the need to get involved in a potentially dangerous situation. The story is heightened by Rachel's lack of reliability as a narrator, and murder, lies, deceit, infidelity come into play from many characters.I needed a break from AY novels, so I chose this newer title. I LOVED IT! I love how unreliable Rachel is and how the story not only changes points of view but also does not follow a completely linear time table. If you enjoy books about deception, jealousy, and mystery with a touch of unstable characters, this one is for you. I would not suggest this book to young readers but would put it in the hands of many of my adult friends who read and loved Gone Girl."
859,Matt Kays,"Here's the thing, Gillian Flynn cannot write books as fast as I can read them. When something pops up as the next ""Gone Girl"" and the reviews start rolling in saying it actually could be, my interest explodes. Entertainment Weekly has said that there is a whole slew of books coming out this year in this vein and I truly can't wait to read them all. Like Flynn's novels, The Girl on The Train is full of really depressing and unlikable characters, which makes it even more intense when you get to that inevitable point in these type of stories when you have to choose which side you want to take and who you want to believe. I'm obviously not going to talk about the twists and turns, of which there are many, or the fact that had I slowed down a bit and not read this in a day I might have seen the big reveal coming. In all honesty though, I wasn't even trying to figure it out, I was along for the ride. And what a fast and thrilling ride it was. "
860,Stephenee,"I thought that this book started out really slow - there were times that I wasn't sure that I was going to be able to finish it, however, after the first 180 pages or so it picked up and was much easier to read. I enjoyed the ending of the book much more than the beginning of it or even the middle of it. It did keep me guessing who had done it - and I was a bit surprised by the outcome, however, this book was a bit over-rated by the media and was a let down on that front. It has been repeatedly compared to Gone Girl and to be honest I never once thought of Gone Girl while reading it. An ok - book but wait for paperback or the library to get it in."
861,Kelli Oliver George,"My No Spoiler Review:Does this deserve the comparison to Gone Girl? Yes. Yes it does. However, it deserves the comparison not because the plots are alike (I would argue they are quite different) but rather, because this was a fun, quick romp of a psychological thriller. Just like Gone Girl.Honestly? I guessed what the twist was going to be around page 94 (I marked my place there out of curiosity to see if I was correct). However! Even guessing the twist made this no less enjoyable of a read and I still zipped right through to get to the end (knowing the twist does not mean you will guess the ending). Even better? The twist is NOT contrived and the author did not throw it in there out of the blue. The author alludes to the twist throughout the book and she does it quite well.Such a fun, yummy read that I could hardly put down! And bonus -- we have not one, not two, but THREE narrators -- and it is up to the reader to determine who is reliable. Delicious!"
862,Mollie,"Oh, this was a good read. We picked it for our book club because pretty much all of us had added it to our ""to-read"" lists, though I probably would have read it anyway. It was super readable, compelling and with enough mystery to keep those pages turning. It's funny, because while I was reading it, I thought it was all believable and very clever, but in retrospect, some of it kind of had me scratching my head, and feeling a little bit tricked, which is kind of sucky. It made for a great read, but some of the ""big reveals"" seem like they would be impossible.Because this book would be kind of a bummer to read if you know what happens, I'm hiding the rest. Consider yourself warned.(view spoiler)[All the comparisons to Gone Girl are fair - it's similarly readable and the narrator is not very reliable. And I think because I had heard those comparisons so much, I was deeply suspicious of everyone, and what everyone said. The one person I wasn't suspicious of was Tom, the husband, the guy who ended up being the bad guy. And that, I think, is pretty impressive, though in retrospect it was largely because of some rather implausible situations, namely: why did he only beat up Rachel when she was black out drunk? And how did he know she was black out drunk? That is just weird. It seems like abusers wouldn't wait until that was the situation to be abusive, though I guess maybe was more like a psycho/sociopath type rather than a typical abusive husband. But, I don't know, it seems like a stretch to me. This was kind of a sub-problem of the broader one: all the red herrings. Red herrings are part of mysteries, and I know that, but in this case, a lot of them didn't otherwise get explained. Why on earth did Scott lock Rachel in that room? Why was he so controlling and weird with Megan? What was the deal with the creepy therapist? They didn't necessarily add anything to the plot, other than to thicken it, and again, it made me feel a little bit cheated. Or tricked. That's not the satisfying experience of ""AH HA"" that often comes from a really well constructed mystery.Rachel was a really interesting narrator. I'm not sure I've ever read a book where alcoholism is so much a part of the main character's daily life, and when it is treated as the relentless, desperate, depressing condition that it really is. There was no romanticizing, and it was incredibly frustrating to read about Rachel continually slipping.One major complaint was the horrific scene with Megan and her dead baby. I don't know why that was necessary or how it added to the story. It was just horrific, and awful.On the other hand, I thought the terrifying scene of Rachel snatching up Anna's baby was powerful and frightening, and even when Rachel sort of explained it, it was never very satisfying, and made me realise just how unstable she really was. I thought that was very effective storytelling.Anyway, four stars because WHILE I was reading it, I was really immersed. It was only in retrospect that I felt a little misled. (hide spoiler)]"
863,Maria Häggbom,"Det här var en annorlunda läsupplevelse som kanske inte riktigt är en fyra, men nära nog i alla fall. Huvudpersonen Rachel är ingen hjältinna som man ser upp till eller önskar vara, för hon är alkoholiserad, ljuger både för sig själv och för andra och lever ett liv som hon vet kan falla ihop när som helst. Hon bor på nåder hemma hos en inte särskilt nära bekant, åker iväg med pendeltåget varje morgon till ett jobb hon blivit kickad från för flera månader sedan och öppnar en flaska vin eller en burk gin och tonic ibland redan på morgonen. En av Rachels stora nöjen är att titta på husen som passerar utanför tågfönstret och det är främst ett par som fångar hennes intresse. Hon döper dem till namn hon tycker passar, ger dem intressanta yrken och komplexa personligheter. Dessutom är hon säker på att de är mycket lyckliga och älskar varandra över allt annat. Därför kommer det som en chock när hon en dag ser mannen i huset vara våldsam och någon dag senare ser hon kvinnan med en annan man. När tidningen sedan rapporterar kvinnan försvunnen vill Rachel hjälpa till, men vem skulle lyssna på henne; en alkoholiserad fluktare som har svårt att hålla isär sina egna tankar? Inte blir det lättare när paret som är föremål för utredningen bor bara några hus från Rachels ex-make och som Rachel ringer och trakasserar när hon är full. Berättelsen förmedlas genom tre olika kvinnors syn på händelseförloppet som följer: Rachel, Anna (ex-makens nya fru) och Meghan (kvinnan som försvinner). Upplösningen är oväntad och ingenting är som det verkar. "
864,Tonya,This was a book club selection for me this month. I’ll be honest I wasn’t exactly all that excited about it. I was procrastinating big time on starting it. (I’m really making this sound appealing aren’t I?) Occasionally I like to listen to audio books so I figured I’d see how this one was in audio. That way I could still read other things since I usually only listen to audio at my day job or while driving sans kiddos in the car. So I queued it up and started. I went into the book totally cold. I hadn’t read any other reviews or even the blurb. I highly recommend doing this. Don’t even research or read the back of the book. Just start it.......http://straightshootinbookreviews.com...
865,Robert Palmer,"This is the most gripping thriller that I have ever read, no doubt about it. The story is narrated by three Women, Rachel, who is drunk half the time and She's not always understandable or trustworthy,which is what happens when you are drunk, and have memory lapses. Megan and Anna, the other two Women are not the type I ,or just about anyone I know would want for friends. The three narrators will keep you guessing as you try to figure out who's behind one character's disappearance. I'm sure that this novel will be adapted for the big screen sometime next year. You must read this book! "
866,Melanie,"This book is an unforgettable thriller! Great character development, great pacing, great story! It's definitely one that gets devoured in a matter of days. There's some coarse language, but all in all a thrilling read!"
867,Viktoria,"Признаюсь сразу, что про эту книгу я узнала только после новостей об экранизации. А когда пошли слухи, что Крис Эванс и Джаред Лето оба хотят в проект, я прямо еще сильнее захотела ее прочесть. Не зря же обоих увлек сюжет?Многие сравнивают ""Девушку в поезде"" с ""Исчезнувшей"". Есть немного, но совсем капельку. Наверное, из-за этого сравнения я постоянно ждала подобного открытия, как и в ""Исчезнувшей"". Ждала подвоха, ехидности со стороны героя. Книги схожи только атмосферой. Атмосферой интриги, неопределенности и некоей темноты. Итак. Рейчел. Разведенка-алкоголичка, которая уже несколько месяцев ездит на электричке из дома в Лондон и там убивает время, потому что боится признаться своей соседке, что ее уволили с работы. Каждый раз на красном сигнале семафора она вглядывается в близ стоящие дома. И в одном из них она видит счастливых мужчину и женщину - Джейсона и Джесс, как она их называла - и постоянно выдумывает для себя истории про них: кем могла работать Джесс, чем мог заниматься Джейсон и вообще как они жили. Но недалеко стоящий от их дома дом она старалась пропускать глазами, потому что когда-то это был ее дом. Но теперь в нем живет ее бывший муж со своей новой женой и ребенком.Хочу сразу сказать, что я сопереживала героине. Она потерялась. Муж был неправ. Но об этом позже.Меган. Она же Джесс. Миниатюрная замужняя блондинка, жаждущая адреналина. Это я поняла сразу. У нее было тяжелое детство, а подростковые годы еще хлеще. Галерею, где она работала закрыли, поэтому женщина еще сильнее одичала. После ей захотелось внести разнообразия в свою жизнь. С чего все и понеслось.Анна. Бывшая любовница, теперь любимая жена с ребенком. Ее персонажа я долго не могла понять. Она вечно переживала, что Рейчел с ней что-то сделает, жила в ненависти к ней, была счастлива занять ее место рядом с Томом; после она начала сомневаться в себе и в Томе, хотя до последнего хотела остаться на его стороне. Но то, как она закончила (тот самый момент), меня удивило в ней. Правда когда она размышляла о былых временах, о том, как же она скучает о днях, когда они с Томом тайком от Рейчел встречались и занимались сексом... Эммм, ну ладно. Creepy.Скотт. Муж Меган. Ох. Я ему прям сопереживала, хотя тоже оказался темной лошадкой.Том. Бывший муж Рейчел. Хм, сколько у него было терпения, скажу я вам. Ведь Рейчел долгое время докапывалась до него своими ночными звонками и визитами по пьяни. Он все равно сопереживал и пытался ей как-то помочь. НО с этим человеком я не стала бы играть в покер. Итог. Казалось бы, три одинаково ненормальных женщины, среди которых одна алкоголичка и должна быть самой неадекватной. Но в итоге алкоголичка оказалась нормальным человеком, а те две совсем не в себе. Одной нравилось быть чьей-то любовницей, отчего она кайфовала, а другой нужен был адреналин, нужно было срочно с кем-то переспать на стороне, потому что ее горячий муж ее не впечатлял. Мда, товарищи. И вот здесь я увидела схожесть повествований Полы Хокинс и Гиллиан Флинн. Оба автора вводили меня в заблуждение. Хокинс заставила меня сначала поверить, что Меган и Скотт счастливая идеальная пара; Тому и Анне хорошо живется с их маленькой дочуркой; а грустно и одиноко только Рейчел, спившейся брошенке. На деле, хочется сказать, что у Рейчел было все нормально, пока она не полезла туда, куда лезть не следовало, да и еще и сама получила по шапке. Мне понравилось, как нам на протяжении книги раскрывали персонажей дальше. Я видела, какие они все же другие, не такие, какими нам их показали вначале. Я сначала прикинула, кто мог оказаться убийцей, но после мое мнение менялось раз за разом и только где-то за сотню страниц до конца книги я точно поняла (практически вместе с главной героиней), кто же настоящий убийца. Достаточно закручено, ввязаны во все это практически все действующие лица. Это интригует. Не скажу, что я удивилась развязке, даже этого следовало ожидать. И вот сделала парочку выводов: а) некоторые бабы просто жиру бесятся; б) изменил один раз, изменит еще.Но идея с поездом мне очень понравилась. Необычно. Интересно. И показывает нам, как порой случайно можно оказаться в центре странных событий.Хороший триллер. Но для меня чуть-чуть не дотянул. 4.4 => 4.P.S. Возможно, кому-то покажется, что отзыв получился немного несвязный. Все из-за того, что я боялась сболтнуть лишнего и испортить всю интригу триллера. Безумно не хотелось спойлерить.
Сегодня я уверена, что впереди меня ждет долгая ночь. А утром мне надо встать рано, чтобы успеть на поезд.
"
868,Beth,"I really liked this book. There were enough twists and turns for me to try to go through a few different theories of ""who did it.""One thing that bothered me, though, is that the internal narrator of all the women was identical. I refuse to believe that we all have the same type of internal monologue day in and day out. It doesn't make sense."
869,Linda Winter,"Von Anfang an hat mich das Buch gefesselt und ich musste mich teilweise zwingen, es aus der Hand zu legen. Ich fand es nur Schade, dass ab der Hälfte das Ende recht leicht vorausschaubar war und somit war es weniger die Spannung als eher der Gedanke ""Ich muss jetzt wissen, ob am Ende noch etwas Unerwartetes passiert"", der mich bei der Stange gehalten hat. Daher war ich leider auch vom Ende enttäuscht, denn bis zur letzten Seite dachte ich noch, dass was passieren würde, was ich nicht erwartet hatte. Kam aber nicht. Trotzdem: super-spannend geschrieben und ich mochte den schnellen Perspektiven-Wechsel und die Ausarbeitung der Charaktere. "
870,Saturday's Child,Kept me turing the pages and wanting to know what happens next.
871,Lindsay Underwood,"Great book. Super intense. Felt very Gone Girl-ey, but I read it in about a day. "
872,Karly Stilling,"Rachel, an unemployed alcoholic, travels the same route on the train everyday, passing by her old house which her ex-husband Tom now shares with his new wife Anna and their daughter Evie. A few houses down, Rachel watches a beautiful couple she imagines to have the perfect life until one day, she sees the perfect wife kissing another man. When she finds out the wife has gone missing, she can’t help but become involved in the investigation.The Girl on the Train is a quick read—suspenseful and engaging, it kept me up late several nights just wanting to find out what happened next. The novel is well-paced, and very effective in its twists and reveals, with writing which prioritizes voice and plot over prose, which is typical of this type of thriller. And while I did find the prose lacking in a certain elegance, it was engaging and easy to follow.Told in first person, the story jumps timeframes and narrators, and within the chapters, is broken up by date and by time of day—morning for the morning commute, and evening for the evening commute. While this structure works well to start, highlighting the limited nature of the narrator’s perspective, the gimmick becomes a bit clunky to adhere to as the narrative moves beyond what Rachel observes from the train. Ultimately, Hawkins’ writing displays a deep tenderness towards her flawed protagonist, forcing Rachel further into her own faults in order to finally find redemption, and the novel finds a satisfying ending for both the mystery of the wife’s disappearance, and Rachel’s own involvement in the case."
873,Emily Graham,"This book was recommended reading in Overdrive when I was searching for Elizabeth Berg. I like that it changes narrators each chapter. That's a format I really enjoy. It was more of a mystery novel than I expected. There were a lot of twists and turns in the plot. Even though it wasn't what I expected, I had a hard time putting it down. "
874,Sandra Foy,"I was wary of this book, or rather I was wary of the hype surrounding it. After the disastrous Apple Tree Yard (separate review on my blog) which I looked forward to but found hugely disappointing, I bore no expectations for The Girl On The Train, infact, if I’m honest, was probably ready to dislike it.The book has at its heart three female characters:The main protagonist is Rachel, whose life is at an all time low. Her marriage has broken down, she has lost her job, she is very lonely and to compensate she drinks; heavily.I really empathised with Rachel, I am sure a lot of people will see her as weak and foolish but to me she just came across as human; flawed but with a good heart.Next there is Megan, who also has had a troubled life but has now found happiness with husband Scott…or so Rachel thinks.Then there is Anna, who is the Goldilocks in Rachel’s life. She lives in her house, sleeps in her bed and no doubt eats porridge in her kitchen. All with her ex-husband and the baby daughter they have had together.Rachel travels into London everyday on the train. The train stops regularly at a set of signals and she gets used to seeing a couple on their terrace. She makes up blissful lives for them, giving them names, Jason and Jess, and careers. She looks on enviously until one day she sees something that casts everything into doubt. Rachel feels that she needs to help out, it gives her life some purpose, but also leads to trouble.It is difficult to say anymore without giving the plot away.So does the book live up to the hype? For me, a big fat yes. Paula Hawkins has written a compelling, suspenseful book in which I thought the characters were very human. It makes you look at relationships and realise sometimes nothing is what it seems and people really do weave tangled webs for themselves. I thoroughly enjoyed it and will look forward to future books from this author.****"
875,Ginger Leroy,A page turner!!!! Wow! Highly recommend. 
876,Sense_less Sense_less,"La început am fost toată numai zâmbete când am pus mâna pe un PDF al acestei cărţi. O voiam cu disperare în format printat, timpul însă a fost împotriva mea şi n-am apucat să dau pe la o librărie, iar toate site-urile de cărţi n-o mai aveau în stoc. Acum că mă gândesc mai bine nu cred că aş mai procura-o. Cartea a fost ~bună~ recunosc, am citit-o în două zile. Mi se părea intrigant titlul, ideea unei necunoscute care studiază persoane din tren, fata misterioasă care nu iese niciodată la lumină. Cred că totuşi am avut prea multe aşteptări. Recunosc, am adorat felul în care a fost scrisă. Un stil simplu, clar, concis. Dar prea din scurt pentru mine. Pe la jumătatea cărţii mi-am dat deja seama cine a fost de fapt autorul teribilei dispariţii a lui ""Jess"", iar de la o carte care se încadrează în aria ""mister-thriller"" nu m-a prea ţinut în priză. Speram ca la final să rămân cu un mind-blow de zile mari, care să mă facă să mă gândesc la sensul vieţii şi la... nu ştiu, orice? Însă nu mi-au rămas prea multe. Speram tot timpul ca personajul principal să facă ceva mai MARE, să întoarcă situaţia pe toate părţile şi să descopere ceva magnific. Însă ea doar s-a afundat în alcool şi depresia caracteristică care a cam lăsat de dorit. Sincer am găsit mai mult mister în cărţi de dragoste absolut banale, motiv pentru care de la mine primeşte 4 cu indulgenţă. "
877,Janine,"I agree with others that, in the post Gone-Girl era, this book has the most similar tone to Gone Girl that I have come across. That being said, I didn't necessarily feel that it was trying to be the next Gone Girl either. The characters, while not likable for the most part, were also not always downright despicable either. Rachel, whose narration we see the most, is damaged. She's not a bad person, but she is an emotionally damaged alcoholic, which leads her to make poor choices. Even Megan does the things that she does because she is scarred from her past, and trying to run away from things that have hurt her. I think it helps to be able to feel some sympathy for at least some of the characters in a book, and I did here.The book offered intrigue as the reader tries to piece together the mystery, and wonder about the black hole in Rachel's memory and what it means. It kept me interested, and I did read most of the book in one sitting--something I haven't done in a long time. "
878,Lauren," A Bumpy Ride​“My head leaning against the carriage window, I watch these houses roll past me like a tracking shot in a film. I see them as others do not; even their owners probably don’t see them from this perspective. Twice a day, I am offered a view into other lives, just for a moment.” The Girl on the Train is a novel, written by Paula Hawkins in the form of diary entries from three women’s points of view. It is an interesting read that is directed for older readers. In my opinion, the main issues and emotions that that place in this novel are hard to relate to as a young reader because teens or even some people in their twenties are not exposed to these problems. Issues such as divorce, addiction, withdrawal, and denial are, for the most part, harder concepts for most teens and young readers to understand and relate to. The book was enticing in its plot, but due to age and experience issues with young readers, probably a better fit for older readers who can relate more to the book’s content.​In The Girl on the Train, Rachel, a now divorced and unemployed alcoholic rides the train past her old home near the tracks every day. She sees the old home she loved before the divorce and envies her ex-husband’s new wife and their successful family that she longed for before the divorce. She sometimes calls up her ex-husband, Tom, or stops by the house, which scars Tom’s new wife, Anna. Rachel also sees a young couple a few doors down, whom she has never met but imagines as the perfects couple. She thinks up each of their backstories and some scenarios in her mind that she thinks happens in their everyday lives. When there is a murder in the neighborhood, Rachel becomes interested and involved. She wants to find out everything she can about the night of the murder, but has to put the pieces of information she gathers together about that night like a puzzle because that night she was drunk and woke up at home with bruises and scars and no recollection of the night before. She will not stop until she finds out exactly what happened, and once she does, she learns more about her own past than she could ever have imagined.​Some criticisms about the book would be how the diary entries can sometimes become confusing, because they jump back and forth between times. For example, the person who was murdered was already dead; however, all of a sudden an entry would come up written by her a month earlier. Another argument is that it isn’t as relatable to young readers. The date issue can be resolved by using context clues and by paying close attention to diary entry dates so this isn’t that bad of an issue; however, the age issue isn’t as easy to fix. If a reader is mature the book can be entertaining and give people insight on some behavioral trends in different types of people, but if anything a reader can wait a few years to read it at a time when they can connect with the struggles it contains better. One of the positive things is that the time is set in the year 2013, so recent items and concepts make the book more relatable for readers too. ​Overall the book was interesting and had some unthinkable plot twists. It wasn’t super predictable and it brought up real life issues that people around the world face. It could be really relatable to most audiences and enticing to all. The issues of alcoholism, murder, withdrawal, and denial make the book feel more real and relatable as well. This book showed both the dark and the light sides of things and proved that not everything is exactly as it seems."
879,Janina,"I found this book very thrilling to read. I absolutely love the way the story is told from the (highly) subjective viewpoints of three women and we don't really know how reliable any of them are. It seemed very well thought out psychologically and I found myself liking and disliking all three of them at the same time. I did not like the last 2-3 chapters all that much and found the ending very predictable and cliched .. though that is both disappointing as well as good since (at least to me) it made sense. I don't like many thrillers (or crime) stories because they are either way too predictable or the ending is just completely unreasonable (and thus unpredictable). This one is more about the development of the three main female characters and that made the story very enjoyable even though the ending could have been resolved better. Be advised though that it does contain some scenes that I found very hard to stomach .. not for their gruesomeness, but just for what happened (and because it does happen and it's not some insane silly thriller plot). Also, I've heard of this book being compared to Gone Girl a lot and I can't see any reason for this comparison. The books have nothing in common and this one is far superior to Gone Girl in my opinion."
880,Siddharth Chakravarthy,"Phew ! After 7 hours, I finally finished this book.Coming to the Story, Though it was a bit draggy and lengthy, The narration was above par and it made the Murky story interesting to read. By Murky i meant, this story was kind of similar to ""Gone Girl"" and It was full of 'Affairs' ,'Affairs', 'Affairs'!! I don't usually read books of this genre but this one din't really let me down. It was new to me and As i said, It had shades of 'Gone Girl'and overall, It was an interesting read but a Lengthy one ! "
881,Rachel Koshie,I liked this one. Maybe I'm not very sharp but I definitely did not see this one coming. I certainly wish Ms. Hawkins had developed some of the characters a little more. I personally loved how I didn't side with the protagonist all the time. I just wanted to shake her up sometimes. Definitely worth reading. I couldn't stop. I almost left work early one day to get back to the book.
882,Tylzia Moore,"Well, it was a good read, but I pretty much figured out the story by page 42. Still, I read it because I had to know what happened and how."
883,Susanna,"An interesting mystery in the vein of Gone Girl and Memento. Maybe I'd have preferred a few less clues so that the culprit would have remained a mystery for longer, but all in all the story was good. I don't think I liked a single one of the characters, but they definitely conformed to my cynical view of human nature. The insight into an alcoholics mindset was very believable. All in all, this was a well written and interesting mystery, if not exactly mindblowing. Definitely worth the read."
884,Ann Godridge,"It took me a little while to get into this novel, as initially I was irritated by the structure. The story is told in the first person by three female narrators (not equally balanced, but all distinct voices). In addition to that it's not linear - so I found myself constantly referring back a few pages to see who was speaking and when.However, once I was about a third of the way in, it became easier to follow and I was riveted by the story and constantly questioning who could be trusted - not only doubting the reliability of all three narrators, but also questioning their judgements of the men in the case. A fascinating, morally complex story and well worth the initial difficulty. "
885,Fanficfan44,"Just finished this last night and really did find it to be a page turner. No really likeable characters, except maybe Scott and Cathy, although her enabling of Rachel was really at epic proportions. The book is about Rachel, who rides the trains, not to get anywhere in particular but more to maintain a sense of normality and to avoid questions from Cathy. As you find out within just a few pages of beginning the book, Rachel is an alcoholic and not just an alcoholic but a blackout drinker. She is obsessed with her ex-husband and with a young couple (Megan and Scott) that are his close neighbors. Rachel is engaged in a horrific downward spiral, that gets only more complicated when Megan is murdered and Rachel wakes up with injuries and blood on her and no memory of what occured. The story takes you on this frustrating spiraling search with Rachel as she tries to remember, sorting through false memories and lies.I had guessed the ending somewhat before (it seemed obvious to me) but I don’t want to give any spoilers. Just to say this is really one of those stories that shows that you never really know someone else. As an aside, there is an old movie that this reminded me of somewhat The Morning After, fans of the book might like the movie."
886,Leanora,"If you liked Gone Girl, read this book. It's intense, full of twists and turns, haunting and well done. Prepare to have a hard time putting this book down; I've stayed up past my bedtime for two nights in a row to finish it. "
887,Daniela Boksjo,"Couldn't stop reading it!After the next book for a long trip, then the girl on the train is a great option. Read it non stop during a 7 h flight between Sydney to Tokyo. Really entertaining! The end was a bit Hollywoodish, but who caress, the whole story is awesome! Great thriller"
888,Nela,4.5 
889,Joshua Radwell,"People are comparing this book to Gone Girl, but I would have to disagree, Gone Girl is far more psychologically dark and terrifying, this book is more of a light thriller with a bit of psychological mis-happenings. But that's not to say this book is bad, the book is fantastic! The characters are flawed but it is written in such a way that it makes the book very enjoyable and the characters very likeable. I loved the depth of Rachel's character, it really went into why she drinks, why she is almost insane in my opinion, why sue obsesses, and it's clever. Megan to was also very intriguing, she is a terrific liar! But she too is flawed, and although she is flawed, she is such a perfect character. Much like Rachel, the two are a perfect blend of crazy and sane, there is a little bit of a nut in both their personalities. The story started a little slow, but it really picked up and I found myself reading a lot each day, trying to put it down to savour it for the next day, but it's only lasted me a week. The ending was a twist I didn't see, and that's what I like...a book that keeps you questioning and the answer is not what you expect!!If you like Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl or A.S.A Harrison's The Silent Wife, than The Girl On The Train will be a fun read for you, although not as intense, it is definitely a very psychologically interesting book!Overall, 4.5 stars, it just lacked a little in the beginning and somewhat in the middle, but it makes up for it. A terrific thriller!!!! Can't wait to see what Paula Hawkins delivers next."
890,Emily Jane,"Idk what to feel about the ending, actually. I was really enjoying the story and maybe expected too much but... I still liked it. I can't help but feel so bad for Rachel though at first I don't even find her a likeable character at all. But then omg I just want to hug her and Cathy too cause she's such a good friend and can we just appreciate Cathy more please "
891,Tiffany Thatcher,Great suspense/mystery. The events of a disappearance as remembered by someone in a drinker blackout. I had to keep reading to find out what really happened. 
892,Lorra Metko,"Murder mysteries aren't my favorite genre, but I couldn't stop reading this book! It was difficult to predict, and I appreciate that in a book. I couldn't get the last line of the old folk song "" Frankie and Johnny"" out of my head: ""This story only goes to show you, that there just ain't no good in men. They'll do you wrong, just as sure as you're born."""
893,Sayako,"I liked this thriller. It has tight writing suspense and good character development. Nothing is what it seems to be. The people who look perfect have huge problems . The ones who have flaws in the beginning , have their reasons to be what they are. And they will find their way. The main character Rachel is broken. She is not broken for the reasons we think she is. That her ex left her for someone else. There are more thing. She is divorced and she hates the fact that her ex left her when she had problems because could not have a baby. And in addttion he found an other woman and now he has a baby. She is a wreck and it is understandable. She could not realize that she will not really have a baby and her husband never supported her. And in addition he found another woman and he did what she always wanted in the same house she chose to live and tells her how happy the new wife is. I think that it is not that strange that she is still blaming him for not being supportive enough, for treason, etc. And i think that she is right in many ways. Tom was selfish , he did care just for his joy and he still is this kind of person.I suspected in the first forty pages what happens between the three ladies and their relationship. This is the reason that i gave four stars and not five. I did not like Anna but i liked how realistic she was portrayed. There are many Annas everywhere. Mengan on the other side had her own demons to fight. Her fault is that in her desperation she did could not make the right choices. The mystery was good even if i had suspected it as possible. It is a good book if you enjoy thrillers and mystery. It has similar points with the gone girl book.. obviously but many things are different , it is not the same book (thank god) even if i liked both."
894,Nigeyb,"A well written, UK-centric, crime novel based around commuting in and out of London. Unlikely as it sounds, from this mundane premise emerges an original, highly readable and absorbing tale. The tale is told from the viewpoints of some of the characters and each narration frequently gives a very different perspective on the same events. There are hints of the denouement quite early on thereby reducing some of the suspense and yet The Girl on the Train remains intriguing and engrossing from start to finish.4/5"
895,Kelly McCoy,"I’m going to keep this short and sweet, because just about everyone is talking about this book, and well, what can I say that hasn’t already been said? I picked it up knowing very little about it, just that it was named “the book to read in January” and of course the endless comparisons to Gone Girl. It seems anytime a psychological thriller is written by a woman it’s suddenly the next Gone Girl, and in my opinion that hurts a book more than helps it. Gone Girl is really one of a kind, and comparing everything to it sets a really high almost impossible to reach standard. Girl on the Train is a wonderful mystery. It pulled me in and I was determined to know what really happened that night. All of the characters were interesting, but also unlikeable and that always keeps my attention. Although I wouldn’t compare this to anything by Gillian Flynn I really enjoyed reading Girl on the Train and would recommend it to mystery lovers. "
896,Carol,"It is one of those books that you finish in one day! A modern Hitchcock style mystery with an unreliable narrator that is an alcoholic.There are comparisons to Gone Girl, but I found this mystery darker."
897,Marta Santos,"Sabem quando pensam ""este devia ser o assassino"", mas nada da história leva a crer isso? Foi o que se passou com este livro. A escrita é intensa e está bem conseguida. Só fiquei desiludida com o final, estava à espera de algo ainda mais dramático.. Por isso as 4 estrelas, que estão quase a cair para as 5.."
898,Silver,"a great psychological thriller ! once i started reading it i couldn't stop ! the main character is Rachel *the girl on the train*, a depressed drunkard, she spends her days pretending that she's going to work, everyday she takes the train that goes past a stretch of cozy suburban houses, and on her little journeys she daily watch and imagines the life of the same couple who live in one of the houses. she named them *Jess and Jason*. They are the perfect couple, or at least they are inside her head. but one day , Rachel sees Jess Kissing some guy, a guy who wasn't Jason her Husband, and she’s devastated.Jess goes missing soon after that, and Rachel manages to get herself into a huge mess, a lot of secrets, dirty secrets. i really enjoyed this book, it was just amazing. "
899,PeterB,"A decent debut thriller. Written from various character perspectives a la Martin Amis' London Fields or Julian Barnes' Talking it Over, several of the key scenes overlap to provide different insight into the same events. I won't rehash the premise of the story (read the blurb). At times it can be a slightly uncomfortable read, more through the open and honest way the characters and their thoughts are portrayed, although this does lend itself to a lack of sympathy with any of the main characters. It may stretch credulity at points but it did the job of keeping me reading. As I said, a decent, well written thriller, with an engaging plot that you won't necessarily guess the ending to. I will read the author's next novel which, I think, is praise enough."
900,Lorena,"'La chica del tren' ha sido el gran descubrimiento del año. Lo vi anunciado en tanto sitios que decidí darle una oportunidad. Esperaba un libro de terror, de esos que no te dejan dormir, pero para nada (al menos a mí miedo no me dio) Sin embargo, es un libro que se lee rápido ya que está muy bien narrado y te ofrece distintos puntos de vista (Aunque la principal es Rachel, la protagonista). El 'New York Times (creo, xd) lo calificó como un narrador engañoso, y no puedo estar más de acuerdo. Desde luego, algo tiene el libro que no te permite dejar de leer en ningún momento. Rachel es uno de esos personajes que, aparentemente no es muy interesante y de hecho, en muchas partes del libro, parece que vive a través de los demás, pero la desaparición de 'Jess' (Que no es un spoiler porque desaparece al principio del libro y el resto está dedicado a la investigación que lleva a cabo Rachel) y su deseo por descubrir la verdad la llevarán a descubrir numerosos aspectos de su vida (Además de investigar toda la vida de Megan e interferir incluso en la labor policial) que tal vez no eran como ella pensaba. Mucha gente lo ha comparado con 'Perdida' de Gillian Flynn, aunque no lo he leído. Lo tengo pendiente ;)"
901,Lynossa,"The marketing message that is being used for this book is 'unreliable narration like Gone Girl' and that had my interest. Not because there's a mention of Gone Girl (there's always a reference to the best selling books in the genre when it comes to introducing new book; almost all fantasy novels use 'Harry Potter' in its marketing), but because of the 'unreliable narration' part.When it comes to unreliable narration, there's one book that I remember the most and it's not Gone Girl. It's The Murder of Roger Ackroyd by Agatha Christie. Long before Gillian Flynn made her story, Dame Christie and all her brilliancy created such a twist that became phenomenal.Anyway, back to The Girl on the Train. It is an awesome thriller book which I finished in a day and I have been in my reading slump before this so this book really helps me get back to my reading straits.I'd like to mention that unlike Roger Ackroyd and Gone Girl, the 'unreliable narration' in this book is different. It wasn't purposely made that way by the character. She is unreliable due to other characters or things in her life. So even though the marketing strategy worked in getting me hooked, I can't help but feeling cheated when I'm done reading this book.Marketing aside, this book is good. It has all the materials necessary for suspense novel; the twist, the conflict, the dark past. It might be too much at one point but I think we can forgive since the book is really good.Is it predictable? Yes, for me it's a bit too predictable. But is it an interesting ride until the last page? You bet."
902,Sue Jackson,"I knew absolutely nothing about this book other than it was on a best seller list. One day, I walked into the library & was told ""it's your lucky day"" and handed this book. Apparently it is part of a first-come, first-served program. It doesn't go into the queue and I just happened to be at the right place at the right time. It is not something I would normally pick up but I figured...why not read it after all it was ""my lucky day"".The main character is Rachel who also narrates her journey on a commuter train and what follows. She watches others as she rides and envisions what she thinks their lies must be like. She is especially involved with the area that used to be her home and is now the home of her ex-husband and his current family. In the last couple of years, Rachel has become depressed, put on weight, and started drinking heavily. Those three seem to have a large impact on her lack of confidence and her behavior.The other two narrators are Anna, her ex-husband's wife, and Megan, a vision from the train and later a murder victim. There are only a few other characters in this book but none of them have a chapter in which they narrate. One day, Rachel sees something showing from the train and decides that she needs to get involved. Soon, she becomes aware of Megan's murder and, for some reason, need to be involved by befriending Megan's husband. There are many twists and turns and the reader is kept in suspense with exactly who could have committed this murder. Paula Hawkins does keep the reader in suspense until near the end.Although I loved the surprise of the ending but it didn't seem as strong as the rest of the book. It also took me a bit to get used to the fact that the days of Anna's and Rachel's entries were approximately the same, but Megan's chapters were a couple of month's earlier. I was also not thrilled with the fact that all three women were all out of work and needy. The story would have been just as good, if not better, with stronger female characters."
903,Wendy Kendall,"As the girl rides the daily commuter train to London, she stares out her window at rows of houses lining the tracks. She grabs little glimpses into other people’s lives. The girl is Rachel. Sometimes she takes what she sees at face value, and sometimes she makes up her own fantasies and stories about what she sees. But then, on a day that seems so much like every other day, she suddenly glimpses something shocking out the window. Now everything has changed. Whether it’s Rachel’s curiosity or her heroics, something compels her to get off that train and climb aboard a very dangerous ride. Rachel is carrying her own grim baggage, wrestling with her own personal problems as the book proceeds with her involvement in a dark, mystery along the train tracks.The author has written this book with Rachel as the primary narrator, but interspersed are chapters written with different narrating characters. As events transpire you’ll read from these different perspectives, and you’re subject to the different character’s motivations, personalities, manipulations and weaknesses. Some of these characters drove me wild with frustration, others touched my heart, and others intrigued me. With this powerfully descriptive writing, they each elicited a strong response in me. It’s up to the reader to decide who is really what they seem, and who is not, and whether you’re seeing the events described accurately? As a reader, who can you trust?Paula Hawkins has written a slow-building suspense mystery. It’s like a train that starts with a jolt, slowly builds up speed, and then in the end is propelled forward to its ultimate destination. In this case, the rider/reader will find the novel’s final ending an unannounced surprise. The author said in an interview, “I know people like to read about serial killers and spies, but most of us will never encounter these things. Sadly, most of the threats we encounter are at home.” This mystery features themes of domestic violence and alcohol and drug abuse. It asks the slippery question of whether people can ever truly know their spouses or themselves. The author describes what makes a psychological mystery more complex than the average thriller, “the atmosphere of menace that infects the everyday.”Thereby hangs a tale . . . ."
904,Adriana Davesa melero,"4'5 en realidad. La comparan con Perdida. No todo un acierto desde mi punto de vista. Perdida para mi no tiene comparación. me habían hypeado demasiado esta novela y mis ganas de leerla solo aumentaban. Cuando la compré y la empecé, el ritmo me parecía muy lento, demasiado. Sabía que tenía que dejar un margen para que me enganchara a la historia, que seguro que lo hacía. Y así fue. Tras un atracón de lectura, conseguí sumergirme de lleno en la trama y los plot twists empezaron a llegar. Es una historia muy confusa, contada desde la perspectiva de diferentes personajes y mezclando espacios temporales del presente y el pasado. El estilo de la autora es perfecto. Sabe introducirte pistas a lo largo de la novela sin que te des cuenta, al igual que hacerte sospechar de todos y de nadie. Me encanta eso de tener que pensar quién es el malo y quién no lo es. Había muchas cosas que, obviamente, no me esperaba y me ha parecido todo muy acertado. El final es lo que me ha chirriado un poco, pero en este tipo de novelas, suele ser así. La chica del tren me ha dejado con buen sabor de boca y a pesar de su longitud, es una novela que se lee en un santiamén."
905,Shanae,"I found THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN to be terribly slow at times...I'm certain it could have been 100 pages shorter. The first third of the novel was boring, but about halfway through, it really picked up and I was able to finish it in just a few days. Paula Hawkins really kept me engaged and told a great story with some interesting twists and turns. I definitely enjoyed it. "
906,faeriemyst,"Wow, I really didn't expect to like this book that much. I had recently read Gone Girl, which this isn't that similar other than it features twisted, damaged people, but was looking for something that felt close to the same. I was almost sorry that I decided to pick this up as I literally could not put it down and ended up staying up past my bedtime yesterday.Rachel, the narrator, is an alcoholic mess who had just reached my OMG-just-quit-whinging-already! threshold when the author wisely moved the story forward. She still had her pathetic moments but I empathized with her and hoped she'd stop drinking and get help. The book was paced well and had just enough of the other two points of view from Megan and Anna as not to feel like an intrusion. I wasn't surprised by the whodunnit aspect since I had long suspected that character, but kudos to the author for keeping me on my toes with the other possibilties. I really enjoyed reading about the characters, situations and would be interested in Paula Hawkins' next book."
907,Sifra (brilliant bookshelf),*Review coming
908,Janna,"I really, really enjoyed this book (so whoever in book club picked it - good job!). It was a little slow to start, and alternating narrators is not something I usually enjoy - but this book made it worth keeping up with. Once it picked up, I was quickly hooked and had to know ""who done it"" immediately. I am usually frustratingly good at predicting books, and was so pleasantly surprised that I didn't know in the one - each chapter had my questioning everything I had thought so far. I started and finished this book in two evenings - so it's a quick read if you have a few hours. I would definitely recommend, and can't wait to talk it out at book club tomorrow!Why not 5 stars? Because this book will not change your life. A month from now, you probably won't still be wondering about the characters or even remembering anything significant about it. I reserve 5 stars for books that are a bit more memorable - the kind that sooth you, haunt you or in some way teach you. Those which you immediately have to tell everyone you know to read, and dread even the thought of it becoming a movie because you have such a vivid version playing in your head and no director will ever get it quite right. But for me to give it 4 stars is still pretty high on my scale!"
909,Charline,"3.5 - 4 star rating.I know there has been a lot of hype about this book, so I was excited to finally read it. However, I don't think it quite matches the hype. It's good, but I was expecting more. Maybe I was expecting too much from the rave reviews.I guessed what was going to happen about halfway through, so the big reveal didn't come as a shock. A lot of people seem to compare this book with Gillian Flynn's work. In my opinion it isn't written as well as her books. But saying all that, it is still a good book especially the last 100 pages or so and it only took me 3 or 4 sitting to read."
910,Gearóid,Really good!!!!!A real enjoyable suspenseful page turner!Once I got into the story just couldn't put it down.Great one to read if you commute by train!
911,Carol -  Reading Writing and Riesling,"My View:A brilliant expose of addiction, isolation and alcoholism woven neatly into a narrative of manipulation and mystery. The book begins slowly, (personally I would have liked to have seen the tempo increased and a little more tension built into the earlier part of the book), yet despite the slow pace I did enjoy this read and there is a lovely twist or two in this one that you will not see coming. The last few chapters are bursting with action, mystery, violence and suspense. This is a great debut novel and this author is certainly one to look out for.After you have read this book you will never look at a bottle of wine or a gin and tonic the same way again…Have you read this book? What did you think? I think sometimes the hype surrounding a book can be detrimental to your enjoyment of the read – expectations can cause the bar to be unrealistically high. Perhaps you are better of not having heard anything about this book before you pick it up and let the writing speak for itself. "

913,Tara Lambros,Great ReadThis book held me captive the entire time. I finished it in three days. I will definitely recommend this book!
914,Carmel McCartin,"It started slowly, but the pace quickened as the plot developed. Soon, I couldn't put it down. "
915,Mandy Blomenkamp,This book was a potato chip murder mystery. Loved it!
916,Kaitlyn,"(4.5 stars)I really enjoyed this book. It was a great character study and they were super intriguing. I though that some parts of this book could have been better, but it was overall very enjoyable. I loved the ending, for some reason it made me feel really empowered. "
917,Lesley,Strong finish!Not the most likeable characters but that was ok the story of the voyeurism and lies was well worth it. Strong finish. 
918,Puneri,"Bam! This one hit me right in the heart, and for all the right reasons. Paula Hawkins' debut is absolutely a ride worth taking. It's intense, suspenseful and also very touching. People's fate and behavior and very entangled relationships moved me. Paula wrote with such swiftness that I was glued to the pages. Towards the end, I was kinda got where it's going but it still kept me guessing, what if? will it? I will definitely recommend this to all the fans of mystery, fiction and fast paced reading. Looking forward to read more of her work."
919,Josh Ang,"This is probably one of the more captivating thrillers I have read in recent memory. For a debut novelist (career as a journalist notwithstanding), Paula Hawkins has really produced quite an exceptional whodunnit, and with an ingenious structure and narrative style, that worked really well.Three women, Rachel, Anna and Megan, share the narrative, and the chapters indicate the time and day of events, as each character sees and experiences them. Rachel travels daily to London on a train to her office and passes by a row of houses each day. She has become particularly enamoured with a couple in one of these houses, whom she names Jason and Jess. But there is more than just random voyeurism that draws her attention to that particular neighbourhood, and Hawkins takes her time revealing important details, as Rachel's story becomes intertwined with Anna's and Megan's, and how these women are connected becomes integral to the central plot, when a crime occurs.Hawkins keeps the reader hooked to the many twists and turns in the story, and it is to her credit that she takes time to build up her characters, especially Rachel, the titular girl on the train, who is as pitiable as she is a deplorable parasitic mess. Despite these contrary feelings she incites in the reader, she endears as well and repels, and we are never quite sure if we can fully trust her. The sense of unease permeates the story and the reader cannot rest easy until he or she reaches the last page. A very intriguing read."
920,Aaricia,"“I have lost control over everything, even the places in my head.”"
921,Denise Wright-ianni,Couldn't put it down!
922,Leslea,"I really enjoyed this book - a lone girl on a train passing by the same house every day watching the lives of the 2 inhabitants, she even gives them names, Jessica and Jason. Things change one day when she sees Jessica kissing a man who is not Jason. Then in the news Jessica's body is found - she has been murdered. She decides to get involved by telling the Police about this other man she saw and then she just wont leave things alone causing more trouble. Her ex husband and his new wife live a few doors up from Jason and our girl hasn't gotten over him. The reader really cant sympathise with our main character as she spends most of her time drunk, making a nuisance of herself with the ex, the Police and Jason as the mystery slowly unfolds. There are a few people who could have murdered Jessica but it really keeps you guessing right to the end."
923,Jeremy,"I'll join most reviewers and compare this to Gone Girl. It was better. This book was as much about addiction, loss, insecurity, mental illness, and gender roles as it was about an unsolved crime. Both books' characters were almost exclusively terrible human beings. Gone Girl's were wholly self-centered and vindictive. The Girl on the Train's were terrible people for reasons that actual people are; they try to find happiness within the constraints of complex and impossible interpersonal relationships and have to come to terms with their inadequacies and cope with rejection. The antecedents of substance abuse and depression are real and relatable and impact the reader. Gone Girl had an intriguing plot but was just full of assholes."
924,Anna (AnnaReads.com),"Finally a book that lives up to the ""good for fans of Gone Girl"" accolade. Every single character is such a disaster, which made guessing the conclusion both impossible and fun. Didn't see the ending coming till mostly through with the book, which I loved. It's always fun to be surprised!"
925,Rebecca Warren,Another page turner I could not put down. I liked this better than Gone Girl because some more likable characters with all their human foibles.
926,Camilla Muir,"Great, fast page turner read. However it lost some of its umph at the end....but it had me going!"
927,Margaret,"A fine sample of mystery/ thriller/ crime story! Highly recommended , a real page turner. The ""who did it "" part is not so important, what really matters is that the reader is experiencing the same agony that the heroine is going through. I am expecting many great stories from Paula Hawkins."

929,Jayme(the ghost reader),"A woman rides the rain every day back in forth to work. She passed by a house where she gets a glance at a couple's life. She paints a nice little picture and creates a life she thinks they lead. One day, her perfect couple are not so perfect. Megan, the woman has disappeared. Rachel, the woman who rides the train thinks she suspects who did it. She tries to go to the police but they don't believe her. The story gets complicated. The missing woman used to babysit for Rachel's ex husband and his new wife. Anna, the new wife becomes paranoid of Rachel. I have read some of the reviews and they compare this book to ""Gone Girl"". I will say it is similar but I enjoyed this book over ""Gone Girl."" I preferred the main character in this book to that of ""Gone Girl"" and the book flowed better. "
930,Mona," ""It's impossible to resist the kindness of strangers. Someone who looks at you, who doesn’t know you, who tells you it’s OK, whatever you did, whatever you’ve done: you suffered, you hurt, you deserve forgiveness."" I liked it but not as much as I loved Gone Girl. I liked the story, the writing style and the characters were so good written. It is good but I didn't enjoy reading it. so depressing."
931,Kasey,"I don't give 5 star reviews very often, so I'd give this one a 4.5. It did surprise me, in a number of satisfying ways! First of all, ""The Girl on the Train"" definitely merits all the critical praise and accolades it has received. Slowly at first, then with the pull of an undertow, then compelling, the story -- the mystery -- pushes the reader forward, picking up speed, like the trains which populate its pages. At first, I liked Rachel, though I felt sorry for her; I found myself feeling the same for Megan. As more back story is revealed, more confessions made, I felt many different things for these characters, but always the sense that no one here is telling the full truth, to others or to themselves. I found myself more and more compelled to find out who was lying, who was holding back, and why. I didn't see the Hitchcock-Ian turn coming until near the end. Thoroughly enjoyable, and quite creepy -- not monsters in the sewers creepy, but the creepiness of realizing, again, what monsters can lie behind the life of a normal human face and mundane human lives."
932,Pamela Van Arsdale,"Not great literature by any measure, but a fabulous, quick, summer thriller! Told from the perspective of 3 different women, the story keeps building suspense throughout. It's not as big of a shocker as Gone Girl, it's much easier to figure out the mystery. But, it's more tightly written, a stronger psychological thriller without giving in to cheaper conventions. I love that the author gave small snippets of the sex scenes, of the lingering before and after, and didn't turn this into a "" fifty shades"" thriller... It just doesn't need that and smart readers don't either. This story can carry itself. No doubt that this will be made into a movie.... If they cast it ( and write the screenplay) well it could be as good as Douglass and Close in "" Fatal Attraction."""
933,Jessie Dawson,I was so annoyed with Rachel's character that I did not see the end coming. Excellent read! 
934,Arsh Hayer,"Rachel takes the train everyday to go to ""work"". The train always passes by the house that contained Rachel's old life. She was living with her husband Tom, until he decided to have an affair with another woman. Rachel believes that she's the reason why Tom left her. She couldn't get pregnant. Since she couldn't conceive she became very upset and depressed. She started to drink on a regular basis. Rachel has been taking the train at the same time every single day. She passes by a house where a couple lives. She adores the couple. She looks forward to seeing them everyday. She named them Jess and Jason. She creates their life story in her head. One day as she's passing by on the train she sees something terrible. Rachel has no idea who to tell or what to do.I feel like the book was pretty slow passed until about the last 75 pages or so. That's when the story got very juicy. This book made me hate certain characters A Lot!! I love Rachel because of all her imperfections. She's just a woman who's having trouble getting her life in order and all of a sudden she is faced with a problem that she can't ignore. You have to be patient with this book because the ending is absolutely worth it."

936,Pia,"My curiosity was piqued by this novel upon seeing it at the bestseller list for quite a while, at the same time I was quite skeptic as to how this could be such a bestseller.With the first few pages I was drawn to Rachel's life and how during her daily train travel to and from her new home she would watch her previous home and her past wonderful life at the same time admiring the couple three houses down. She has in her mind that they are happy - Jess and Jason was what she named them. Then suddenly things are not what they are. I loved the switching of point of views. At the same I wanted to shake Rachel to tell her to stop drinking, stop with those bloody black outs, I wanted to know what she saw/remembered. The Girl On A Train is engrossing and will keep you guessing. I did not see it coming and at the same time toward the end of the book, I was like - why is my least favorite character involved...what...and then I went oh...I get it now.On a personal note: Thank you Melissa for letting me vent via email!

937,Joy Weese Moll,"The Girl on the Train is a thriller with many scenes taking place in view of a commuter train into London. There’s more than one narrator (pay attention to the chapter headings!) but Rachel is our main one. Her life is in shambles, but riding the train each weekday gives her some structure. The people in the houses she sees from the train provide fodder for her fantasies. Fantasy is not reality, though, and reality takes a very dark turn in those houses.More thoughts on my blog, including my love of trains in England (with a photo to prove it!): The Girl on the Train"
938,Lacey Robertson," The novel The Girl On The Train is a modern day psychological thriller by Paula Hawkins. The protagonist in this story is a girl named Rachel who struggles with an alcohol addiction. Her addiction is what eventually led to the demise of her relationship and might have been one of the factors that motivated her husband to cheat. Her husband Tom ended up marrying his mistress Anna and created Rachel's view of the ""perfect family"". Rachel takes the same train into London every morning and obsesses over the couple, Megan and Scott, now living in the house that she was supposed to have the perfect life in. One day, the wife of Scott, Megan, goes missing. On the night of her disappearance, Rachel was having trouble controlling her addiction and blacked out. But, we learn that somehow Rachel plays a key role in solving who committed the murder, but we just don't know what exactly her importance is.  There's many themes portrayed in Paula Hawkins' novel that we can use in our own lives. Drugs and alcohol play a huge role and Rachel shows us how they make you unreliable in crucial moments and destroy you in all parts of your life. We see how the only known witness, Rachel, ends up lying about what she saw that fateful night because she honestly doesn't remember what happened. Betrayal and faith are other themes we see throughout the novel between the main characters and all the love triangles. I think Paula Hawkins wanted the readers to take away the lesson of controlling your addictions and how one bad choice in your life can lead to many negative outcomes. The major struggle in this novel was Rachel and her inability to recall what happened on that night of Megan's disappearance. I noticed that the conflict was mostly person vs. self rather than person vs. person even though it was a murder mystery. What really stood out to me as a ready is that the author gave readers the chance to figure out for ourselves how Rachel was truly involved in the murder. In most thriller novels I've read, the reader finds out who did it before the protagonist does. I found it exciting to be able to use my own reasoning to solve a mystery. ""You have to admit it,"" Tom is saying. ""You've brought this upon yourself. Think about it: if you'd just left us alone, you'd never be in this situation. I wouldn't be in this situation. None of us would. If you hadn't been there that night, if Anna hadn't come running back here after she saw you at the station, then I'd probably have just been able to sort things out with Megan. I wouldn't have lost my temper. I wouldn't have hurt her. None of this would have happened"" (Hawkins 315). This quote from the story by Tom to Rachel is critical. It shows Tom's sociopath side and how he always seemed to turn everything into Rachel's fault. Tom is so manipulative, that is somehow manages to turn his guilt into murdering Meg into the fault of Rachel.  I think it is interesting to get into the mind of these sociopaths like Paula Hawkins does in this psychological thriller and really discover the way they think, manipulate, and their reasoning for their extreme actions. Getting a deeper look into the minds of the characters and killers in this book is what made my experience reading even more interesting. I did not like the main characters as people, but I really don't think you were supposed to. The characters in Paula Hawkins' story weren't meant to make you want to be in the lives, but more so make you apart of their drama. Learning about the characters' past and letting all their secrets unfold is what made the personalities in the story fascinating. Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone with a strong mind who enjoys thrillers and solving their own mysteries. "
939,Harjas,"I'd give this book a solid 4.5 actually, things were going really slow at some parts and at some parts I just wanted everything to slow down. I must say the audio book was a great way of reading or listening to this book because the narrators made it seem all so real! And I'm actually surprised that I liked this book at all because I've never been interested in reading thriller books, I mostly prefer watching the movie versions of this specific genre, but I think that may change now. "
940,Meliana Zaenudin,"This is a very good book. Walau diceritakan dari beragam sisi para perempuan dalam cerita ini, ceritanya sendiri mengalir dan ga bikin bingung. Mudah untuk switch on and off dari satu karakter ke karakter lainnya. Sorry for spoiler ya guys! Ga banyak kok.. I can't help to feel sorry for Rachel, karakter yang digambarkan alkoholik, pengidap depresi, tanpa pekerjaan, dan masih mengharapkan mantan suaminya yang sudah menikah kembali dengan Anna (selingkuhannya waktu masih sama Rachel) dan punya anak. Sama bingung dan jengkelnya dengan Anna waktu dia diteror oleh telepon-telepon Rachel (although not so much dipertengahan setelah gue tahu kalau dia ...).Wondering what Megan feels. Dia itu penyelingkuh kambuhan, get a kicked of excitement from it dan yakin partner selingkuhannya pun sama. Dan Tom.. Saya paling ingin tahu isi kepalanya sebenarnya. Well, it was a good journey with a fast London train, tempat kita bisa mengintip sebentar dan membayangkan kehidupan orang-orang di rumah-rumah sepanjang rel yang kita lalui. Just don't get obsessed by it. "
941,Sedaca,"Rachel her gün trenle Londra'daki işine giderken yol üzerinde gördüğü evleri, manzarayı ezberlemiş ve sürekli takip etmektedir. Özellikle her gün kırmızı ışıkta tren durduğunda, evlerinin önünde durup baktığı ve onların hayatına imreniği bir çift vardır. Onlara isim bile vermiştir ve o muhitteki evlerin iç dizaynlarını bildiği için evin içinde nasıl hareket ettiklerini tahmin etmeye çalışmaya başlamıştır. Her gün gelip geçerken, bir zamanlar aynı caddede kendi mutlu evliliğini hatırlatan bu çifti seyretmektedir. Bir gün yine kırmızı ışıkta çiftin evinin önünde durduklarında kızın başka bir adamı öptüğünü görür ve çok sinirlenir, bir şekilde gidip kızı sarsıp kendine getirme isteği duyar içinde. Ertesi günlerde ise kızın kayıp olduğu haberini alır.. Takip ettiği çifttin Scott-Megan çifti olduğunu ve hayatları hakkında gerçek bilgilerini öğrenmeye başlar. Oraya gidip şüpheli halde olan kocasına karısının başka bir adamı öperken gördüğünü söylemek istese de, aynı semtte oturan eski kocası ve karısının evlerinin yanına yaklaşmayı istememektedir. Kocası Tom'dan boşandıktan sonra işten atılan, alkole kendini veren Rachel'in kendini toplaması hiç kolay olmuyor ve Megan'ın kaybolduğu gece o semtte trenden indiğini hatırlamasının ardından kendini bir anda olayın içinde bulur. Tek sorun Rachel'in bir çok şeyi unutan bir hafızasının olmasıdır. Belkide aslında hatırlanacak bir olayın olmamasıdır !Kayıp kız filmini izlememiş olsaydım belki daha fazla etkilenirdim bu kitaptan. 10/8 diyebiliriz. Kurgusu güzel ve alışılmışın dışında bir roman. Kitap 350 sayfa ama ben 200 sayfayı günlerce süründürdüm, ama son 150 sayfa bir çırpıda bitti. Başlarda Rachel ayrı anlattı, Rachel'in eski kocası Tom'un yeni karısı Anna ayrı anlattı, komşuları Megan ayrı anlattığı için kafam karıştı ama sonunda tüm taşlar yerine oturdu. Gerilim kategorisine değilde, polisiye kategorisine daha çok uyuyor. Fırsatını bulursanız okuyun derim."
942,Nick Iuppa,"The Girl on the TrainThis is a much better story than it seems to be even three quarters of the way through. So, in this one case, even if you dislike the book, please disregard my usual advice to toss it unfinished into the recycle bin or give it to the library, and instead please read all the way to the end. Rachel is a woman who rides the train to work, back and forth between two areas just outside of London. As she rides she drinks (mini bottles of wine, canned gin and tonics), and she looks out at the houses, especially in one particular area where she used to live. She’s interested in one house because her ex-husband, Tom, still lives there. And, looking at another 2 doors down, she’s started to fantasize about the relationship between the man and woman who occupy the place. She thinks the woman (Megan) is so beautiful and ideal; her husband (Scott) is so loving and protective. Ex-husband, Tom, and his current wife have a new baby. They seem very happy too. Rachel regrets this, really, and she still misses Tom very much. In fact she keeps calling him all the time. He hates it. That’s the start: five characters (add the psychiatrist of one member of the group) and you have all the main players. There are a few hangers on… but this is clearly the principal cast. And, boy, what these guys do to each other and themselves emotionally, mentally and even physically is really hard to handle. Of course, it all evolves so slowly, told usually through the frequently drunken eyes of Rachel – The Girl On The Train, but also augmented by the remembrances of the other two women. The subtext of the whole story is honesty or the lack thereof. Is anyone honest? Or is this really a story about deceit and lying?Four stars. If you can cope with this gang of nutcases through the whole book you deserve what you get… a really great ending. OBTW: the audio book is wonderful. The readings (by three different actresses with three very distinct voices) are very strong, real, and just… damn unnerving. "
943,Marykipp,The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins kept my attention until the very end.
944,Antoinette,"Once you board this train, It's hard to get off! A great beach read! A book for lovers of thrillers. I enjoyed all the twists and turns till I got to the conclusion. It's hard to like any of the characters, be they male or female, but you do feel pity for Rachel- a woman who can't let go of her ex husband and who is drunk so often. You do root for her- you want her to kick her alcohol, her ex and move on.It's easy to see how she gets caught up in the lives of Megan and Scott from the glimpses from the train- they look like the couple she wishes she and her ex were. We all fantasize about strangers at times, make up stories about them. The author writes well- she keeps the plot moving-she keeps you interested throughout. Really enjoyed the ride! "
945,Marc,"I was in two minds as to whether I should read this or not as previous novels I have tried, with lavish recommendations and positive reviews, fell rather flat. However it was the premise that drew me into this as my partner and I have often idly speculated about houses and gardens we have viewed from passing trains. The inevitable comparisons to ""Gone Girl"" have been made but rather miss the point. While there are some minor similarities, it's the differences to that book that make this a worthwhile read. What makes this stand out for me was the very successful voicing of three main characters and the often unsympathetic way in which they not only are viewed, but view themselves and others. The development of each character and the plot through their own thoughts, actions and timelines is well paced although I sometimes had to return to the beginning of each chapter to get the date of the chapter to place it in context which was one of the few irritants of the book.The mystery at the centre of the book, the disappearance of the woman that Rachel, the main protagonist, views from the train window is a well designed plot device. While it is the cornerstone of the interactions of all the players in the book, it serves to expose each of the main characters personalities, foibles, weaknesses, strengths and uncover the distasteful aspects of each of their lives. It is the very flaws of the characters that holds the plot up and makes it such a fascinating read. The twist of the whodunnit was something I had worked out very early on but was eager to continue reading to see how it would be revealed.All in all this was a compelling read, free from Hollywood scripted heroes and heroines and based around character flaws and suburban living in the UK. It's very ordinariness in an extraordinary situation was a very strong point. There was no celebration of flaws, nor tacit acceptance, and the failures of each of the characters was writ large within the plot. Like life, the denouement was not clean nor spectacular, but messy and difficult. So apart from the flipping back and forth to ensure I understood the timeline, which may be a flaw in the way I read rather than the mechanics of the book itself, this was a very enjoyable read. Paula Hawkins has a very good grasp of the flawed psyche that makes up modern life, and writes it very convincingly. I was kept enthralled throughout and rarely skimmed. I hope to see more from this author and soon"
946,Lara Ryan,"This was certainly an interesting psychological thriller. You know you have been in the situation where you are playing a mind game with yourself to pass the time on the train, or the airport, or whatever. Making up stories about the people that are around you - and even better when you see those people on a regular basis. This books delves into this kind of mind game and explores the tricks that your mind can play on you, as well as discusses the very true facts of alcoholism. Mixing your mind games with what alcoholism can do to your memory and you get a taste of what this book explores."
947,Mark,"Did she, didn't she- was it him, her? an accident. Is she okay. All the questions bounced through my head as the girl on the train lived out her drama. "
948,Perri,"I get the comparisons to Gone Girl, most of the characters are thoroughly unlikable. The ending is more palatable, but the writing is not as good as GG - four stars riveting read! "
949,Ellen,Definitely un-puttdownable! 
950,Net,"Rachel is a commuter. She catches the same train and sits in the same carriage every day. Her train stops at the same signals and she finds herself watching the inhabitants of the trackside house. Giving them names and occupations and creating ""lives"" for them. Rachel used to live in that street with her ex husband. Before alcohol broke down her marriage and before her life fell apart. The book is told from the POV of three women. Rachel, the alcoholic commuter, Anna, the new wife who provided a child and Megan, the arty neighbour who Rachel always sees from the train. As Rachel sinks deeper into alcoholism the book becomes harder to read. She is more incoherent and no longer knows what or why she is doing things. Then Megan disappears and Rachel knows that she was in the area when it happened. A blackout leaves her unable to help the police despite her good intentions. This is a thriller with a twist in the same way that Gone Girl captured the imagination. As a commuter myself I could relate a bit to the story and the ""snooping"" that Rachel had done from the train. It is a well thought out story and a fast but very enjoyable read. "
951,Mary,"The inside flap of the book cover calls ""The Girl on the Train"" ""compulsively readable,"" and to date I have yet to hear a better description of the book. A ""Gillian Flynn""-esque read, I thought that the disturbed unravelling of the plot and unconventional and unreliable characters set a decent and, again, disturbing pace for the book. I was initially drawn in by the brief synopsis in the book cover and found myself wondering when the prophesied ""big moment"" was going to occur in the beginning of the read. And when said ""big moment"" did occur, I wasn't struck by it's seemingly earth shattering realization. Only when the book, and characters, developed did the whole read become a twisted puzzle with pieces only fitting in to their spots at surprisingly random moments. I enjoyed that the realizations were on my own as I uncovered the developing storyline and not laid out in front of me as an obvious go-to. I am excited for Hawkins' career and her next release!I would have preferred to give a rating of 4.5 stars...but Goodreads."
952,Eve Visconti,"Wow, this was a real page turner, particularly as the story progressed. The Girl on the Train has all the elements in a great, fast-paced thriller. Most intriguing was the portrayal of the mind of an alcoholic. The plot is full of twists and turns and keeps you guessing. Just who can you trust - is there anyone out there who isn't lying, cheating, or even murdering? The reader does feel sorry for the main character, until she too becomes a suspect. No one's immune from scrutiny. Who's account of events can you believe? What's real? What's fantasy? A very interesting first thriller from Paula Hawkins. I kept wondering who would play whom in the film that will likely be made from this best seller. "
953,Meg,Fast paced good book - a great take on vacation book!
954,Mel,"Wow, downloaded this one yesterday morning, finished it by nightfall. Loved it. What fun she had with the narration. Completely unreliable. Great page-turner. Liked it much better than Gone Girl. Highly recommend!"
955,Marie-Michèle,"Encore un peu troublé de toute cette histoire... captivante du début à la fin. Un roman très bien écris, un suspense bien dosé et des personnages tous plus inquiétants que les autres. Je donne un 4 ⭐️ bien mérité!"
956,Andrea Larson,"The Girl on the Train is a twisty psychological thriller featuring some very unreliable narrators. Rachel is a washed-up, alcoholic thirty-something who creates a fantasy about a couple she sees out the window of her daily train ride into London. In her mind, they're a happy, loving, perfect pair ... until one day, the woman turns up missing. By coincidence (or maybe not), this couple lives down the street from Rachel's ex-husband, his new wife, and baby. With seemingly good intentions, Rachel manages to insert herself into the investigation of the woman's disappearance, but realizes she may have played more of a role in what happened than she thinks. The story unfolds through the point of view of three women: Rachel, Megan (the woman who disappeared), and Anna(the wife of Rachel's ex). Megan is keeping secrets from her husband; Rachel can't stop screwing up her life; and Anna just wants Rachel to go away and leave her alone. Each woman's unique personality and point of view opens up a new window into what happened to Megan, and as the story develops, we realize that they are more connected than we originally thought. The technique really keeps the plot rolling and the suspense building -- this is a book that is hard to put down! (Note: the time frame jumps back and forth between the present and the past, which confused me for a while until I started paying attention to the dates. So watch out for that.)The Girl on the Train is poised to be another popular suspense novel in the vein of Gone Girl. (Frankly, I liked Girl on the Train better because I didn't have to put up with such despicable characters!) If you're looking for a dark, fast-paced novel with lots of surprises, try this book."
957,Stacia,"Without giving anything away, this is often compared to ""Gone Girl"" and I'm not sure that's a fair comparison. Yes, it's a mystery involving infidelity and an unreliable narrator. But that's where the similarities ended for me.This book is told from the POV of three women. There's Rachel, the alcoholic ex-wife. She witnessed something, but she was too drunk to remember and nobody believes her anyways. Throughout the book, I wanted her to pull it together so badly. There's Anna, the current wife, who just wants Rachel to leave them alone. And there's Megan, the neighbor, who goes missing. The three women are all given a fair amount of complexity to their stories, maybe Anna the least of all. She doesn't get much backstory beyond her affair with Rachel's then-husband, leading to Rachel's divorce. The timelines are somewhat jumbled, which was confusing at first. I kept trying to match up dates in my head and eventually gave up, allowing Megan's timeline to exist in the somewhat recent past from the others. I found the ending mostly satisfying (more than ""Gone Girl""). Things seemed mostly wrapped up by the time we reached the conclusion, though I spent most of the book with absolutely no idea where we were going or how we were getting there. "
958,Gabriela Corso,"Acabei esse livro aos prantos! Li em só 3 dias e ainda não sei bem o que pensar, só que o sentimento de melancolia ainda paira em mim."
959,Debby,"The only reason that I can't give this book five stars is that Rachel frustrated the heck out of me. Maybe it's because I've had the misfortune of dealing with an alcoholic in my own life, and I have no patience for drunks. That might sound insensitive of me, but alcoholism affects those who love them-- and I have been scarred by someone like her. Rachel is a mess. She can't get over her husband leaving her for another woman. She's a stalker. She's a victim, and she's pretty pathetic (in my view). She's pretending to go to a job she's been fired from, riding the training every day and living vicariously through a couple she sees each day as the train stops. There's a murder. She's blacked out and can't remember what happened. I love a good mystery/thriller, but this book didn't quite deliver the mystery for me. I'm not saying I didn't like the book, but it's one star short of ""exciting"" for me. Good narrator, though."
960,Marilynn,Good read. Was on the NY best sellers list
961,Víctor,"This is a really good book. My heart was always beating hard, Hawkins (the writer) always made me feel part of this story. I gave it only 4 stars just because the end should be better.."
962,Dru,"3,5Se lee rápido pero hasta la mitad me ha resultado muy lento. Luego coge más ritmo y el final es predecible. Está bien pero no es para tanto como lo ponen."
963,Sónia,"Muito se tem dito e escrito sobre este livro. Muitos têm falado que o seu sucesso reside na publicidade extensiva que teve, o que não nego, mas não creio que seja só esse o motivo. Os leitores gostam de obras que lhes toquem na alma. Por mim falo. Um autor pode ser de renome, elogiado pelos maiores críticos e escrever obras que nada dizem às pessoas. Pode usar dos recursos estilísticos mais elaborados, mas se não tiver ""alma"", se não tocar o leitor de nada vale. Esta é a velha conversa de que só o que é escrito por autores de certas elites (e, caramba, em Portugal vê-se tanto disso...) é que é bom. Porém, muitos se esquecem de que esta é a primeira obra da autora. E, de facto, estamos perante uma estória construída de forma extremamente inteligente e que conquista o leitor em absoluto, pese embora o início algo monótono. Isso e a escrita demasiado linear (tanto pode ser motivo para se gostar menos da obra como para lê-la com mais fulgor) foram os motivos pelos quais não atribuí cotação máxima.Não é um policial nem um thriller psicológico, na verdadeira acepção da palavra. Achei mais um ""tratado"" sobre mentes perturbadas, bem como isso se pode traduzir em acções. Neste caso, na pessoa de ""mulheres"" traídas e abandonadas, como se de um objecto se tratassem. Isso o leitor só conseguirá perceber mais para o fim. E mais poderia eu abordar mas tiraria toda a piada...A Rapariga no Comboio é uma obra que cativa o leitor, que faz com que, a dada altura, este comece a sentir as ""dores"" de uma das personagens e é exímia em voltas e reviravoltas. Lê-se num ápice, dá que pensar e mantém-nos agarrados à leitura. Gostei muito e recomendo vivamente!"
964,Kate Coleman,"I was on the edge of my [train] seat this whole book. Paula Hawkins has written a very engrossing and suspenseful story with The Girl on the Train. Rachel is a divorced and well-meaning, but seemingly disillusion, out-of-a-job drunk who rides the train into London every day. The highlight of the trip every day is watching what she thinks is the perfectly married couple whom she has named ""Jess and Jason."" This couple turns out to be not what she imagined, and between Megan, the mysterious couple, and Rachel's ex-husband and his new wife, this story will have you pulling out your hair, yelling at the characters, and mentally exhausted. What a train wreck, I mean, train ride."
965,Betsy Wolf,"Likes: -PAGE.TURNER. Couldn't put it down-Everybody up in here is an unreliable narrator, kept it very interesting.-LONDON, trains, British-speak-Twists & turns -Rachel compulsively makes the worst decisions but it made for a good story -figured it out, but didn't detract from the story-Great insight into how much we can't know about others from the outside...every one is fighting a hard battle-Was a bit curious about how everybody compared this to Gone Girl, it was not nearly as nasty but just as riveting.Dislikes:-Lots of heavy life issues, may or may not be triggery for some people. Does not romanticize the issues & isn't overly descriptive with them."
966,Buse Arslan,Kitabı gerçekten sevdim. Karakterlerin hiçbirisine sevgi beslemesemde olaylar heyecanlıydı ve merak ettiriyordu. Biraz yoğundu yani 50. sayfadayım sanki 100 sayfalık olay oldu gibi geldi. Bide katil beklediğim kişi çıktı :')
967,Kate Wrenshall,"Definitely a page turner, but not my favorite book. The characters needed more substance. "
968,Kayla Barletta,"The Girl on the Train is an interesting story that I was unsure I was going to enjoy due to a mild plot which lacked lots of excitement. As the book began, it seemed to be a repetition of a woman named Rachel's ride to and from work every morning and evening, however after the first chapter, the narrators changed and showed a different characters perspective. She passes a strip of Suburban homes, and one of them used to be the house she lived in with her ex husband. Every day she takes the train it reminds her of the life she recently has lost. She also gets a brief glimpse into the lives of a new couple, and she begins to follow and create personas for the strangers. As the book went on, the reader begins to realize that Rachel is an avid alcoholic who is still grieving over her divorce. Her husband unexpectedly cheated on her, and evidently she is still in love with him. She drunk calls him and is a major threat to his new family. She is stuck in this grief that she cannot overcome and uses alcohol as a coping mechanism. As she examines the perfect life of the couple who lives by the train tracks, she discovers the woman kissing another man, and recognizes in those short few seconds that their lives are not exactly as they seem. Because she is familiar with the pain that an affair brings someone, she goes to the police with this information, and gets tangled into the lives of everyone involved in the investigation. It is compelling to see the narrators lives slowly intertwine as the book goes on. I somewhat sympathize Rachel for all of the misfortunes that she has exerienced in her life. Nobody should have to face a brutal divorce like she did, however she makes me so angry that she cannot get her act together and fix her life. I want to go into the book and stop her from buying more and more alcohol, and I want to bring her to an AA meeting. It is hard to sympathize a drunk who makes no efforts to fix her life, and that made the book somewhat frustrating to read. I think that it is interesting that she lives through this couples perfect life, yet it gets ruined just like hers did. Hawkins does an excellent job making a character affect the reader, as well as creating suspense. I deffinetly recommend this book to anyone interested in an unpredictable thriller because once I got into it, I couldn't put it down."
969,Stacey,"This was great! I'm glad I didn't start hearing the comparisons to Gone Girl until after I'd finished this novel. This is not Gone Girl. In fact I really didn't see any similarities other than the fact that this is a mystery/thriller. This book can stand on it's own two feet without the Gone Girl references. The main character, Rachel is a complete and utter mess but underneath it all, a good person. She has some problems that she's trying to work through, while trying to piece together events from a night she doesn't remember. There were some plot twists I didn't see coming and there were elements I kinda wondered about while reading but it all made sense in the end. A highly compelling read!"
970,Glenda," Rachel Watson has spent the last few years stumbling through life in a booze-filled depression ever since her husband left her for another woman. Now she wiles away her days riding the commuter train to and from London, despite having been fired from her job months ago. The train makes a daily stop by her old neighborhood and it is here she spies a couple appearing to be living a perfect life from a beautiful home. She begins to fantasize about the couple, inventing little lives and backstories for them to keep her mind off her own troubles. Rachel witnesses something from the train that upsets her more than it should, and when Megan goes missing, she believes she has key evidence. She goes to the police but the police dismiss her as a drunken, unreliable witness. So she takes things into her own hands. I liked hearing the story from three different people and how the stories overlapped and intertwined. There wasn't much to like as far as characters were concerned. I felt sorry for Rachel as she had lost all that was important to her. I felt something for Megan too--but she was the cause of some of her problems. Anna and Tom were something else and until the very end, I wasn't sure what Anna would do. A quick suspenseful read with lots of twists and turns. "
971,Lacey Michael,This was a fun little read- kept me guessing until the last 1/4 of the book. It didn't get too deep into the depravity of murder- which was kind of nice. The main character's struggle with alcoholism was painful to read and I found myself caught up in wanting her to succeed. I agree with other reviewers: this was not another thriller along the lines of Gone Girl. It was refreshingly its own story. It did remind me more of Rear Window- except without the male hero.I hope Hawkins writes more thrillers!!
972,Leigh,Ok. That was a rollercoaster ride! I do see why this was being compared to Gone Girl. This book kept me guessing and guessing! Everyone is a suspect. And then they weren't. And then they were victims. And then I don't know anymore! This book played with my mind and my emotions! I need to take a breather...
973,Julie - Book Hooked Blog,"WritingIf you haven't heard about this one, I feel like you must be living under a rock. Or at least avoiding the ""books like Gone Girl"" craze. I feel like you can't review this book without saying the words ""Gone Girl"", although the books are honestly quite different. They're similar only in that both are psychological thrillers with a slow building tension followed by a surprise ending with plenty of red herrings thrown in to keep you guessing. I should probably just C&P this paragraph and add it to every single psychological thriller I read because I do tend to gravitate towards them and you absolutely cannot avoid a comparison if you publish in the genre.That said, the writing here stands on its own without needing to be compared to anything else. It's full of characters who are so difficult to like, but who you just can't stop reading about. They're all perfectly loathsome, and still perfectly believable, because they're horrible in very normal ways. The plotting moves quickly, but the tension builds slowly in a very smart way. Having an unreliable narrator totally works in this case. And the ending is terrifying in a very Hitchcockian sense.Entertainment ValueI was totally caught up in the story and in learning what was Rachel really saw and what she only imagined. It kept me up late, which is the mark of a good thriller, and I was guessing until the last few chapters. Completely enthralling and something that I think most people will find themselves happily caught up in.OverallIf you're a fan of unreliable narrators, psychological suspense, slow building dread and tension, or, yes, if you're looking for something similar to Gone Girl in its domestic setting and love to hate characters, this is the book for you. Nothing stuck out to me as particularly graphic, but there is some violence and language, if I recall correctly. Obviously, it wasn't anything I found over the top or offensive or even memorable.Thanks to my local library for providing me with a copy!"
974,Raz,"I gave this book 4 stars for the parts written from Rachel's perspective. I thought these parts were the most believable and interesting - she is certainly a flawed character and the holes in her memory from alcohol add an interesting element to the familiar theme of a narrator with an unreliable memory. The author paced the book well and took care in describing the houses, the train journey, and Rachel's lethargy and depression so that I didn't feel we were simply racing between confrontations. I enjoyed reading a character who often made bad decisions but also made good ones - I hate reading a thriller just wishing characters would confide in someone, or go to the police. It was better for feeling that Rachel was trying to do the right thing but was letting herself down despite her best intentions.I didn't enjoy the parts of the book written from Megan's perspective nearly as much, and Scott's character seemed bizarrely inconsistent (although I suppose he was meant to be unhinged after his wife's disappearance and generally jealous).I did feel that the hints at the reveal came a bit too early and were a bit too obvious. Also the final 'confession' scene wasn't as believable or slowly drawn as the other parts. Overall I did really enjoy this book and I'd be interested to read more by this author."
975,Kymberley,"Pick a comfy chair and pour a glass of wine!. This book grabs you, pulls you in and holds you hostage! I read to the wee hours, desperately wanting to find out what happens but at the same time not wanting it to end.I loved the rotating voices and not knowing who to trust. I used to hate books with sketchy lead characters; now I love them. I love that Rachel is flawed, a liar and a drunk. She became real. I didn't like her but I was rooting for her. Rachel, Anna and Megan all tied together and lost at the same time. It was fascinating to see how the characters were developed and the story built.Rachel is lost, alone and riding the train into London - to a job she was fired from. She people watches out the train window, and one day sees something that startles her. Should she report it? Did she really see it happen? Whenever I thought I had it figured out - I was wrong.I held of reading this one - thinking if its like Gone Girl I can do with NOT reading it but I am glad I did."
976,Lindsay Seddon,"This book has been compared to Gone Girl and Before I Go to Sleep and that's absolutely spot on, it's a perfect blend of the two, especially with the gaps in vital memories and the feeling that you haven't been told everything about the main characters. I couldn't guess what was going to happen right up until the very end. The reveal was great and the last few scenes were really tense. There was more action than I was expecting from this kind of novel, which was surprising as most of the commentary on the mystery at hand came from the outsider's point of view, which at times was questionable at best. "
977,beca  kers,"3,5.Me ha gustado. La primera parte se me hizo un poco lenta, pero luego iban pasando cosas que te enganchan. Sí que es verdad que llega un punto en que ya sospechas como puede terminar, pero luego llegas al final y te confirma lo que pensabas, pero no sin antes sorprenderte de nuevo. En el final, me ha faltado reafirmar más el desenlace de algún personaje.También me ha gustado como los trenes y las vías estaban presentes durante toda la novela. "
978,Ezgi,"www.kitapezgisi.comGenelde bu kadar fazla reklamı yapılan “alın, kesinlikle okuyun!” denilen kitaplar başta bana itici gelir. Gerçi blog için okumam lazım, yorumlamam lazım, tavsiye etmem ya da etmemem lazım, ama yine de tercih meselesi bu.Trendeki Kız kitabını çıktığının üçüncü günü almamın nedeni (o sırada elimde okuduğum bir kitap olduğu için ilk gün alamadım) konusunun çok ilgi çekici olmasıydı. Gerilim, polisiye, bir yazarın ilk kitabı ve Goodreads’te, Amazon’da v.s. en çok satılan kitap. Bir de itiraf etmek gerekirse kapak tasarımını çok sevdim :)Çok kitap okuyan birisiyseniz kitabın arkasındaki; “Nefesleri kesen bir ilk roman. En dikkatli okurlar bile, şaşırmaktan kendilerini alamayacaklar.” yorumu sizi de gaza getirebilir. Başladım kitaba haydi bakalım el mi yaman bey mi yaman diyerek.Kitabın konusunu az çok herkes biliyordur, reklamlar, tanıtımlar sayesinde öğrenmiştir diye düşünüyorum. Her gün aynı trene, genelde aynı saatlerde binen Rachel bir çifti izlemektedir. Bir süre sonra bu çifti bütün ülke tanıdığı zaman yaşanan olaylara bir şekilde dahil olma kararı alır, sonrasında olaylar sürükleyici bir hale gelir. İçerik ile ilgili anlatılabilecek en ufak bir şey bile kitap ile ilgili ipucu vereceği için konu ile ilgili söyleyecek daha fazla şeyim yok ne yazık ki.Tren yolculuğu ile başlayan kitap, baştan sona kadar neredeyse aynı tempoda devam ediyor. Ama sonlara doğru o hız öyle bir artıyor ki, son 150 sayfa kadarını tek gecede okudum. Bir yerden sonra bir bakıyorsunuz ki kitabı elinizden bırakmanız imkansız bir hale gelmiş. Polisiye tarzda, akılda soru işaretleri oluşturması açısından kurgu mükemmel, tam olayları çözdüm derken hayal kırıklığına uğruyorsunuz. Yazı akıcı, çeviri oldukça başarılı.İthaki Yayınlarını da ayrıca tebrik etmek istiyorum, bir kitabın bu kadar arkasında durarak, bu kadar kuşku ile yaklaşan kişileri bile tatmin etmeyi başarabildikleri için.Ve artık hiçbir yolculuk eskisi gibi olmayacak okurlar için…"
979,Lavi,Just finished this and wow! This was a page turner. Could not put it down until I got to the end. I kept thinking along the way that I've figured out how it was going to end and still didn't expect that ending. Every character is broken in their own way and you feel sad for each one of them. Sometimes good people get in bad situations that go from bad to worse and there seems to be no way to swim to the shore. Really loved it. It would make a good vacation read. 
980,Kevin McAllister,"This one was quite the troubling read. While it was clear right from the start that the main character Rachel had some major mental issues. The other main characters Megan, Anna, Tom, & Scott appeared to be upstanding pillars of society. But little by little these characters also demonstrated their dark and deeply disturbed sides. It makes one wonder just how many apparently normal people out there are in reality hiding deep inner pain, despair, and conflict."
981,Ade,"The Girl on the Train is the epitome of pure suspense and tension. The book is written from the point of view of three female characters but the heroine and the main voice of this story is definitely Rachel. She is the only character for whom the reader is supposed to experience empathy because she goes through a lot while trying to figure out how her actions connect with the disappearance of Megan/Jess. What upset me the most was Rachel becoming everyone's punching bag. She was constantly insulted, humiliated, undermined and considered the lowest of the low and instead of standing up for herself she just sat back and took the punches. (view spoiler)[ Years of emotional manipulation and physical abuse damaged her confidence and caused her feelings of worthlessness.  (hide spoiler)] And yes, Rachel had a low self esteem and was too emotionally dependent on men but she was also persistent, observant and tenacious in her quest to discover the truth that would finally set her free and allow her to move on. "
982,Ada,"Solid 4.5 This was a great audio. I wanted to shout at every character in this book! Geez Louise, that was stressful."
983,Eren,"I had this on a ""to read"" list for a while. I hesitated because it was compared to Gone Girl and I absolutely hated Gone Girl. I finally gave this a shot. It's a great read. Suspenseful and messes with your mind! Rachel is an alcoholic. She had it all. A great job, a great husband, a great house. She failed though, and her life shattered. Now, she takes the 8:06 AM train and the 5:54 PM train. Everyday she rides the train, she sees her old house. Saw the curtains change to pink when her ex husband and his new wife had a baby. She tries not to look at it though. She's focused her attention on the house 4 houses down. She's made a life for these people. See's the husband, doting on the wife. The wife, an artist, always on the terrace or drawing. On a Saturday night, drunk, she goes back to that road. Blacks out and doesn't remember what happened. The next day, she learns that the woman she sees at the house every day has gone missing. This story takes you on so many twists and turns. You start to wonder who did it, how they did it and if she's even dead or not. I very much recommend this novel!"
984,Max III,"A little predictable, but still a really fun read. Highly recommended. "
985,Macy Halladay,"I had no idea what this book was about when I started besides it being about a girl on a train. I'm a girl and I really like trains so I thought why not. It took me till about half way through the book and much confusion to realize that it was a thriller. Like everyone is out of their minds, worse than Gone Girl thriller. Then I thought it was pretty good..."
986,Jen Campbell,"A case of the right book at the right time, I think. Really kept me gripped - didn't want to put it down, and I didn't find it predictable. "
987,Harold,I think the hype ruined the story just a little for me. It was greatly written though and I still enjoyed it. I was expecting a bit more but it's still a great mystery story.
988,Nadisha,"Wow! ""Page-turner"" doesn't begin to describe how thrilling this novel reads; I walked around my house with the book open because I was so entrenched in the plot details that I didn't want to hit pause. I read it straight through, feeling a mixture of nausea and excitement with each page. There wasn't a moment of boredom, which, for a 325 page book, is quite an achievement. Even more invigorating than the story's constant action are the characters themselves. The men in this story are horrifying, not only because of what they do in the story but because of how utterly realistic they are. I appreciate this because Hawkings veers off the traditional two-person/one-enemy story and truly confuses the reader by illustrating misogyny, sex, and power as universal concepts in this small and quiet town. Your eyes are constantly fleeting from one relationship to the next, deciphering the character's every move and attempting to piece it all together as the pieces get more and more multiplied. The women, too, are equally fascinating. I'm on Rachel's side, but I can't trust her. If I was a character in this story, I could easily see how everything she says is unreliable and how she looks as a drunk to everyone around her, even herself. However, I also see her pain and her sorrow, and I sympathize with it. There are moments in her thoughts and volitions where you see her intelligence, particularly through her occasional analysis of her friends' relationships. She's a smart girl, clouded and buried underneath so much. Anna, too, is startling. For a while, I kept mixing up her and Megan, because the two are such strong and internally confusing people that it almost got hard to keep track, but right up until the end, I remained puzzled and intrigued. Like I said before, not a moment of boredom. Some commenters have compared have compared this book to ""Gone Girl"", and I agree and disagree. Like ""Gone Girl"", it was fast-paced and difficult to put down. However, unlike ""Gone Girl"", I left with no disappointment. It was not painfully predictable, and its thrill lay in more than just the action. The characters themselves were far more real, and it kept that realism and intrigue right up until its end. That's not to say I was blown away by its end; Hawkins definitely unraveled it at a pace that allowed you follow along and foreshadow. Yet even at its end, Hawkins throws in another twist, lengthening my intrigue and appreciation even after the last page."
989,Jamie,"I wanted to not like this book. I resisted reading it. But once I started, I was hooked, and couldn't stop!"
990,Fleur,"A shocking, fast-paced thriller that can't be missed!The girl on the train follows a young woman called Rachel, every day she takes the same train and observes the same couple, sometimes she even feels like she knows them personally. However one day she sees something shocking and everything is turned upside down. This psychological thriller is different than every book I have read before, most of the time there is at least one person in a book that you like, here this is not the case; every character is absolutely terrible. In this case, it actually worked in advantage of the story. Every tiny part of the story was well-plotted, as well as the character development was very well-done. The story worked very addictive, I wasn't able to put it down! However after I read approximately half of the book I started to expect the ending, the ending itself felt a little flat and cut-short in my opinion. Which is too bad because it did disappoint me a little bit after such a great story! All in all, I think the plot is great, original and very addictive. The story itself is amazingly-written; the twists and turns fit exactly. Only the ending didn't fully satisfy me, which doesn't mean that I didn't like it at all, I would love to read more from this author!"
991,Lisa Kay,"★★★★✩ Nobody to root for in this book, but the mystery is pretty good."
992,Lynn G.,"How is it possible to despise every character in a book and still like the story? Perhaps that's the wonder of The Girl on the Train  . Each character is fatally flawed. None has any redeeming characteristics and, yet, they come together in a well timed, tensely paced, suspenseful and dark plot that slowly and tantalizingly pulls the reader into its web. A real page-turner."
993,Sabrina,Wow. That was like being on an intense roller coaster. Or being caught in the eye of tornado. Or being inside a twisted ball of yarn. What an incredible story. 
994,Chris Stanley,"Another book filled with unsavoury characters and liars. I couldn't warm to them. Even the Police Family Liaison Officer was a sneering bitch. BUT the main monologue from Rachel rings true, full of self doubt and self loathing and boozy blackouts. A few twists and turns, and a red herring; I enjoyed it!"
995,Sadie ,"This was right up my alley and will likely be among my favorite thrillers this year. Damaged characters galore (and some you can't help but have sympathy for), internal dialogue that had me highlighting and a plot that makes you think about how quick we are to judge people and how little we really know about them. There are a few things i would change but overall it was a quick and creepy read."
996,Rena Mcgee-helms,"I don't generally tolerate books very well that move from present to past regularly. Nor do I usually like for the ""narrator"" to switch from one character to another. Both of these characteristics were in ""The Girl on the Train"" and it did not bother me in the least. It took a little bit of time to really get into the story but that may have been because I had limited time to listen (audio version) at any given time. The farther into the story, the more intense and involved the story line became and was definitely in thriller mode towards the end. It being the audio version, I really l liked hearing the book with the British accents! Really enjoyed this one!"
997,Kathie Gibson,"My family likes to play a ""game"" when we go camping. At state parks, campers come with their tents, trailers, pets and camp chairs. We call our game ""Sociology"". We try to guess what the campers around us do for their day jobs, what their life situation is or is not. We rarely find out if our guesses are good or not, but in The Girl on the Train, the lead character starts the story out by imagining what the lives are like of a couple she sees from the train stop. She then becomes involved with the couple as the story is actually told by three different characters. Well written different points of view. I was able to figure out who the bad guy was early on but kept thinking there would be another twist,but my guess was correct. "
998,J,"I'm really proud of myself for figuring it all out less than halfway through the book. I'm not normally good at that, but I managed it with this one. I can see why it's so popular. It sucked me in, even though I don't normally read psychological thrillers."
999,Rose Ann,"4.5 starsNormally, I would have read this so much quicker!A definite page turner. I started to figure it out close to the end. But even still it kept me turning those pages!What a messed up bunch of characters!Everyone has a story, that's true.I would love to see this made into a movie!!"
1000,Débora Viegas,"Acho que consigo entender o alarido à volta deste livro. Não foi excelente, mas foi um bom livro. Por isso, posso dizer que gostei dele.3,5 *"
1001,Basmah,a page turner but I was expecting a better ending from all the hype around this book xD
1002,Clare Dowling,"An unusual and initially unsympathetic central character in Rachel, who ticks none of the usual boxes. But nobody is who they seem at first, and much else is also in dispute, including what really happened during Rachel's alcohol-induced blackouts. It's one of these blackouts that forms the central mystery here and keeps you turning those pages. A very original story, great setting, lots of suspense with characters that stick in your head."
1003,Ghazaleh,عالی بود، این کتاب از معدود کتاب های سبک جناییه که خوشم اومد ازش. واقعا تعریف هایی که شنیده بودم بی جهت نبود.خیلی وقت بود کتابی رو نخونده بودم که اینقدر هیجان داشته باشم برای دونستن آخرش.
1004,Abigail Yeazell,"Well, I finished it. This was a book out of my comfort zone of genres, but I am glad I read it. I do not suggest this book to people who like fluff. The story keeps you on your toes until the very end. "
1005,Jennifer Symonds,"Great read, suspenseful and twisty like Gone Girl."
1006,Neelakshi Chakraborty,"Ever wondered what it would feel like to step into the shoes of a couple whom you have admired from afar? in fact, ever wondered what it would be like to get entangled in a disappearance-and-murder case,the likes of which you have only read about or watched on TV so far?Well, this novel is about all this- and more. It is the equivalent of a murder mystery cum psychological thriller cum suspense drama, and embedded in it is a wonderful testament to the idea that voyeurism can yield rich and interesting content. So we have Rachael, the classic unreliable narrator - but one with the added twist of being an alcoholic, drunkenly slipping from one disastrous encounter to the other. Can her narration really be taken at face value, especially as she suffers from blackouts and memory losses and a host of other problems? Well, the layers to the novel just make it more interesting; it is not a typical whodunit neither is it a meandering tale into the inner workings of a specific character's mind. Instead it is fast-paced human drama and written from the points of view of 3 characters, all of them equally slippery and ambiguous. Beneath the particulars of the story itself is the larger inquiry into the enduring question of whether we say what we see and hear or what we feel and remember. A page-turner, a gripping thriller with twists and turns on every page and an interesting insight into relationships, this book is a must-read and a collectible. "
1007,Joanne,"Read this over a weekend with my bookclub friends. Fast paced, well done. Good, not great. Hard to like the characters. "
1008,Ava,"This novel is climbing the best seller charts and is creating a lot of buzz. It is likely to be made into a movie as well. All this talk about the book made me order it right away.The story is intriguing. Rachel is a mess. She got divorced two years ago when her husband, Tom, left her for another woman. She finds it hard to blame him for the divorce. She was a drunkard and out of control. Any man in his sane mind would be disgusted with her. Her drinking problem made her lose her job. She lives with a school friend, Cathy. She cannot afford to let Cathy know that she has lost her job, for the fear of being turned out of the room she rents in Cathy's flat.So, she makes a daily trip to London on the train, keeping up a pretense of going to work. The problem is, the train stops at Witney station. This is where she used to live with Tom, and where Tom now lives with Anna, his new wife. She lives with the pain of passing by her old house every day. She finds herself fixating on another house close to hers, and often looking at a handsome young couple on their terrace.Rachel makes up stories about this golden couple, and calls them Jess and Jason. She is convinced that they live an ideal life, full of love and laughter. Until one day when she discovers that the wife is missing. She catches the story in the papers and thinks she has a clue as to who killed her, from what she had seen on the terrace one day.She goes to see the police, and tell them what she knows. She also falls back into obsessing about her ex-husband, and spirals more and more out of control, falling into an irreversible pattern of drinking.She finds herself pursuing the mystery of the missing woman and getting more and more into a mess.The story is told in the voices of three women, Rachel, Anna and Megan (the missing woman). The story draws you in immediately, and, despite its dark tone, you find it is hard to let it go.The women dominate the novel, the voice and the opinion is all theirs. Even the police, who are investigating the mystery, seem to be rather subdued. If the women had not kept stirring the issue up with their actions, I am afraid, the mystery of missing Megan would have dwindled away in case files.The book has been compared to Gillian Flynn's ""Gone Girl"". Both books are full of dark, damaged characters. But there is hardly any other resemblance. The Girl on the Train is definitely not a copycat novel. In fact, I liked it much more than ""Gone Girl"".The novel moves at a steady pace. Two or three suspects are insinuated at so we may keep wondering about the culprit. I am afraid I kind of 'saw' who the villain was. But even so, it was hard to imagine the 'why' of the action. The end was a lot more dark than I anticipated, and I went away from the book feeling rather depressed.It was a satisfying read, and one I would surely recommend to all."
1009,Alison,"We already know I'm a sucker for unreliable, multiple, and awful narrators, so clearly this book was made with me in mind. But it's a really great work of suspense, with danger at every turn and terrible decisions being made and that sense of never knowing which way is up in the narrative. And for all that the narrators are terrible people, I really wanted things to work out for all of them.read more..."
1010, Sarah  ,"Omg I finally finished it, this was twisters. I can see how it's compared to ( gone girl). It took months to finish it because I was never in mood to be disturbed by the characters. Not one character appealed to me throughout the book, so it was hard to make myself read. But I get all the hype, this is a good thriller, well written and utterly surprising. I'm glad I made myself finish it. "
1011,Louise,"good, not amazing"
1012,Kathy ,"I approach reading a book such as The Girl on the Train with all the hype surrounding it in a state of both excitement and trepidation. With promises that it’s going to be one of the year's best books, I read the book with this expectation hovering over me. I really wanted to love it, to be able to proclaim my agreement with the horn tooters and prophets. It was interesting to see if I would fall in with those who proclaim its genius or those who failed to be smitten. This one had me lingering in the land of suspended opinion for pretty much the first half of the book. I genuinely disliked all the characters and found the three major women narrators either weak or bitchy. However, there is one measure of a novel’s effectiveness that cannot be denied. Did I need to keep reading to see what happens? Did I stay up late reading to fulfill that need as quickly as possible? The answers to both questions are “yes,” so I have to conclude that the story is a compelling one, and the deeply flawed characters are paramount to the success of the plot. The whole crazy setup works, and the characters do evolve. Of course, the fact that I have a fascination with trains and a long standing curiosity about what is going on in houses that I pass either on a train or car enhanced the method in which the story unfolds. My voyeurism was born watching Rear Window, where watching the daily routines of neighbors proved chillingly exciting and deadly. Not surprisingly, Hawkins’ book has been described as having Hitchcockian flair.Rachel Watson is about as sad a sack as can be, and the only real interest she has in life is watching the lives of others out of the train window as she travels from a small suburb of London into the city itself. Alcoholism and obsession are the constants of her life, and moving on from a devastating divorce seems an elusive step for her. As a distraction from her pain and decline, Rachel has become fixated on one couple in particular during her daily commute and has named them Jason and Jess, the perfect couple. The train’s signal stop enables Rachel to witness Jason and Jess having coffee on their back terrace in the mornings, and she becomes emotionally invested in the scene playing out before her. And, then Rachel's image of her perfect couple gets slammed by reality, as interactions Rachael witnesses in her train watching spill over into a drama of a missing woman. The often incoherent state of black out in which Rachel finds herself proves to land her right in the middle of this suburban drama as she strives to remember vital information. The police consider her an unreliable witness when she reports on what she’s seen from her couple watching. As Rachel desperately searches for answers, the lines between lies and truth blur, and the tension of the story winds tighter and tighter.Paula Hawkins uses three alternating narrators, three women at the heart of the story, with Rachel's voice being the prominent one. This approach allows the reader to understand how very little is as it seems. It works toward the climax of the different perspectives coming together in a chilling reveal. I started out stating that I didn't like the characters, meaning I wouldn't pick them as people to be in my life, but it doesn't mean that the characters didn't do their job well. While it won't be my favorite book of the year and isn't an ""it"" book for me, it was a good read that hit on my ""Rear Window"" sense of thrill. "
1013,Joana Almeida,"não é o fenómeno que fazem dele, mas é uma boa leitura :) "
1014,Sdare,"This book sucked me in and I couldn't put it down. I wanted to know what was going to happen! I had some assumptions in the beginning that proved to be correct, but I wasn't disappointed. I read it in two days! Our book club is going to have a lot to talk about tonight. "
1015,Becca,"So good! Really creepy, but the twists are well done. "
1016,Jamie Bradway,"It's a shade or two too complicated to be the basis for a Lifetime Movie, but I couldn't help thinking this is how things actually would go down if a real-life amateur 'sleuth' got involved in a mystery. Think Nancy Drew as a blackout drunk divorcee with no skills to recommend her the job but a stalker's gift for obsession and rationalization. It's not as funny as you might expect given those parameters. Or at all. But I enjoyed it."
1017,Monica,Sucked me right in! Took it everywhere I went and read in between every free moment. I love a good thriller!! 
1018,Hanley5545 Hanley,"This book was a better than most in that there are three different female protagonists each of which overlaps in time/place and interlinked roles and there is a clear and (most all of the time) suspenseful weaving of preception, recall and/or confused remembrance of ""what? and why? who donnit! didit!!""The prespective and perception is indeed that of a modern ""rashomon effect"" with homage to the quite original version....see also (if you are unfamiliar with the truly classic Japaneese tale) this link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashomo...What is not as well known is that Robert Browning wrote a very captivating long dramatic ""verse-novel/poem"" that is a strong complex renaissance intrigue worth a reference:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rin...This murder is truly most foul but the meandering recounting of crime,motive and suspects by the three voices as both parts of the events and its witness(es) is both creatively and powerfully concocted and revealed.We listened to the story on audio tape so each of the three overlapping internal monologues was read/acted by a completely different female actor. Really contributed to the telling of the tale.It really worked and kept our attention throughout....NO SPoilers here!!!..."
1019,Andrew Smith,"There are many excellent reviews of this book on Goodreads so I’m going to forgo any attempt to summarise the plot of this best selling thriller. Suffice to say, it tracks a series of events through the eyes of three women, whose lives interlink with tragic consequences. Cleverly, and very effectively, the tale is told through the ever-switching view of each of the three women. This variation in perspective created a level of tension that didn’t let up – well, not until the drawn-out final section of the book, which is probably its least satisfying element. We are introduced to normal (even enviable) people leading conventional, satisfying lives. Except, it gradually becomes apparent that their lives are actually unsettled, complex and somewhat claustrophobic. The people we accepted as happy and normal to start with begin to look troubled and manipulative as they succumb to an environment filled with lies and mistrust. This transition is executed very well, with subtle hints growing into certainty through the introduction, at first, of small details that create doubt and suspicion in the eyes of the reader. It’s great fun and very voyeuristic!As has been widely reported, the book has clear echo’s of  Gone Girl but I think it also has elements of the old Hitchcock film Rear Window. I liked the Englishness of it, a contrast to my predominant diet of American literature. And the tale was intriguing, with a mood that, if I had to compare it with anything, reminded me of the BBC series Broadchurch - no shame in that! Overall I found it to be an ingenious and well-written piece, just slightly let down by its protracted climax. "
1020,Piyali,"A suspenseful thriller. Very well written. It did remind me of Gone Girl, except the author allowed us to empathize with most of her characters. In Gone girl one simply abhorred the characters because of their sheer evilness. I am not much into thrillers but I really enjoyed reading this. The characters are very well developed. "

«One for sorrow, two for joy, three for a girl, four for a boy, five for silver, six for gold, seven for a secret never to be told.I’ve got a few of those.»
What is it about lies and schemes that excites us so much? Is our kind really so masochistic that we'd rather live in a lie rather than give it up and move on for something real? Are we really so blind that we can't see one feet in front of us? Can we really not see the lie sparkling in their eye? Or are we just pretending that we do not see so that the delusion can keep working out just fine and at the same time hoping that the lie goes away? Books like this, they change the way I see people. I feel like I'm always so trusty and quick-to-judge someone before I've witnessed all of their sides and I really want to stop being that person who will always be trying to find the good in every single person in my life, even those of small importance to me. Well, this kind of books, books like this and Gone Girl which I'm sure most of you have read, they change my perspective towards what I see and how I see it. We've all witnessed someone passing by and think ""wow, this one seems like a real good person"" or see a couple and say ""they're cute, they'll be together forever"". And what you don't know is that maybe this real good person you saw might have been a drug dealer, and maybe that cute couple you saw on the road, maybe the one is abusing the other or contemplating ways to bash in their head while lying asleep in the bed. Don't let appearances deceive you. Do not trust easily. Rachel is a drunk. No shit. She's drunk most of the time. Every day she wakes up, pretends that she goes to work, says so to her flatmate because she hasn't told her that she was fired because of her excessive drinking, takes the 8:04 train and goes to her ex-husband's house where he lives with his wife and their child. The child she was never able to give to him. She's one of those people, I'm sure you've seen them, you may be one of them too, that they look at everything, scrutinizing you from top to bottom. She's even noticed a couple, just 4-5 houses down the house she and her husband used to live, and she's created those fictional names for them and she imagines how they're living a wonderful life, full of roses and romance and candlelit dinners at nights. Until one morning she sees that woman kissing another man on the mouth. Her dream for the perfect couple being in existence got shattered.The woman, the one Rachel was fantasizing that she and her husband were leading the perfect life, well, she goes missing, the same day she saw her kissing that other man. The thing is, next morning she wakes up and while she can feel something is unmistakably wrong, she can't put her finger on it. She was drunk and she had a blackout, she's sure of it. But what happened between those moments of the blackout? What did she witness? The thing about this book is that it's gripping and it's twisty and has many fucked-up characters, my favorite kind, I love my characters fucked-up with tons of issues and why not drinking problems? I did not want to put this book down. Mrs. Hawkins knows how to tell a story. Creepy and fucking twisted, at that. But still a great story with plot twists and tons of suspense and angst going on in its entirety.I'm recommending this to anyone who loves a good thriller. And certainly to those who enjoyed Gone Girl.
One for sorrow, two for joy, three for a girl . . . Three for a girl. I’m stuck on three, I just can’t get any further. My head is thick with sounds, my mouth thick with blood. Three for a girl. I can hear the magpies—they’re laughing, mocking me, a raucous cackling. A tiding. Bad tidings. I can see them now, black against the sun. Not the birds, something else. Someone’s coming. Someone is speaking to me. Now look. Now look what you made me do.»

1022,Jeff Roush,"I love reading this book and not knowing what or whom I can trust or rely upon. I enjoy flawed characters, and this book contains nothing but. The characters are fairly flat, but I think that is a product of the book being told entirely through limited perspectives; it makes sense, given the structure, for readers to need to round the characters out ourselves. The book also moves very quickly for one that winds into such dark places in these flawed minds.I did feel like the ending came too abruptly, or perhaps with a little too much clarity regarding the big mystery and problem of the novel. That said, I appreciated the sense of life going on without suddenly becoming better after the climax.Overall, the book is a good read, and I enjoyed it immensely. If you want a protagonist (or indeed any character) you completely like or admire, or if you want a feel-good story, this is not the book for you. If you want to think through the story and explore some dark and sometimes depressing parts of human nature, I highly recommend it."
1023,Jenni Kennedy,This book was suspenseful and kept me reading until the end. Worth reading!
1024,Sharon Smith,"A lot of people have compared this book to Gone Girl. I will have to say I did not like Gone Girl but I did like this book. It was intriguing and did have the feel of complication Gone Girl had in the crime but while Gone Girl did not have a single redeemable character this novel has characters who are flawed but they have some redeeming qualities as well. This was a much cleaner, and more intriguing story on my opinion. It was a quick read, it held my interest and I enjoyed the writing style. Definitely one I would recommend."
1025,Alex,"Very comparable to ""Gone Girl."" Strong female lead characters, intertwining stories, and extremely suspenseful up until the very last pages. Highly recommend for anyone who binges on thriller novels and likes dark plots."
1026,Vladimir,"Por Dios, no sé ni por dónde empezar! Será por aclarar que es un 4.5Este libro me encantó a pesar de que por rato la protagonista me parecía patética (y con poca dignidad). Como se fue desarrollando la trama, como fue Rachel contando su historia desde el punto B al Y, y dándonos los flashbacks y experiencias del punto A (como empezó todo). Me mantuvo pegado a él, desde que pasó lo que pasó, y aunque ya empezaba a sospechar, no fue nada comparado con lo que ocurrió en realidad más bien a como se desarrolló el enfrentamiento final. Mientras tenía mi pausa en el trabajo estaba leyendo y llevaba poco más de la mitad, no quería parar, pero debía. Al llegar a casa, me he puesto con él y según, mñna lo terminaba pero no he podido soltarlo más hasta el final. Al final la chica de tren, ha sido de las grandes lecturas que he hecho este 2015 respecto a este género. "
1027,Karla Fernández,"miles de cosas que hacer y no pude parar de leer. me encantan los personajes desquiciados y este libro tenía de sobra.Rachel, Megan y Anna. Las tres narradoras del libro tienen su personalidad, distinta la una de la otra y se va conformando la historia. Ellas llevan el peso de la trama y lo hacen de una manera muy genialRachel: divorciada de Tom. Alcohólica. Viaja todos los días en el tren de las 08:04 y pasa por lo que era su ex vecindario por lo que siempre está atenta al pasar por ahí.Megan: Casada. Desempleada. Tiene problemas con su pasado y no sabe lidiar con ellos. Vive en el ex vecindario de Rachel.Anna: Nueva esposa de Tom ( fue su amante cuando estaba casado con Rachel) . Tiene una hija con este. Odia a Rachel. Desempleada. Entre estas tres mujeres se va conformando la trama y vemos qué va pasando entre ellas y cómo se desarrolla esta historia, a partir de la desaparición de una de ellas. El libro es muy rápido de leer, no podía parar."
1028,Swapnil Bokade,"This is the debut novel of Paula Hawkins who has turned over to writing thrillers after 25 years of journalism. It's a classic whodunnit story made interesting by unreliable narrators. The plot is as follows, the main narrator Rachel takes the same train for her daily commute to town. Everyday as the train stops at a particular signal,Rachel peeps into the houses and the lives of the people that live across the track. She becomes obsessed with the life of inhabitants of one such house,number 15. The couple whom she has named Jess and Jason seem to be in love and lead a perfect life from her vantage point and she wishes for her own life to be just like that. Trouble starts once when she sees Jess kissing someone other than Jason from the train. Rachel whose past life is fraught with issues decides to confront Jess or Jason. Later Jess disappears and Rachel gets entangled in the mess. Rachel is an alcoholic and there are huge gaps in her recollection of events which adds up the mystery content of the story. Since the cast is small, after the disappearance it's pretty easy to figure out who the culprit can be and then you are just waiting for the big reveal. You are only interested in the how of it and not the who since once you eliminate the red herrings there is only one character left who could possibly do it. That's the only reason I thought parts of the book dragged a bit but overall it's a fun read."
1029,Sera,"This book played out well on audio for me.I wish that book critics and marketers would stop comparing every thriller to Gone Girl. It's not really fair to the authors in this genre who are trying to tell their own stories in their own ways.In Hawkins' debut novel, Hawkins weaves a tale about a lonely, jealous alcoholic woman and two happily married couples, when, oh, oh - one of the 3 women in this circle goes missing. How the lives of all 3 women intersect and what it means to the ""who done it"" tale provided a pretty good romp for me on audio. I like that Hawkins tried to go different places with her storytelling, and I appreciated her pursuit of standing apart from many other books in this genre. I think that she was successful, which isn't easy to do, especially because of Gone Girl, but Hawkins does a nice job, especially with what I found to be a very satisfying ending.Overall, I recommend this book."
1030,GinaRose Cristello,"The story here actually read like a train! Started out purposefully chugging along, caught my attention right away, and then built faster and faster. Enjoyed the story, I found the concept really unique and it was definitely a compelling thriller! 4 stars because I did not find it as unpredictable as I think was intended.. certainly still enjoyed the story but I had an idea where it was headed!"
1031,Kelsey Shivers,"Despite the fact that I absolutely could not stand the narrator, this plot really kept me hooked and quickly turning the pages. The last 100 pages were by far the best part."
1032,Dale White,"""A debut psychological thriller that will forever change the way you look at other people's lives.""Well not quite, but that was part of the reason I liked The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins. The story is told through the eyes of three women. Rachel (the girl on the train) is a messed up drunk who can't let go of Tom, her cheating ex-husband who dumped her for another woman. Anna is the other woman, now a mother, who has moved into Tom's home which Rachel repeatedly visits and phones in hopes of getting Tom back. And Megan is the woman down the street who is having an affair of her own.Every day, Rachel rides the train from her new home to London and each day the train stops within sight of her old home and Megan's. Rachel fantasizes about Megan and her husband and the happy life they must live until one day she witnesses Megan kissing another man. Shortly after Megan goes missing. Rachel, unreliable, drunken Rachel involves herself in the case and tries to sort out fleeting memories of drunken episodes that may have some bearing on the case. That is the thriller part.But for me the best part was all the inter-relations that add to the mystery: Tom and Rachel. Anna and Rachel. Megan and her therapist among others.This isn't great literature but if you are looking for something to amuse and pass the time, you can't go wrong with this one. "
1033,natalie,Finished in an afternoon Couldn't stop reading once I started. I finished the book in one day and it was great. For the first time in a long time in was surprised by the ending of a book!! 
1034,Aparna B.,"Really it's more a 3.5/5: Throughout most of the book, I'd say about 3/4 of the way, I was prepared to give this 4 and even 4.5/5 stars. However, once the book climaxed, it was kind of predictable. It still had some very good twists and turns, don't get wrong! I was definitely captivated by the writing, the character development and it was so vivid I could picture everything perfectly as it played out. I felt like a voyeur while reading - like something out of a Hitchcock movie a la Rear Window. I felt ashamed and crazy for defending and siding with some of the characters who were just a crazy mess. I loved and hated the characters, which I think is part of the appeal. So overall, this was a great read and I'm very glad I read it! I definitely recommend it."
1035,Tairu,"Te pone en una sola angustia desde el principio y te mantiene alterada casi todo el libro, en mi caso desee que todos murieran."
1036,Frannie Cheska ,"wow! talk About a wild ride! 3.5 4 stars for me. The story began a little slow for me but I kept going because i knew there was a thrill somewhere. It kept me guessing the entire time about all of the characters and I couldnt figure out who did it so when it happened i was def surprised BUT i dont feel like it flowed well. The shock of who the guilty was seriously came out of no where and I cant figure out if i liked it or not. It really didnt fit that character at all, at least not the way the author wrote it. Also, I felt terrible for the main character, her story is so sad. But that's just it, she's a sad character. By the end of the book, I was more annoyed with her than sad for her. Pitty turned into annoyance as she just happened to remember what she had seen. Not just that but technically she didnt see anything so i didnt feel she was important to the case aside from the fact that she was desperate for... i dont want to say attention but desperate for something. there were so many loose ends here, so many! like: what happened to the therapist? did the fact that she saw him help her in any way? So was her husband like that the entire time they were together? what is real and what was made up by him? what happened to scott? he was so important to the book then he just fell off? what was the point of the encounter with the red haired man on the train? the fact that rachel is an alcoholic really made me feel for the girl but at the same time i couldnt tell in the end what was what. who was the missing with when she said 'this is the last time' the therapist or the husband? see what i mean? so many questions that didnt lead to the end but didnt give me any closure. over all it was a 4 star because it kept my attention through the whole thing and a week later here i am still thinking about it. "
1037,Henz,I have mixed feelings about this book. Reading from an unreliable narrator can be thrilling as well as annoying because you really want to get to the bottom of things but you can't even trust what she's saying and it's frustrating at times but you also find yourself sympathizing for being the way she is. This is all about Psychology people and I pat myself on the back for getting the right character to blame for the mysterious death. 
1038,Bri,"I give this book 3.5/5 stars. This book was an extremely quick read and was very easy to jump back into after putting it down, no matter what's going on around you aka this is a good book to read on a train! It was a decent thriller that I didn't figure out until right before the big reveal... but I also wasn't super curious to find out what the big reveal actually was. Was the book engaging while it was in my hands? Yes. Was it dominating my thoughts whenever I wasn't reading it as I want mysteries to do? No. Will I remember the details of this book two months from now? Probably not. I've never seen a title on GoodReads be reviewed by so many of my friends, aside from the Harry Potter series maybe, so obviously there's something in this book that captivates a large number of people (side note: this article detailing the book's wild success on GoodReads is worth a read of its own). I bumped it up on my To-Read list because of a strong-sell from a friend and because a promo photo of Emily Blunt starring in the film version was released. This book will be talked about a lot so I'm happy to have read it so I can participate in discussions with peers, but overall, I kind of wish this girl (me) had picked a different book to read on the train. "
1039,Beccy Fike,"An exceptional first novel that I truly could not put down! Yes, there are legitimate comparisons to Rear Window and Gone Girl but this story stands on its own as a very entertaining read. I look forward to more by Paula Hawkins. "
1040,Bre,Whoa damn. This was good. The last 1/3 of the novel was pretty intense. It's been a while since I've read a book like this - a female-centric thriller. I would definitely recommend it.
1041,Ali (alireadsbooks),"So first of all, I think it’s worth noting that I read this book in one day. Well, I read the first 40 pages on Saturday night and the rest throughout Sunday. So basically one day. In other words, either it was really good or I just really didn’t want to do my homework. Maybe a little bit of both.I’ve been hearing about this book all over the place – it’s topping bestselling lists everywhere, it’s being called “the next Gone Girl”, and my mom read it within a couple days and told me I would like it. So finally, after I’d just finished a hefty 500+ page epic fantasy the day before, I thought I’d give The Girl on the Train a shot.To give you a short synopsis in case you’re not already familiar, The Girl on the Train follows three women, Rachel, Megan, and Anna, who are brought together (although not always consciously) by ex-husbands, commuter trains into London, and illegal activity. The timeline jumps between present and past as the three women’s stories intertwine and a mystery unravels. That’s really all I want to say without giving anything away; I would recommend going into this book without knowing much more.I’ve heard a lot of people say they were disappointed because they went in expecting the next Gone Girl and got something completely different. However, I think it’s important to recognize that no book is really “the next” anything. Unless you count Fifty Shades of Grey, which was based off of Twilight fanfiction and was therefore pretty accurately “the next Twilight” upon its release. Basically, what I’m trying to say is that The Girl on the Train was completely different from Gone Girl or any other psychological thriller I’ve read, but I totally get why the two are being compared. The Girl on the Train deals with rocky marriages, unreliable narrators, and apparent mental illness in a way that so far I’ve only seen matched in Gillian Flynn’s work.The characters, in this case, were more believable for me than those in Gone Girl (and I promise I’ll stop comparing this to Gone Girl now). All five of the central characters arguably suffer from some sort of mental illness, and I think Hawkins grasps this in such an authentic way. When a character was anxious or manic, I felt my pulse race and my reading speed up. When a character was depressed, the reading got slower and I found myself inwardly channeling written emotions. Also, the way Hawkins wrote the thoughts of a character suffering from alcohol addiction felt so incredibly real to me, despite never having suffered from addiction, myself. None of the characters were particularly likeable; they all had their inner demons, but I found myself relating to them all at one point or another.This book doesn’t have a particularly dense plot; sometimes I would read 40 or 50 pages and discover that nothing of value had really happened. While this would normally frustrate me, I found that it really didn’t in this case. Even though actual things weren’t taking place, the characters’ inner dialogues and stress over uncovering the truth kept me intrigued throughout.I really need to mention the setting of this novel, because it felt so incredibly real. This might be because I spent three months living in London and could therefore picture exactly what a community on the city’s outskirts would look like. I could also relate to Rachel’s obsession with “Jason and Jess” during her morning and evening commutes because I often found myself picking out the same houses again and again during the over ground legs of my journeys. I actually got chills once in a while when I would recognize the names of train stations or supermarkets. Also, I kept getting pretty strong Broadchurch vibes, for obvious reasons if you’re familiar with the show.Basically, this was just a really cool book. Not very literary, but definitely thought provoking. It puts you inside the minds of people you may not normally associate with and make them seem more human than they might have otherwise.Needless to say, while this book is not Gone Girl, if you’re a fan of Gillian Flynn or simply of psychological thrillers, I would definitely recommend this.(This review was originally posted on my blog at https://alireadsbooks.wordpress.com/2...)"
1042,Sandy Nawrot,"So this is the IT book everyone is talking about. If you looked at the NYT bestseller list, you would maybe expect something mind-blowing and ""Gone Girl-esque"". (By the way, GG is doomed to be the generic term for anything twisty. Just like every Scandinavian thriller had The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo in its blurb. Please.) But Gone Girl it isn't. What it IS is a fast-paced, entertaining debut novel that hit the right buttons at the right time. It is written in a slightly sneaky way that is suspenseful and a tad twisty. Most of the characters are pathetic, awful creatures that are hard to like and hard to stomach for 336 pages. I mean, the protagonist is an overweight alcoholic that is so lonely she inserts herself into the lives of people she has seen from the train into and out of London. By the end of the book, I suppose I had a small amount of sympathy for her. The book excels in this way...characters that are larger than life. The story is not exceptionally smart or clever, but that is OK. It is a fun ride, and should make for a good discussion at book club.It has been optioned for a movie already, to be developed by Marc Platt (Drive, Into the Woods). I'm curious about how this will turn out, simply because the edge, or the hook if you will, is how much of the narrative is shadowed from specifics, and leaves the reader to fumble around in the dark trying to determine who is to be trusted and who is doing what.I would definitely recommend this one, just keep your expectations in check. "
1043,beautywithbooks,"Trilling, compulsive and gripping. The story revolves around three women. Rachel, Anna and Megan.Rachel, an alcoholic depressed soul, after her break up with her husband Tom. Anna, the young woman whom Tom choose over Rachel. Megan, who always cheated and ran away from her life rather then facing them. Whom will you trust or like. None of them are perfect. All in a complete mess.Rachel lost her husband and job too. But still catches the 8.04 slow train from Ashbury to Euston pretending to go to office. The trains stops at the same signal, overlooking a row of back gardens. There she always see a couple sitting at the patio or the makeshift terrace. She makes her imaginary story of those couple: Jess and Jason, as they are perfect. They are beautiful, happy and peaceful together. They are the perfect couple. All that she is not.But on one of the Fridays, her perfect couple image of Jess and Jason breaks. She could not take it. She is so disturbed. And the very next night Jess is missing. Now she cannot be just a girl on the train. She wants to help Jason. When she takes the decision, she comes to face the bitter reality.Anna, who is suspicious about her husband. She has the feeling that her husband Tom still has clandestine relation with his ex, Rachel. She starts checking Tom's mails in his absence to find a proof. She wants to be happy with her family with Tom and her daughter Evie. With Rachel gone for ever from their lives.Megan, the beautiful, pretty women of Rachel's imaginary story: Jess. She has secrets to keep. She is restless. With her art gallery gone, there is nothing much for her to keep her busy. She wants a purpose in life. She is looking for distractions. She always runs away from her situations. She decides for once to make her life right. To do every thing that is right. And what fate does she meets for being straight and true and right?"
1044,Gökçe,"Mükemmel ! Polisiye okumayı gerçekten çok seviyorum. Okurken o hissettiğim gerginlik, bir şeyleri çözmek için kafa yormam... Bu kitap bana bu duyguları yaşattı. Karakterler ve kurgu çok iyiydi. Tek sıkıntı katil olayının biraz kısa tutulmuş olması. Ben o bölümde daha çok gerilim, daha çok tartışma bekliyordum."
1045,Denice Williams,I really couldn't figure it out until the end... And love that!
1046,Jen Ryan,"I can't remember the last time I read an entire book in a day. This was tasty brain candy, even if I guessed the culprit pretty early on. And I enjoyed that the protagonist wasn't some gorgeous, brilliant model type, but a deeply flawed and somewhat unreliable person."
1047,Bibi Larson,A good thriller. It does not pay to cheat on your spouse - fatal attraction vs gone girl. Crazy killer spouse!!
1048,Wendy Rolling,"I read this in the RV on an impromptu road trip with my parents.I think this was an overall good thriller. It's one of those rare different P.O.V novels that actually is well put together and used effectively to give the reader limited information, therefore giving off that mysterious vibe. Granted I haven't read many different P.O.V novels, but from what I know I think Hawkins did a pretty good job juggling with the characters.The characters were well written, well written as in unreliable and untrustworthy but hey whatever makes a story more interesting. I felt myself sympathizing with the lead but also getting frustrated with her continuous addictive behaviours, but this goes to show how well Hawkins has portrayed the reality of being an alcoholic. There was no sugar coating in her actions and how there was always going to be harsh consequences for it. One thing that threw me off was definitely (view spoiler)[ the plot twist. I mean near the end I was able to piece it together because Dr. Kamal and Scott would have been too obvious as the killer. I guess it was the lack of Anna's P.O.V in earlier parts of the book so that we couldn't see more of Tom's normal behaviours, or lack thereof. I mean Tom cheated for crying out loud, that should've been the biggest red flag that he's a deceiving son of a b*tch but I was pulled into Rachel's self pity that I was blinded from it as well. (hide spoiler)]Looking for a light/medium read and a good thriller? This is the one, you'll be turning the pages so fast.Anyone has some recommendations that are similar to this book? Maybe not similar but some good thrillers/mysteries novels in general.p.s. idk where all the hate comes from tbh. If you genuinely disliked it just talk about what and why you didn't like it, but don't start acting pretentious and put people down for enjoying a book that someone has put effort into writing. Many people gave it 4-5 stars for a reason, it means they liked it and found it interesting. And if you found problems with the characters then that means Hawkins did a good job at portraying realistic versions of people in the world. ya'll must be so fun at parties, going on and on about how much you hate a book, ""OMG DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. IT SUCKS SO BAD. LIKE IDK WHAT THE AUTHOR WAS THINKING WHEN THEY WROTE THIS. SUCH A WASTE OF MY TIME. I WANT TO KILL MYSELFQKOTJNWIGKA$YWRLEHM"" "
1049,Lizz Sayers,"I enjoyed this book for its ability to suck you into the story from the very beginning and keep you guessing to the very end.I enjoy books with an unreliable narrator and compared to Gone Girl which I found really juvenile and the twist easy to pick early on, this book was a lot more sophisticated in its execution.It's a fun read when you're in the mood for something less taxing on the brain than the most recent literary prize winner's new novel.3 and a half stars."
1050,Kimberly Kutnick,"I gave this a 4 because it was a captivating, quick read. I like fast books that make me want more and more and more. That being said I felt like I was alongside Rachel most of the time trying to figure it all out. And, about 75% of the way I did figure out that it was Tom. I was both happy and not happy. Because I figured it out and really wanted a zinger in the end. I do have questions-Was Megan never sleeping with the shrink and that was Tom? If so, the author did a good job confusing the reader. Or, did she have an affair with both?I had a hard time figuring out Anna. I really didn't like her. I always rooted for Rachel. And, Megan was 50 shades of messed up.But, I guess my favorite thing was that you really can't judge a book by its cover. Rachel sees Megan as a perfect person while on the train. But, we all know that what you see isn't always a reality. So, I thought that was fantastic.Additionally, I thought that Rachel had so, so, so many issues....but it was good to know that she wasn't mean or nasty. She just had been screwed by Tom.........I kind of want to re-read the end because I just read it last night!"
1051,Fil,"SFIDA TRA ROMANZI VINCITORIQuesto veloce romanzo è molto realistico e piacevole, però non posso negare che mi abbia in parte deluso. L'ho acquistato quando era primo in classifica e tutti lo elogiavano. Mi ero creato aspettative troppo alte. Nonostante la vittoria su goodreads come miglior thriller del 2015, non è stato il ""MIO thriller dell'anno"". Per me lo è stato  Gone girl, vincitore dello stesso premio nel 2012. La ragazza del treno appartiene al genere thriller psicologico, che sembra essere diventato una moda.  La regina dei castelli di carta,  Il senso di Smilla per la neve,  Gone Girl. L'elenco potrebbe diventare molto lungo. Lo stile, sicuramente fluido e veloce, mi sembra in ritardo. La doppia narrazione, che per quasi tutto il libro alterna il racconto della protagonista Rachel a quello di Megan, sarebbe stata molto originale qualche anno fa. Se vi piace potete ritrovarla ad esempio in  Qualcuno con cui correre,  1q84,  Gone Girl.Dopo aver nominato per ben tre volte  Gone Girl, è inevitabile il confronto. Entrambi sono thriller psicologici, entrambi scritti con la doppia narrazione, entrambi in prima persona. Io ho preferito Gone Girl per lo stile ironico, la sua originalità ed il finale a sorpresa. Molti preferiranno questo thriller per il maggior realismo.Un pregio del vincitore 2015 è senza dubbio il realismo. I personaggi sono totalmente realistici, però, nel mio specifico caso, non sono riusciti a trasmettermi molto simpatia. I personaggi dei thriller di  Micheal Connelly sono realistici al cento per cento e riescono a coinvolgermi. I personaggi di  Paula Hawkins non mi hanno emozionato, ma è solo questione di gusti.Il realismo della trama e' un altro punto di forza. Alcuni scrittori di thriller sacrificano il realismo per fare trame più avvincenti e personaggi più simpatici. Non  Paula Hawkins. È impossibile trovare un solo punto poco realistico nella trama.I temi sono molto attuali. La disoccupazione e l'alcolismo sono tematiche importanti, ma ad essere sincero non mi hanno coinvolto molto. Penso sia dovuto ai personaggi per cui non provavo grande trasporto. Se qualche lettore si innamorerà di Rachel, sicuramente verrà coinvolto da queste importanti tematiche.Riprendendo il paragone con  Gone Girl (entrambi hanno il matrimonio fra i loro temi principali), evidenzio una differenza. Le tematiche di Gone Girl sono quasi esclusivamente di natura psicologica, in questo thriller si mescolano invece temi psicologici a temi sociali. L'intreccio de  La ragazza del treno non è troppo complicato. Ho indovinato il colpevole prima del finale. Non mi succede molto spesso. Bisogna sottolineare che nei gialli classici sono presenti molti più personaggi e sono tutti poco profondi. Nei thriller, al contrario, i personaggi sono in numero minore e sono descritti con molta più cura. Agatha Christie sembra volerti ingannare, Paula Hawkins sembra invece voler darti una mano. Non che sia scontato indovinare il finale (ho prestato il libro a due amici e nessuno aveva previsto il colpo di scena finale), diciamo che sono stato particolarmente fortunato. O sfortunato? Forse preferisco le volte in cui sbaglio e l'autore riesce a sorprendermi. Per esempio, il finale di  Gone Girl mi ha sorpreso. Secondo me chi non indovinera' l'identità del colpevole apprezzerà maggiormente questo ""giallo"". A differenza di Gone Girl, consiglio questo thriller anche agli amanti del genere giallo.In conclusione, non definirei ""La ragazza del treno"" un capolavoro, ma un ottimo thriller, molto realistico, attuale e scorrevole. Voto 3,5. Sicuramente un'ottima lettura estiva. "
1052, ✧*:∙ debz ✧*:∙,"Premetto dicendo che questa èla prima volta che leggo un giallo e devo dire che le mie aspettative non sono state deluse, anzi, sono stata invogliata a leggere altri libri di questo genere.Parlando ora del libro, è completamente diverso da quello che mi aspettavo.La lettura mi ha preso molto e sono riuscita a finirlo in due giorni scarsi. (Leggevo anche durante il tragitto in metro, giusto per dire che di solito non leggo sui mezzi pubblici).Non voglio fare spoilers e nient'altro, tuttavia ci tenevo a dire la mia.Ho visto pareri contrastanti su questo libro, di persone che hanno amato la storia e persone che invece non sono state soddisfatte pienamente, se non per nulla, dalle aspettative che si sono create.Il libro ha avuto molto successo se teniamo conto di tutte le copie che ha venduto (tuttavia questo non significa che sia un capolavoro, molte volte il successo deriva da una buona pubblicità, passaparola e sicuramente la capacità dell'autore di saper catturare un possibile lettore con una trama intrigante e non comune).Non avendo letto altri gialli mi risulta difficile fare confronti con altri libri riguardanti questo genere.Per quanto la storia possa essermi piaciuta, tuttavia non riesco a non pensare che una parte di me ha trovato alcune cose un po' banali. Nel senso che, senza rilevare troppo, il colpevole è facilmente individuabile già da una buona metà del libro, mentre io mi aspettavo di capirlo verso la fine. (Ripeto, forse sono io che ho poca dimestichezza con i gialli).I personaggi hanno tutti un profilo interessante e intrigante, così tanto che a un certo punto ho iniziato a sospettare che il colpevole potesse essere qualunque tra di loro.Consiglio il libro a chi non ha mai letto gialli ma ne potrebbe essere interessato. È stata una buona lettura e non mi pento assolutamente di averla intrapresa."
1053,Lonni,This is a book about a woman who is an alcoholic who rides the train daily. She makes up stories about the people she sees in their homes from the train and then one day is confronted with the fact that she is entwined in their lives/problems. I listened to this book and it was really well performed. It was like listening to a movie! 
1054,Collette,"I wish that I had picked to read this one instead of listen to it. (However, the three women reading it did a great job) I love books filled with suspense, no matter if the answers seem a little obvious or are totally a shock. I love that this book got into the brains and thought processes of Rachel, Megan and Anna. You rarely ever know why people do what they do in real life, but in books it can be shown so well. Anyway, I don't want to say anything about the plot, but I enjoyed it, was a bit on my seat and didn't want to stop listening.EDIT - I felt unsatisfied with my initial review. I felt like this was a cross/blend of Gone Girl and The Husband's Secret and maybe not as good as either, but maybe I just feel like that because it was not the first book I've read recently like this. I think sometimes suspenseful books can seen already done when you read enough of them and find too many similarities. However, I really liked that I just wanted to know what the truth was and wanted to get there now. That's why I gave it a 4 star. It doesn't have to be the best, it just has to either make me keep thinking, make me want to just keep reading (or listening in this case) without stopping, or just simply have fantastic content. This rating was based on the middle idea."
1055,Barbara,"I've been looking for a book that would blow me away with its writing and character development, and I finally found one that satisfied me even while it reminded me of an Alfred Hitchcock film with all of its twists and turns, rather appropriate given its title. While I can't say that I was completely surprised by the ending, I enjoyed the journey along the way and the way my trust in one character after another was eroded and then reaffirmed. The characters are complicated, nuanced, imperfect, and have the ability to surprise readers, and it's hard not to imagine what one might do if one were in a particular character's shoes. On the surface, the story seems to revolve around the mental state of Rachel Watson, an alcoholic divorced woman who clings to the slim hope that her ex-husband will return to her and whose drinking has caused her to lose her job. So that her housemate won't know the truth, she leaves home every day to ride a commuter train to work. Perhaps because her own life had ended in disappointment, she enjoys starring out the windows at the flats along the way and fantasizing about the couple she often spies from her window. When Megan, the woman she's been watching, disappears one day, Rachel is sure she has information that must be shared with the police. But she suffers from black outs during her drinking bouts, and she cannot remember exactly what she saw on the day of Megan's disappearance. The story would be interesting enough if it were told solely from Rachel's point of view, but because Anna Watson, the wife of Rachel's former husband Tom, offers her take on Rachel and the book's events, it becomes even more intriguing. Add to the mix the voice of Megan, the victim, whose story begins more than a year before Rachel's, and readers are constantly on guard to see when all the competing stories will come crashing together. The author does an excellent job of building some sympathy for all three women while also portraying them in an unadmirable light. Rachel, for instance, needs to stop wallowing in misery, cease drinking, and avoid putting herself in risky situations. Anna needs to find some kindness in her heart and empty it of the hatred and disdain she feels toward Rachel, and Megan needs to stop trying to seduce every male that crosses her path. But truthfully, all three have very good reasons for being the way they are, which still doesn't justify the way they are treated. A couple of other reviewers claimed to despise these three women while I felt sad for them. My disgust and mistrust were sent in another direction, though, and all I can conclude is that what goes around does come around. "
1056,Ella,"The ending is what redeemed this book, and probably because of the twist I didn't see coming. The rest of the book was quite slow, and rather frustrating - the characters were infuriating at times, particularly Rachel, for reasons I will not mention to avoid spoiler-tagging.But, I have to say, the suspense was built well. This book is a real page-turner - though I was desperate to discover the truth, and found the book to drag in portions, I was not put off. I still could not wait to pick it up and continue, I still kept reading.I did enjoy this, but I almost can not see where the hype stems from. Yes, it is a good thriller, and the twist was unexpected, but... is it not just a well-written thriller? Maybe I haven't read enough of this genre to judge, maybe I should read more crime/suspense/thriller novels before I make such an assumption, but to me, though extremely well and intelligently written, it did not seem to be anything particularly extraordinary.However, I do think that The Girl on the Train is a well-thought out and executed book, and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone. Though most of the book is slow, the ending is amazing. I was hooked.I am glad I read it."
1057,Kris Potratz,"A big thanks to my book club for picking The Girl on the Train. Fair warning dear readers, you are either going to really like this book or you are really not going to like this book, in scrolling through the other goodreads reviews, there is not a whole lot of in between on that one. While I understand the comparisons to ""Gone Girl"" Paula Hawkins definitely occupies a different space in the dark and twisty genre than does Gillian Flynn. Full review on http://paperpossebookblog.blogspot.co..."
1058,Krissadele,"Wow. That is all I can say. WowThis book definitely messed with my mind in the last 100 pages. This was my first psychological thriller and if this is any indication of what the genre will supply then boy do I wanna read more physiological thrillers. So much was going on and so much was hidden from the reader, reading I felt like I was in this twisting and turing roller coaster full of surprises. And oh goodness the ending of this book... so unexpected. I actually gasped when I read it.The characters were one of the many things I both appreciated and disliked. There are three point of views: Rachel, Meghan, and Anna. All of them are the flawed messed up characters that despite their mistakes I enjoyed the reality and honest truth of their situation and their reaction. I will admit I wasn't the hugest fan of Anna and Meghan but I appreciated that in their own ways their were raw. Also Rachel who is an alcoholic and is described as very messed up she was realistic to her situation and her actions were reasonable. These characters are all different and undergo many hardships I loved how they stay true to reality and what it offers to them. "
1059,Jorie Mark,Really fascinating symmetry between the three women and two men. As gripping as Gone Girl.
1060,Jo Baughan,Great read and kept me guessing. 
1061,Kevin L,"3.75 stars. As I read this I couldn't help but compare it with Gone Girl, somewhat unfavorably by being the secondly such book in this vein. Again we have unreliable narrators, but these characters are perhaps a bit more relatable than Gone Girls'.I enjoyed the intercutting narration, but the coyness of the author with broad pronouns at times becomes a bit annoying and telegraphs (unintentionally, I think) where the story is going. Worth your time, but not world changing."
1062,Traci Torrey,"I couldn't put this book down. I just needed to get to the end to figure it out. Great story, fast paced. But to call it ""the next gone girl"" isn't true. Fell a little short on that promise. Still worth the read though..even skipped the gym to finish it! "
1063,Jade Reed,"Just amazing!! My heart was literally pounding reading the last 50 pages...This book definitely kept me on the edge of my seat, so many twists and turns that I didn't see coming! I love how awful the characters are and how everyone has their own dark secrets."
1064,Haris,"Constantly compared to Gone Girl because it involves a woman and murder, The Girl On The Train is a very good thriller in its own right. Our main unreliable narrator, Rachel, is an unemployed alcoholic who takes the daily train to town to fool her roommate into thinking she's still working. On one daily stop she sees into the houses of her old neighborhood where her ex Tom now lives with his new wife and former mistress Anna (and their child), but Rachel forms an attachment to a couple down the street that she builds up in her mind as the perfect couple. The plot is set in motion when Rachel observes Megan (of the perfect couple) cheat on Scott. Shortly thereafter, Megan disappears, and Rachel, still drinking heavily and essentially stalking Tom, wakes up with bloodstains and no memory. The other women also get a turn narrating, with similarly unreliable accounts and some time-shifting.While the surface story is about what happened to Megan, the true mastery of the book is in the psychological insights it offers. The characters are, for the most part, between flawed and terrible. Rachel's growing despair that she tries to tame with alcohol, Anna's jealous paranoia, and ultimately Megan's loneliness; all of these are shown in subtle but powerful ways. Rachel, for example, explains what it's like be too drunk to remember an embarrassing incident (""You want to be able to remember it for yourself, to see it and experience it in your own memory, so that - how did you put it? - so that it belongs to you?"") and wants to ""scream with the frustration of it, the not knowing, the uselessness of my own brain."" (Ed.: Guilty.)The women also agree on one point: the pleasure of control they get from being attractive to a man: ""That's the thing I like most about it, having power over someone. That's the intoxicating thing."" ""I was enjoying myself too much. Being the other woman is a huge turn-on, there's no point denying it: you're the one he can't help but betray his wife for, even though he loves her. That's just how irresistible you are."" ""I never meant for it to go anywhere, I didn't want it to go anywhere. I just enjoyed feeling wanted; I liked the feeling of control.""It's an understandable temptation, and it's particularly interesting to see it framed from three very different women.Other highlights, sans context: ""Parents don't care about anything but their children. They are the centre of the universe; they are all that really counts. Nobody else is important, no one else's suffering or joy matters, none of it is real."" ""How much better life must have been for jealous drunks before emails and texts and mobile phones, before all this electronica and the traces it leaves.""Recommended. "
1065,Ange,"I really dig a good psychological thriller or suspense novel from time to time and this one hit the spot. The writing was fairly straightforward and simple, but alternated between three female narrators. We try to figure out how their stories are intertwined and what the significance of main character Rachel's observations as the ""girl on the train."" There is a fairly strong storyline and the realistic blurring of lines based on the perspective of a ""he said she said"" situation, along with patchy memories and alcoholic hazes creates just the right amount of confusion. Unreliable narrators keep the reader guessing just how all the puzzle pieces fit together up until the end. It's hard to trust or bond with this cast of characters and it's hard to know whom to trust. I'll be honest, the ending was a bit strange to me. But it proved fairly satisfying, so this book is one that has my recommendation if you can get past the fragmented accounts of each narrator."
1066,Marie Ohanesian Nardin,Not many books have kept me turning pages like this one did. 
1067,nurmawati,"Menarik mistery nyaPenceritaannya juga bagus, bikin kita gak sabar mo baca terusGak membosankanTapi jangan mengharapkan ada kisah cinta"
1068,Crystal Craig,"""On the train, the tears come, and I don't care if people are watching me; for all they know, my dog might have been run over. I might have been diagnosed with a terminal illness. I might be a barren, divorced, soon-to-be-homeless alcoholic.""The Girl on the Train is a complex mystery with enough suspense to make you keep reading. Now, the characters, on the other hand: Jeez Louise! What a train wreck-bunch of individuals. They're all rather flawed and disturbing; the women all suffer from various levels of depression. It's very hard to feel anything towards them besides contempt. Once I got to the end of the story, and everything revealed - why the women obsess the way they do, why they're such emotional basket cases - it all makes sense. But still, I couldn't relate to them simply because I'd never let a man have that much power over me. Readers who enjoy mystery suspense novels will eat this book up, so it's high rating on goodreads doesn't surprise me. If you can tolerate the unlikable cast, this book is a worth-while read. "
1069,Kim Steel,Better than Gone Girl!
1070,Katherine Laprade,"J'ai beaucoup aimé le rythme du livre et le développement désorganisé entre les différentes narrations. Le roman est un bel équilibre entre le mystère et le suspense tendu, parfois légèrement morbide . Les doutes de Rachel sur elle-même et sa perception de la réalité ajoute à la complexité de son point de vue. Le style est parfait pour rendre les états d'âmes des personnages et j'ai facilement été transporté quelques heures dans les vies entremêlées ces Londoniens"
1071,Jenna (lostwithinwords),"AHA!!! I guessed it right! Overall, I quite enjoyed this book, although it was filled with unlikable characters and some terrible things... Full review on my blog here <3"
1072,Julieschreiner,This was one twisted book. Not quite sure how I feel about it...
1073,Book Addict Shaun,"PR extraordinaire Alison Barrow knows exactly how to create a buzz surrounding the books she works with, no sooner does she reveal a book than the publishing and blogging worlds go crazy. That is exactly what happened when The Girl on the Train was revealed, with one of the best proof covers I've ever seen, sadly my review copy was digital! The praise coming in for it was almost all positive, therefore I went into it with much excitement, and high expectations. There was a battle to acquire the rights to the book, and after reading it it's easy to see why.I really loved the idea for The Girl on the Train. Those of us that have travelled on a train will have had thoughts of the houses that we pass along the route. Mine have included wondering how people can live so close to a train line and why some houses don't have blinds, because people are bound to look in. I do anyway, it's almost like they are inviting you to look. Rachel, one of the narrators in this novel takes it a few steps further than just having a nose though, and actually invents a life for two of the people she sees daily on her commute, she even gives them names, seeing them as having the perfect life. I guess this could all sound very innocuous at first, most of us people watching in public will invent scenarios for some of the people that we see, yet this being a psychological thriller it isn't long before things take a rather sinister turn and this book becomes very, very addictive.The only problem I have is trying to write this review without giving the story away, yet it's hard to discuss the book in detail without revealing stuff. All I can say this is an absolutely thrilling read, and one that you won't want to put down. I experienced many emotions reading this book, but the ones I felt the most were shock and anger. Especially towards the character of Rachel who isn't likeable in the slightest and despite the fact there are reasons why she is the way she is, I just struggled to sympathise with her. Having three narrators allows us as a reader to see the full picture, at times it felt almost wrong to know so much about the three of them whilst they were often in the dark. Not knowing which characters were trustworthy meant that I read the book almost on edge. It's essentially a classy whodunnit, with some truly messed up characters in the frame, but I found it easy to put characters into one of two piles, 'Maybe' and 'Contrived'. I really hope this doesn't spoil the book so perhaps you might want to look away but there is an especially hateful character that Paula has created here, and for me certain aspects of the story felt a little obvious and, for the most part, far too female.Paula Hawkins writes expertly, debut novels rarely get much better than this and I predict Paula is going to be a star in this genre, and The Girl on the Train is going to be a memorable novel in 2015 that everybody will be talking about, and rightly so. This book is almost perfect for a film, and towards the end I was playing director in my head imagining how the shots for some tense and haunting scenes could be shot. (I studied Film Studies at A Level...) The book ended and I just sat there for a few minutes thinking about the story I had just read, letting my heart resume its normal rhythm. I would advise you to pick up this book as soon as you can, it's a book everybody will be talking about, and it's a lot better than the rubbish book people are comparing it to so ignore those comparisons. Those that read this book will probably never look out of a train window the same again."
1074,Carly,Rezension folgt.
1075,Bonnie,"Oooh...a fast read because I couldn't put it down! Yes, it's a bit like ""Gone Girl"" in that you can't trust your main characters. It's also like a good Hitchcock mystery (and I couldn't guess who done it!) but it also stands alone; I don't know if I've read a book quite like this. The book also made me want to ride a train and have a few drinks. Or NOT have any drinks if you know this book! Enjoy... "
1076,Barbara Schultz," 4.7 As I am stingy with stars!!! I totally love psychological thrillers .. COULD NOT put this down today and just finished. Although the less you know about this book ahead of time the better, but I want you and ALL my friends to read it so we can talk about it!!!!! Book is an amazing first novel for author Paula Hawkins!!"
1077,Kathryn,"While the writing style took a bit to get used to, the story of Character A, on different dates scattered in time, than B on similar dates, it took a while to get into. I sat on a plane and read this book in one go. The Plot twist at the end was unexpected, but not unpredictable at the end. So it wasn't too shocking.A good read but I think that had I been reading it in bits at a time, I would not have enjoyed this book."
1078,Entre mis libros y yo,"Muy entretenido. Prácticamente lo he devorado, estaba deseando ver si se confirmaba mi sospecha inicial y acerté. "
1079,Catarina,"A sinopse não é nada fidedigna à história e às personagens relevantes, ppr isso não se fiem. É um romance interessante e que vai captando a atenção. O final está interessante e não se adivinha de início e as várias personalidades das personagens fazem com que haja um dinamismo fácil de ler. Aconselho. Lê - se bem uma vez."
1080,Edanur Ecin,"13 gün sonra sonunda bitti. Okurken gerçekten krizler geçirdim. Kitap aslında güzel ama ben polisiye gerilim tarzı kitapları pek sevmiyorum, genelde de hep yarım bırakıyorum zaten ama Trendeki Kız'dan gerçekten ümitliydim. Dayanabildiğim kadar dayandım ve sonunda... Kitap ilk 150 sayfada o kadar yavaş ilerliyor ki yani her gün aynı olaylar oluyor hiçbir şey yok o yüzden de aşırı sıkıldım. Ama daha sonra yavaş yavaş olaylar gelişti küçük ipuçları ortaya çıktı ve kendimi bir anda katilin kim olduğunu tahmin etmeye çalışırken buldum. Kitabı okuduğum sırada herkes hiç tahmin edilemeyen biri falan dediği için en küçük detaya bile dikkat etmeye çalıştım ama gerçekten hiç tahmin etmediğim biri çıktı. Kitabın bu gerilim sayfalarını din dersinde okuduğum için baya baya gerildim şddmkfkd Bitirebildiğim ilk polisiye/gerilim kitabıydı ve ben bile bitirebildiysem bu kitap gerçekten güzel demektir. Eğer polisiye/gerilim seviyosanız zaten alın ama eğer sevmiyorsanız bir şans vermeye değer diyorum ben. Kitaba puanım da ilk 150 sayfa yüzünden 4/5 eğer o sayfalar da da ufak ufak hareketlenmeler ufak ufak ipuçları olsaydı kesinlikle 5/5ti"
1081,Fiona,"I didn't read Gone Girl and probably won't because I know the ending. For fans of Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train can be recommended as a read-alike. I figured out the twist just before it was revealed, but it kept my attention the entire time. Fast-paced read..."
1082,Yadira  Denisse,"This book is a great read!!! It is nothing what I expected...it was better!! It kept me guessing on what could have happened on the night the alcoholic character blacked out! It kept me annoyed at her for being so stupid about continuing her drinking. I was so annoyed at her poor decision making. I was also so annoyed at her ex-husbands need to continue being there for her after everything that they went through. Her obsession with this strangers was so weird, it made no sense to me. At the same time I could see this in real life...it was captivating! I could not have actually guessed what happened until I was right up there....wow! "
1083,Karen.s,"It's impossible not to think of Gone Girl when reading this book, though Gone Girl remains superior. Neither book has likable characters to root for, though you are compelled to keep reading. Both have highly manipulative characters and a chilling atmosphere.I like that even though this book is a thriller, a genre which usually doesn't offer anything more than an exciting ride, there is a lot under the surface. The main theme is our perception of reality vs. the reality we see on tv. Rachel, the main character, spends her days riding the train to London, passed the suburb she used to live in before her husband cheated on her and left her for the other woman. She always keeps an eye out for a beautiful couple whose life she imagines as Hollywood perfect. The reality is other. When the truth shatters the observed reality, Rachel tries to get involved to ""fix"" things. It is quite an exploration of how much we try to participate in the reality presented to us on tv. The drawback is the ending, which is contrived and feels manipulative.By the last quarter of the book, it is easy to anticipate every event. It's a shame, because the book has a lot going for it."
1084,Javier García Flores,"Desde que leí la reseña del libro me pareció muy interesante, es esa clase de libro que te atrapa desde las primeras paginas, te envuelves en los personajes y te sientes identificado en como piensan o reaccionan en circunstancias que ocurren en la historia del libro. Cada personaje tiene sus tormentos guardados que van demostrándolos en el pasar de las hojas y la conexión que tiene cada uno con los otros personajes lo hace mas emocionante. Lo recomiendo de todas maneras si quieren leer un buen libro de misterio e intriga hasta el final."
1085,dluvsbooks,"Entertaining, similar to Gone Girl. I found it very drawn out and wanted it to get ""on with it already!"" Somewhat repetitious. Loved the characterization though, brilliant."
1086,Rogier,3.75/5
1087,Abigael,"I enjoyed it, it kept my interest right the way through. I felt certain parts of the story lacked depth and needed further explanation but it kept me hooked regardless! "
1088,Nona,"Rachel is a mess, pretending to go to work each day and I did not have much sympathy for her. But, as the story evolves, so did my feelings about the characters in this novel. Couldn't read it fast enough to figure out what was going on!!!"
1089,Pam Sweigert,"I kind of feel bad about not liking this book more than I do! I had a lot of friends love it and recommend it, and while I did like it, I didn't LOVE it. Basically I would say it's okay plus. It was interesting and a smooth read, I thought some of the Rachel parts were a little repetitive and started to become a little tedious, but not overly so. It's definitely different then anything I've read before which I love about it. I guess maybe I'm a little disappointed that I was able to figure out ""who done it"" with about 100 pages left of the book. I was hoping to be wrong, I love being shocked! I realize that authors have a fine line to walk trying to give you hints without giving it away, I just caught on to something she said and figured it out before I would have liked. Don't get me wrong the rest of the book was still an interesting read and the ending satisfying, I guess I just don't necessarily get all the hype. I still give this book a solid 4 stars and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a murder/mystery that's a little something different. "
1090,☼♎ Carmen the Bootyshaker Temptress ☼♎,The beginning started out a little slow but it progressed throughout the story. At first I thought Rachel was just a needy drunk who thought she could get her ex-husband back but while she was staking her ex-husband she witnessed something but she tends to forget or mix her memories due to her drinking that not even the police believe her. As she tries to figure out what happened the night Megan disappeared she gets herself into more trouble. In the end she figures out what really happened and more. I did ended up being a really good book. 
1091,Aj the Ravenous Reader,"  “There is something comforting at the sight of strangers safe at home.”  I admit that I’m no expert when it comes to this genre. In fact, as to date, I have only read three books including this that falls under this category, so I will have to base my review on the general impact of the novel to me to the best of my ability without any spoiler as I perfectly know that these kinds of books need to be read without spoiler. In my personal opinion, this book passes the mystery-thriller-suspense-crime criteria with flying colors! What makes me say this has a great deal to do with the hypnotic writing style of the author- there is something eerie but magnetic with it and it is a huge mystery to me how the author is able to put across layers of meanings in the simplest thoughts and the most mundane phrases the female characters who are also the narrators utter. It is also noteworthy how the author, in order to craft this forbidding tale, deftly chose these three women who are most flawed and most foolish and yet are unexplainably capable of receiving the reader’s empathy. Of the three POV’s, I was most glued to that of Rachel’s (the major character) whose loneliness seems to magnify her imagination which consequently becomes the core of the plot. (Read the book for the story and the plot)What strikes me more in the story is the absence of the dark comic tone which was very common in the other books I have read of the same sort. This exception, I think is what makes this book more realistic and well darker and more sinister. It is also quite impressively baffling that the plot seems both linear and rounded at the same time. I felt like nothing happens so much but at the same time, it also felt like everything is happening and unraveling right under my nose and I couldn’t control my heart from hammering against my chest. There were times I had to stop reading and allow the creeps to surface above my skin.Finally, I couldn’t help but notice how stories under this genre seem to have one common theme and that is how people will crucially suffer the worst possible consequence of (view spoiler)[ infidelity  (hide spoiler)]. I just hope the moral purpose of stories like this reaches the intended audience.^^ One helpful tip in solving mysteries: Suspect the person who you least suspect or better yet, suspect everybody.^^ "
1092,Mich,Others have compared to Gone Girl and I'd agree to some extent just not as twisted. This was an engrossing good read- just not great
1093,Melissa Hinnen,page turnerCouldn't put it down. Once I got to the halfway point I just kept going. Great writing. Love the different voices pulling the story together little by little. 
1094,Mrs. Reed,"I read this book in one sitting, pretty much, as Zack drove us home from Missouri. It had actually been a while since I finished a book, and it felt good to read one like this that I could just rip through. I found it to be supremely entertaining and perfectly paced. In a way, it made me a little mad, because this is a book I would have loved to have written, but I don't think I could have done it this well. I watch what's going on during my train commute all the time, inside the car, out the window, while waiting on the platform, even while buying tickets. Hawkins took that commuter experience and made it something really, really special.Spoilers from here.When I was a kid, I hated books in which there were no likable characters. Why would I want to form a relationship with characters if I wouldn't have formed relationships with them in real life? For the most part, I stick to that idea. In this book, though, I just don't think it's necessary. Rachel is definitely sympathetic, and grows more so the more we learn about her, but I certainly wouldn't have the energy or patience to be her friend. I definitely would hate to have her as a co-worker or roommate. Somehow, though, I was rooting for her, even though I was pretty sure she had ""done it."" As I was reading, I was saying to myself, ""If Hawkins can somehow turn this around so that another character was the murderer, I'll be surprised."" I couldn't believe how seamlessly she dropped all her foreshadowing without my noticing. I don't know if I've ever hated a character as much as I hate Anna. Even at the end, when she's somewhat almost okay, I just can't stand her. Obviously, I've read books where characters have done worse things than Anna does in this book--there are even characters in this book who have done worse things than Anna. She's just so perfectly real in her evilness. She is the real kind of horrible that real people who are fairly accepted in society act. What a B.My favorite was how the book started out with Rachel creating a little story about the people she passed on the train every day. I loved how expertly Hawkins used that and segued into this really cool thriller."
1095,Jayne Niemi,"I still don't like bouncing between character points of view. That said, when the plot turned, I turned those pages faster. I liked it far better than Gone Girl, to which it seems often compared, probably because there actually was an ending."
1096,Gilda Felt,"I’m not normally a reader of mysteries, but I kept running into reviews of this book–both good and bad. Finally, I walked into the library, and there it was, staring me in the face. It seemed like fate.Luckily, I did enjoy it, which was odd considering that I didn’t like any of the main characters. The story is told from the perspective of Rachel, Rachel’s ex-husband’s new wife, Anna, and Megan, the woman who lives nearby and who baby-sat for Anna’s baby. They, along with Tom, Rachel’s ex-husband, are all terribly self-centered, unpleasant people, who basically end up getting what they deserve. The only nice character in the book comes across as something of a patsy.What I did especially enjoy about the book was that none of these people can actually by totally trusted, so the reader is never sure if what they’re saying is the total truth. It’s their truth, just not the truth. To a certain degree, I suppose that can be said of a lot of people. Here, it adds a level of suspense, as the reader isleft to work through the clues each drops.It’s a fast read, and I figured out who the killer was about two-thirds of the way through the book. Still, I’d say it’s a nice, little page-turner that held my interest."
1097,Cynthia Corral,"Am I the last person on earth to read this book? Probably, so I'm not going to bother with a detailed review. I will say that I liked it, I really really liked it, and really enjoyed reading it... until the end.As soon as ""the bad guy"" started confessing all the details, OMG my worst pet peeve, I was ready to take a star off right then, but I was still hesitating because I enjoyed the rest so much. But then the end devolved into the same damn ending that Stephen King often resorts to. (view spoiler)[The angry abusive husband/ex-husband terrorizes the women and tries to kill them and they manage to turn the tables, The End.  (hide spoiler)] Ho Hum. At that point, there was no way I was giving it 5 stars. So there you go. I did enjoy trying to figure out who ""the bad guy"" was, and I'd like to say that I guessed, but I guessed them all at one point or another so I actually was surprised when it started to become obvious. I know many people hated the characters too, but I thought it was quite interesting how all the characters were pretty much scumbags. At least it wasn't JUST the men, or JUST the women, it was EVERYONE. And I loved how the story was told, and the different time periods actually worked really well.So I really did enjoy it, but the end, well, it was just a lazy-pants dime a dozen ending."
1098,Linda Doyle,"At some point while reading this, I started to think of it as ""The Cuckoo on the Choo-Choo."" Good story, but what a frustrating, sad, pathetic leading lady. I call her leading lady because I'm sure this will become a movie. It has all the ingredients: eerie atmosphere, puzzling whodunit plot, and some seriously damaged characters. I did find it hard to read at times because Rachel, the cuckoo, is tiresome. Rachel is a drunk, and one of the best depictions of an alcoholic that I've ever read. She is in the throes of her addiction and behaves desperately to get what she thinks she wants, to protect a man from being accused of murder. What she should want is to get sober because her life is rapidly unraveling. But her irrational behavior drives the plot to a wild ride of a climax, a kind of silly one, unfortunately. The killer is cartoonish and stands around blabbing about his/her evil deeds while threatening to harm the leading lady. Who does that, except on bad cop shows? Despite the silly climax, the story carries this book and makes it a mostly entertaining and interesting read."
1099,Susan,"If I would have had this book on a day off I would have read it in one sitting. Yes, I did figure it out, but only a page or two before you were ""supposed"" to. I like I book where I both like, and dislike, a narrator. This book gave me that. I see people comparing it to Gone Girl - I guess I can see why, as you have an unreliable story teller, but really this book can stand on it's own. It doesn't need to rely on Gone Girl's coattails."
1100,K,"The book snob in me wavered about the fourth star, but sometimes timing is everything. I've been feeling a little overwhelmed by my various projects and desperately needed a beach trip and a pageturner that didn't demand too much from me. I got to enjoy both of those today, and this being the book, I'll err on the side of adding that fourth star.Much of this book is narrated by Rachel, whose life has basically fallen apart. An alcoholic whose husband has left her for another woman, she has been fired from her job and keeps up the pretense of traveling on the train that takes her to and from work in order to avoid the well-intentioned censure and rescue efforts of her roommate. Traveling on the train, Rachel develops a fascination with a couple whose house she passes en route -- a couple who happens to live very close to her old house, which is now shared by her ex and his new wife and child. Rachel's fixation on this couple and her imagined narratives about their existence take a life of their own when she learns from the news that Megan Hipwell, the woman of the couple, has abruptly and mysteriously disappeared. The investigation gives Rachel a much-needed purpose in life, with surprising effects. Smaller sections of the book are narrated by Megan at earlier points in time leading up to her disappearance, and by Anna, Rachel's ex-husband's new wife.There's certainly what to criticize. Having Anna narrate her few sections felt a bit contrived and forced to me; I think Hawkins should have just stuck with juxtaposing Rachel's and Megan's narratives. And despite much-hyped comparisons, this is not the new Gone Girl; if you're expecting that type of read you'll probably be disappointed.That being said, this book kept me engaged and turning pages. I felt Rachel's pain, and grew increasingly curious both about what would happen to her and what had happened to Megan. I usually read books for characterization more than plot, and admittedly here the plotting was far more clever than the characterization. In this case, though, it was nice to have a good beach read to coincide with a trip to the beach. Incidentally, I will note that I tried this on audio earlier and couldn't follow it at all; one of those cases where I feel the book really works much better in print."
1101,christa,"The highlight of Rachel’s day is this little hiccup-length stall in her commute that happens within plain view of Jess and Jason’s home, where sometimes she sips coffee on the porch and he stands behind her providing the sort of tender touches that make couplehood look so enticing. Okay, so their names probably aren’t Jess and Jason. And all the tales of hearts and romance that she’s created in her head are merely the fan fiction that accompanies the premade Gin & Tonics that she drinks from cans on the train. Okay, and there is something else: Not-Jess and Not-Jason just happen to live a few doors down from Rachel’s old house where her ex-husband and his current wife -- the one he left her for -- and their baby live. Rachel, the unreliable though likable character at the center of Paula Hawkins’ “The Girl on the Train,” didn’t know this handsome couple when she lived in the neighborhood, they’re newbies, fascinating newbies who have just what she covets with her ex, Tom. I guess it’s not too much to reveal that Rachel’s commute isn’t one of necessity. She lost her job weeks ago. That Gin in a Can thing isn’t recreational. It’s a very real, very present numbing tactic that she regularly employs -- so regularly that she’s alienated all sorts of people. Her only champion is a former high school classmate, a do-gooder who mostly vacuums around the soiled clothing. Rachel gets a jarring visual during a certain train ride that 180s her opinion of Miss Jess. She chases it with a rip-roarin’ rager. She wakes from a black out drunk a bit bloody and unable to trace the events of the previous night or explain the pissed off voicemail messages from Tom. And Jess, who is actually named Megan, is missing. This book is pretty gripping. The idea of a black out drunk at the center of a crime is totally brill. Also, Hawkins finds a way to make you root for Rachel even when you want to wrap her in a coat, drive her home, lock her in her room and hide her phone. In alternating perspectives, we also get in the head of Megan and Tom’s new wife. Neither are as compelling. Megan is perpetually dissatisfied; Anna isn’t as strong as she could be about the meddling drunk who hangs out on the periphery of her life doing completely inappropriate things. Megan’s husband Scott’s motives are hard to follow and Tom is a bit wishy washy. But Rachel. Rachel is recognizable and fully realized and makes up for any other character shortcomings. I didn’t want to put this one down. "
1102,Carolin,"I didn't expect the characters to be like this. But their personal failures made them seem human and one could relate to them easily. Moreover, I was positively surprised by the ending because I expected everything but this. A real pageturner!"
1103,Claire Booking ,"4,5 en realidad. Tiene un final muy poco explosivo, me lo esperaba muchísimo mejor, de todos modos el desarrollo de la novela es genial, inesperado y adictivo, me ha encantado :)"
1104,Nicole Zupich,Gave into the hype - was not disappointed. Way better than Gone Girl (though they are completely different).
1105,Spencer,"Given its content and style, and the recent success of Gillian Flynn, The Girl on the Train sort of begs comparison to Gone Girl. For me it felt kind of like Gone Girl-light. Similar intrigue, similar twists and turns, not quite so dark or complicated. I enjoyed it very much. Entertaining, it kept me guessing, maybe not all the way until the end, but well through the story. All of the characters, even the ones we were supposed to like, had flaws, and that seemed real enough. I liked the descriptions of commuting and what that experience is like. Loved this line: ""There's something comforting about the sight of strangers safe at home."" (p. 2). Comforting and discomforting. I could easily see this whole story developing as the product of out-the-window mental meandering as we decompress on our way home from yet another busy day. I would definitely read more from her.P.S.On the cover of the book, there is a quote from Tess Gerritsen: ""So thrilling and tense and wildly unpredictable it sucked up my entire afternoon. Not to be missed."" Wait, what? That she has the luxury of reading a 300+ page novel in an afternoon reminds me yet again that I am in the wrong line of work. "
1106,Patty,"Every day Rachel takes the train into London, pretending she still has a job to go to, while frequently downing canned gin and tonics. As the houses flash by she fixates on the couple in one of them, imagining their golden fantasy life. Then one day she witnesses something that shatters this imagined life and by extension Rachel's own existence. She becomes involved in a police investigation where her habits of black outs make her a less than reliable witness. When a missing person turns into a murder case her ex-husband and his new wife are exasperated as they find themselves drawn into Rachel's drama. Her one supportive friend is losing patience and Rachel's money is running out. Can she trust her own memories? Hawkins writes plainly without much embellishment but keeps the tension high so you'll find yourself wanting to stay up late to read just one more chapter. There's no mid-book Gone Girl big reveal; instead you need to read to the bitter end to find out if Rachel's obsession is real or the product of a sozzled brain. "
1107,Kristín Jónsdóttir,"Sat pikkföst yfir þessari sérkennilegu sögu, sem ég las í sumarfríinu mínu. Ég hef ekki getað hætt að hugsa um aðalpersónuna og örlög hennar. Eini gallinn við þessa bók er líklega sá að maður fær netta óbeit á áfengi :)"
1108,Christine (AR),"Dear Thriller Book Marketers: Stop comparing new releases to Gone Girl. That just sets my expectations much too high, and I'm invariably disappointed. K?This book is good, no question. Read it in a day, rushed to get to the answers, enjoyed the unreliable narrator(s) immensely. I say you should get it. Read it. Just don't expect Gillian Flynn. "
1109,Yashira Negron,"Its taken me quite some time to finish this book, but I'm so glad I did. Its pretty interesting, since I had no idea who it could have been. This entire time, I kept questioning, who could it be, who could it be. I trusted almost no one. But when I found out who it was I was like duh! Of course, makes sense! That is what I like about a good mystery, that I have no idea who it is, but once I find out I'm like yes, finally. Its a shame I don't read much mystery, as I love my fantasy and sci-fi. But now, I think I'll go on a little bit of a mystery binge.I really enjoyed Paula Hawkins writing style, especially that we see the perspective of Megan, Rachel and even Anna. Honestly, I disliked almost everyone when I first met them, even Cathy, Rachel's flat mate. But the character development, wow, it was amazing. Some I started to HATE others I felt such mixed emotions. But I enjoyed the fact that the characters were believable, that there are really people out there like this. Sometimes you read a book and you're like I don't feel any emotion for this person, not at all realistic, I can't deal. But this book was great, I felt quiet a lot of emotion, there was even a part were I cried cause I just could not deal, even had to put it down. But anyways, I definitely recommend this book. I don't want to keep telling you about the book because it will give away things, and I surely do NOT want to spoil anyone. If you like mysteries, definitely check it out. "
1110,Clare,"I was going to avoid this book as I didn't like the sound of it and thought it sounded boring, but it wasn't at all it kept me glued to the pages and I found myself not able to put it down.I changed my mind about who I liked or disliked and who I thought did what to whom several times which I enjoyed as most books it can become quite clear who the ""bad"" guy/girl is early on in the story.Would definitely recommend it to others."
1111,Shahirah Loqman,"So after months of searching for this book, I finally found this in a local bookstore and read it soon after. I've heard so many great reviews of this book. And I gave it 4 stars mainly because it had a really solid plot with unique POV from 3 different women at almost similar time frames. Hawkins showed us a bit of the future then flash backed to how the future came to be. I really liked the suspense created, but unfortunately I found the plot a bit too slow. I was expecting immediate drama/suspense but it came a bit late -- in the middle of the book I believe. And I figured out the plot twist before Hawkins revealed the person :D Now that was fun to do. I rarely read thrillers, so that was a new experience for me. Other than that, it's a really captivating read. I understand why it's so popular. I felt such a strong emotional relation with the main character, sometimes I feel like helping her, sometimes I want to slap her. Any author who makes me feel this way about their characters is a good one.A recommended read from me. Hope you enjoy it ;) "
1112,Susie Findell,"Wow! This book was amazing! At first, I was just interested. Then over time, I found myself annoyed at the chief protagonist...I have no patience for women who are victims of their own behavior. Then, boom! The book picked up steam (at 3 a.m. when I woke up sleepless) and I could not put it down until I finished it at 4:30 a.m. Really good! This is the new ""Gone Girl"" and I highly recommend it."
1113,Anne OK,"New-to-me author and a new psychological thriller makes for a great weekend of reading.Same train - every morning - everything the same - until one morning when Rachel sees something shocking and then nothing is the same again.This tale is told from the POV of three different voices - one is an alcoholic, another a liar, and the other a cheater, making this story even more intriguing. Behind closed doors no one can ever be sure what is taking place.An impressively written dark and gritty thriller. Keeps readers dizzy while trying to piece the puzzle together!"
1114,Virginia Cope,"Liars and cheaters and alcoholics--OH MY! ""Twisting the corkscrew in, farther and farther, ripping into his throat..."" This single line warranted an additional star for me with this book. I'm not quite a fan of this genre of literature but this was definitely a page turner for me. If only to get to the actual ""meat"" of the story in order to understand what the hell it was that I had been reading. There was no character that I connected with as they were all completely batshit crazy and I believe that is quite an understatement. About half way through I made the statement that I wish this book was about a girl on a train that experiences a train crash and the entire book is taking place in her head while she is in a coma...then she dies. My naive mind wishes that the world didn't have these type of people in it however, I'm not dumb enough to think that people like Hannibal don't really exist. All in all, i'm sure for some people it was a home run. It was decent and I finished it in 24 hours which means that it was gripping enough for me to lose sleep over. Take that as you may. At least I've knocked out one of those less desirable books on my reading challenge. "
1115,Mitali,"An absolute page turner! It doesn't have a single moment of boredom. The fact that the drama unfolds as first person accounts of multiple central characters makes it quite intriguing; it kept me engaged without compelling me to get over involved with any one specific character. Also, while at the heart of this story is a murder investigation, the book carries no sense of urgency or desperation to incriminate anyone. Things seem to fall into place as a result of the circumstances and actions of the people involved. This was quite a welcome change from a lot of regular thrillers that generally lay great emphasis on details of police interrogation, the search for evidence etc. The end sort of lacks spunk, as compared to the rest of the story that has you hooked right from the beginning. But ultimately, all you feel for Hawkins is appreciation, for providing 336 pages of sheer enthralling entertainment!"
1116,Colleen,"As a reviewer said in US Today, “Here come the ‘Gone Girl’ knock-offs!” In all fairness, who knows? Maybe this book was written before ‘Gone Girl’ and has been floating around publishers for years. But if you loved ‘Gone Girl,’ you will probably love this book.I didn’t love it, but boy, did it hold my attention. If I hadn’t been so busy, I would have read it all in one go. I had to force myself to put it down and go to bed. And then, it would keep me up at night. I won’t say much because I run the risk of giving something away. There are twists at every turn. I had no idea what was going to happen right up until the very end. The very end. And then, I still wasn’t sure. I had to flip back to make sure I was understanding it correctly. The plot is suspenseful. The author is constantly throwing in little bits like: “I don’t know whether they see me, though, for what I really am.” Huh? “What” are you, Rachel? Or: “On the way back down the road, he passes me in his car, our eyes meet for just a second and he smiles at me.” Who? Who’s smiling at you, Megan? Or: “What bothers me most is that I haven’t got to the end of my story…” What story? What happened? The stories of the three narrators, Rachel, Megan, and Anna, criss and cross, and go back and forth in time. They intersect, then, come together in the end…and your questions are finally answered. You probably will not have guessed those answers before then. Or you might think you have, then, there’s a twist that proves you wrong. I thought the book was great at keeping you in constant suspense…and constant stress.The way in which it was most like ‘Gone Girl,” was the extremely unlikeable characters. EXTREMELY unlikeable. Every single one of them. I have a problem with books where I can’t like a single character. I guess I prefer books where I can feel some optimism, where I can feel like there are good people in this world. Not here. Look for ‘The Girl on the Train’ at a theatre near you. I’m sure it will be soon. "
1117,Jennifer Lane,"Ride This Train at Your Own PerilThis intense read is a book club selection. The unlikable characters and psychological mystery reminded me of Gone Girl, but differences included the British setting and heavy presence of alcohol muddying the waters. Both books are well-written but leave me cringing from their ick factor.Rachel is a thirty-something alcoholic who takes the same train to the city every day. One flat visible from the tracks houses a beautiful man and woman, and Rachel makes up stories about them and their apparently blissful marriage. Her own marriage to a man named Tom fell apart due to her infertility, resulting alcohol binges, and his affair with a woman who is now his wife.Then one day, from the train, Rachel sees the beautiful woman kissing another man, and she inserts herself into their story. The woman goes missing, possibly the victim of murder. Is Rachel to blame?It's masterful how the author manipulates my feelings for Rachel throughout the novel. She has to watch Tom move on with Anna, who gives him a child, and that poignant scenario engenders sympathy for Rachel. But her continual return to alcohol to deal with her problems grows frustrating. There's also a cold distance to her that makes it tough to feel close to her. Perhaps that's the alcohol fog. This explanation of alcohol blackouts intrigues me:Blacking out wasn't simply a matter of forgetting what had happened, but having no memories to forget in the first place. The theory was that you get into a state where your brain no longer makes short-term memories. And while you're there, in deepest black, you don't behave as you usually would, because you're simply reacting to the very last thing that you THINK happened, because -- since you aren't making memories -- you might not know what the last thing that happened really was.I also found it fascinating when Tom's new wife Anna starts to compare herself to Rachel, a woman she abhors:And now I find myself behaving exactly like Rachel used to: polishing off the half bottle of red left over from dinner last night and snooping around on his computer. It's easier to understand her behavior when you feel like I feel right now. There's nothing so painful, so corrosive, as suspicion.I didn't predict the twist, and the book ended in a satisfying way."
1118,Victor,"I'm certainly not an expert in the mystery/thriller genre, but found this to be a fun read. :-)"
1119,Carol Royce Owen,"Took a break from reading young adult and middle grade books to read an adult novel. This book was given to me by a fellow teacher on the last day of the Boothbay Literacy Retreat, and yes, I, too, have already passed it on. It was a great book of suspense and mystery, although, I did have the ""whodunnit"" figured out about half way through. But, that didn't bother me. I wanted to see how it all played out, and the movement of narrators chapter by chapter keeps the story interesting and moving forward.The narrators are: Rachel, the Girl on the Train, who we quickly discover has an alcohol problem. Traveling on the same train day after day, she makes up stories about a couple she sees, whom she calls Jess and Jason who seem madly in love. They live just a few doors down from where she once lived with her husband until their divorce. Meghan, the girl who turns up missing. This is the same girl that Rachel calls Jess, and on the very day that she goes missing, Rachel has seen her with another man. Certain that this information would be vital to the investigation, Rachel feels she must let the police know, but is surprised when the police consider her an unreliable witness. Anna, the jealous and egocentric woman married to Rachel's ex-husband, who is suspicious of Rachel spending time on her street, especially because of a past history of difficulties. Believe me, none of these narrators are totally likable, they have personality quirks that make you want to shake them and yell at them and tell them to get their lives together. But somehow, you do end up caring about them, and wanting to see them make it in the end. Definitely a good beach read - I read it in about a day and a half."
1120,Stacy Boyles,This story started out very slow. I was kind of bored with it a third of the way through. I greatly disliked almost every character. I had a hard time following 3 women's stories not knowing the connection and keeping up with dates throughout that are not always in order. I think the author tried too hard to confuse the reader on who the killer was and ended up just confusing the reader. I still liked the overall story line. It was entertaining. I listened to this and the narration was good.
1121,Sebastian Alanya Hartley,"I really liked The Girl On The Train! As a big fan of Gillian Flynn I knew that almost NOTHING could compare to her magnificient books so I read TGOTT as it was, a debut novel, and I really enjoyed it! We need to remember that Gone Girl is the third book of Flynn, and her first, Sharp Objects wasnt THAT good compared to Gone Girl! I just cant wait to Paula Hawkins grow as an author and to see her progress through the years :D﻿"
1122,Jennifer Alexis,"This book was entertaining, the characters were...interesting to say the least. I loved it. Kept me interested the entire time. Read it in 2 days. I only wished they had added some more detail in the end. It felt a little rushed to me. A whole month of time missing after the twist at the end. And the end was really unexpected to me."
1123,Tom,"This book was like meeting a cross dressing serial killer who believes the world is controlled by giant turtles orbiting us in satellites and having them only want to talk about the weather, in other words it started off so messed up and crazy (the good interesting kind) but ended up kind of pedestrian. That doesn't make it bad. It was a good mystery, quite readable, and well told, but it was just a bit of wasted potential in a way. The characters seemed bonkers but were really just victims of circumstance, well except for the killer, that character was crazy, but not David Fincher crazy, more like Lifetime movie network crazy. Still great and still worth a read. I very much liked it. "
1124,GraceHogan,"** minor spoilersRating: Four out of Five StarsThe Girl on the Train, a thriller novel by Paula Hawkins, was an extremely interesting book that I enjoyed reading. The book contained all the makings of a perfect story: love, hate, obsession, crime, and self-realization. The book kept me on my toes the whole time by making sudden, unexpected twists in the story. Paula Hawkins was really able to engage me as a reader by introducing a simple question with a very complex answer: What happened to Rachel Watson? The Girl on the Train follows the story of Rachel Watson, at 32-years old she has already gone through a painful divorce caused by her dependency on alcohol. Every day, Rachel rides a train to and from London. One day, she notices a beautiful couple out on the deck. Although she doesn’t even know them, in her head Rachel renames them Jason and Jess and imagines how perfect their lives are together. However, while she is reading the paper, Rachel sees that “Jess” has gone missing and her real name is Megan Hipwell. Convinced that she must have done something in an alcohol-fueled rage, Rachel decides to further investigate the disappearance of Megan. Unbeknownst to her, this investigation would lead her to the most painful reminder of the life that she used to have, her ex-husband Tom.Unlike so many other crime books that I have read, The Girl on the Train was able to keep things interesting without confusing me. If I had one complaint about the book, it would be that it was a little too mature for me but that is not the author’s fault at all. Personally, I would recommend the book to someone in their thirties or above. I found that I couldn’t relate to any of the characters’ situations because they were very “adult” problems. Paula Hawkins was able to create a fascinating, intriguing novel that was hard for me to put down. In fact, the book was so interesting that I forgot that I was reading it for school and it began to take up my free time because I couldn’t wait to see what would happen next.  One of things I found to be the most interesting in the book was the way that Rachel viewed her people-watching: “Twice a day, I am offered a view into other lives, just for a moment. There's something comforting about the sight of strangers safe at home,” (Hawkins 4). I, like many others, love to know what’s going on in people’s lives but I almost always forget what they said and move on. However, Rachel views her people-watching as a view into their lives. Hawkins introduces this thought fairly early on in the novel which allowed me to see that Rachel is so unhappy in her own life, that the best way for her to feel better is by imaging how perfect other peoples’ lives are. In conclusion, I think that The Girl on the Train was an excellent book. I would love to read it again in 15 years or so, so that I can see if my thoughts on it change as I gain maturity. I really enjoyed reading this book for my SRP project and I look forward to next quarter’s project."
1125,Sumaiyya Naseem,I really enjoyed reading this! I'm not one for thrillers so it was a good change from my reading habits. The ending could have been better though. And I felt the female characters were too similar. It's a great read for a lazy weekend.
1126,Cora,Great read! It reminds me of Gone Girl in the sense of the suspense element that works in this piece. Recommended
1127,Dani Duffy,"This book is nice and easy to read, the language helps you relax and relate to the characters involved. I found it a bit slow going to begin with but then the twist came and I couldn't put it down"
1128,Bharmon,"Really, it's a 3.5 but I had to round up for goodreads. It's not a showstopper, but it's a good, effortless summer read. "
1129,Ken,"Messed up, but good."
1130,Jayne Thorold,"I read this first on the kindle then was lucky enough to get it in hard back. The biggest negative to this book is that in places it is quite confusing,and there was a few times I had to re read a page or so again to understand it. I went through periods of liking and hating Rachel in equal amounts. Her character came over as very weak and vulnerable,obviously because of her addiction,but it drove me nutty. I wanted her,even in the early chapters,to pick herself up and stop acting a victim. Did the author want to portray weak women? As in fact I found all three main women characters weak and submissive. Two only coming stronger in the final pages.  On the whole though a really good read. For obvious reasons,it was easy to guess 'whodunnit' quite early on in the book,but that didn't deter my enjoyment of it. A good read on s nice long train journey. "
1131,Pat Bailey,"4.5 starsThe train has arrived! …..with suspense, mystery, secrets and startling truths intertwined in this novel. The main character Rachael is a protagonist, not all that likable and resorts to the bottle to get through daily life which is teetering on the edge. She is divorced by her husband and has lost her job. Keeping the job loss a secret from her roommate, she continues to ride the train into the city every day, pretending to go to work. On the train ride, Rachael observes a couple on their home patio along the train route to town. She begins to create a ""perfect couple"" story about them, comparing them to her life prior to her divorce when she lived only a few doors down from them. Her ex-husband is remarried to Anna and with a toddler they now live in the house Rachael once shared with her ex.Enter “perfect couple” Megan who goes missing on a day Rachael has drank herself into a black out. The story is told from three different viewpoints, Rachael, Anna and Megan each giving a slightly different take on the story. There are a number of characters and all are complex and flawed. They lie, cheat and deceive and so nothing is really as it first appears and, more importantly, nobody is as they first seem. The plot was excellent; the pace and intrigue made this a page turner. "
1132,Amanda Hendsbee,"This book got off to a horribly slow start, and I nearly gave up for that reason. I had heard nothing but good things, though, and I decided to power through it anyway. I'm incredibly glad I did, because it got so much better. I figured out who the killer was before it was revealed, but that didn't stop me from enjoying it. If you're a fan of the Millennium series or Gone Girl, you will probably enjoy this."
1133,Hillary Smith,"For sure entertaining- I did read it in 24 hours. I found the plot to be pretty depressing and a little annoying. The women characters were disappointing. Really I didn't like any of the characters. I became mostly annoyed by their idiocy. While a quick read it didn't spark any emotional attachment to anything. I'm giving it 4 stars purely for the entertainment factor, not really for a good book rating. Overrated really."
1134,Erica,4.5 stars. What a roller coaster ride. I was guessing up until nearly the end.
1135,Rebekah,"Not my typical book, but it did keep me intrigued. I don't tend to like books that have unlikable narrators. While I didn't like Rachel at first, she did grow on me a bit as she struggled to remember what happened.Solid book for those who like mysteries."
1136,Sheila,"This book is being compared a lot to Gone Girl. And I guess there is a missing woman in this book too, but it's not really a comparison I'd jump to make. It's just not as dark and sinister as Gone Girl. It doesn't give off the same vibe. That being said, similar to Gone Girl, the characters aren't particularly likable. But I was still invested in their lives, even if I thought they made stupid decisions and didn't always agree with them. The writing style of this book is very straightforward and almost clinical. But it works. The story is told from three perspectives in two different timelines. Each gave something different to the story which I liked. Even though in my opinion the voices didn't feel very different. The only complaint that I really had was that the police didn't feel very present for a book about a crime. It's a minor complaint because I know it wasn't told from that perspective and that this wasn't a police procedural; but I couldn't help but wish we saw a little more of that aspect through the characters eyes because it felt like they weren't really doing anything at all. Overall this was a fast read that I enjoyed."
1137,Kathryn Burak,"Any comparisons to GONE GIRL, for me, are left behind with the missing girl plot. In many ways this is a better book.Though the book is mainly told through Rachel's eyes, two other women's stories add to this thriller that is reminiscent of Hitchcock. Rachel's main storyline guides us through her boozy, blurry, voyeuristic observations from the train window: a couple who share a house a few doors away from a house she recently shared with her ex-husband. There were a lot of coincidences that reminded me this was fiction, and the proximity of the houses was one of them. Still, I couldn't put the story down, and I rooted for Rachel to stop doing stupid things and pull herself together. When the woman who lives in the house near Rachel's ex's home goes missing, of course Rachel is all over that. Why? Well, she's created a fiction for the couple--Jess and Jason (not really, but in her mind). She's also seen ""Jess"" kissing someone who wasn't ""Jason."" She's also realistically needy in the way addicts are--lonely, obsessive, compulsive when drunk.I'm reminded of Rear Window. Characters don't know how public their lives are, and the ""gaze"" of onlookers seems both a little righteous and a little prurient. Isn't it your right to look out the train windows and observe? Isn't it also something to be ashamed of? Among the strong parts of the book are the different ""windows"" into the three women's lives. Herein lies one of my complaints, though--the voices sometimes blended together and the women tended to stay within their types (frustrated mom, vixen, barren lady). I didn't buy that Rachel became an alcoholic because she couldn't get pregnant, and I didn't buy that line about women only being valued for beauty and motherhood. Besides, if motherhood is such an overwhelming desire, why not adopt? The theme of being hot and pretty (and blonde!) came up a bunch--and I felt myself craving more behind all of the surface stuff.All that said, the logic of the both the mystery and Rachel's psychology work together well. I saw the ending coming, but that didn't bother me. A very worthwhile read. "
1138,L.E. Fraser,"Rachel’s life is off the rails. Unable to conceive, her husband leaves her for another woman and immediately has a baby. The twice-daily journey to and from London forces Rachel to ride by the house she once loved, envisioning the blissful family she lost. She creates a fantasy life for a neighboring couple she sees during her train ride, developing them into the perfect couple. When the woman inexplicably disappears, Rachel injects herself into the investigation, but her alcoholism does more than discredit her. She loses her job, her roommate threatens to kick her out, and the black-outs start. Struggling to differentiate between reality and fantasy, Rachel must uncover the truth over what happened in order to reclaim her life.Told through the eyes of Rachel, her husband’s new wife, and the woman who disappeared, this novel explores an array of issues, including adultery, alcoholism, and loss. The informal style indirectly delineates the characters, making them flawed and real. Rachel’s inability to stop drinking amidst her confusion and desperate need to recall events is poignant. The women’s differences uniquely show their similarities and form reader empathy.This is a character-based novel, with the mystery of the crime placed in the background. It is a successful stylistic device. However, the interjection of past timeline in a mostly chronological sequence is confusing. A linear approach would benefit pacing without sacrificing suspense."
1139,Lara Mcclendon,"Couldn't put this book down. Read it in just one day. 4.5 from me. I'd say 5, but I won't read it again since the mystery is solved for me. But I loved the characters, the drama, the suspense, the twists. Totally recommend this one. "
1140,Bonnie Brody,"Rachel's life is one humongous mess. Her husband Tom, who Rachel still loves and is obsessed with, left her for Anna and they have an infant daughter. Rachel is a drunk and at night she repeatedly calls Tom during her black-outs. Sometimes she even walks past her old house, where Tom and Anna live, and rings the doorbell. She has lost her job but she still rides the train daily to London as if she were still working. She lives with a college friend who is getting sick of her drinking. As Rachel rides the train, she looks into one particular apartment that is near the tracks. Inside, she views a couple who she fantasizes about, even giving them fictional names. She imagines this couple as happy and devoted to one another. One day, however, she sees the woman kissing someone other than her partner and Rachel's cannot get her head around this.The novel is an astute psychological study of one woman's addiction and attempt to hold on to reality. It examines how she instills herself into the lives of others in order to find some meaning in her own life. As she becomes more and more enmeshed in others' lives, her own objectives come into question. There is a lot of action and intrigue in this book. As a clinical social worker, I deal a lot with addictions and this book has one of the best descriptions of alcoholism that I've ever encountered. The personality of Rachel is caught dead-on and I felt like I knew her inside and out. The novel is told from different perspectives, primarily those of Rachel and Anna. It is a real page-turner and difficult to put down. I didn't see the end coming but it all fell into place. Enjoy a fun read and watch out for the movie - I hear it will be out later this year!"
1141,Krista H,"I don't read many thrillers but this one pulls you in and won't let go. Dark, twisted, paranoid and full of secrets and lies. If you think you know people...think again."
1142,Chelsea Bowman,"I really enjoyed this one. I agree with Andi that I hated all of the narrators, but the book kept me guessing for a long time and the end was super suspenseful."
1143,Tiffany,"Reading the description of this book, I was automatically intrigued. The story centers around the lives of three very different women whose lives become intertwined through their varying degrees of separation. The primary protagonist is Rachel Watson, a recent divorcee, whose life is seemingly in shambles. Rachel commutes everyday on the train and in her travels she daydreams about the life of a couple she passes on her daily journey. But as we all know, life is no fairy tale. And thus begins a winding, twisting journey into the lives of the people around us and how nothing is ever really as it seems. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It has had many comparisons to Gillian Flynn's ""Gone Girl"", which a semi-accurate. It is a thriller about a couple and the goings on in their relationship, but that is as close as the two come. ""Gone Girl"" was much darker and I found it to be a better read. But that is just my opinion. ""The Girl on the Train"" is a very good book. It is like an episode of CSI or one of it's similar counterparts. I found the story interesting. The writing was very skillful. I greatly enjoyed the setting of London. The characters were real and flawed as we all are. Every time I picked up this book I was in this world, which is a credit to the author's writing ability. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because I did predict the fairly near the beginning, but that is not to say the book is predictably. Many scenes and outcomes did have a bit of a shock value. I also rated it a 4 because it did lull in a few places that seemed to drag out the outcome. I would read another book by this author without hesitation just to see what she comes up with next. I would recommend this book to fans of psychological thrillers. "
1144,Gail (myJunegirls),"What can I say? I seem to enjoy books that gave characters with no redeeming qualities! Such a cast of interesting people bouncing in and out of this story. You can't really root for anyone, but they make you want more nonetheless! Loved everything about this story. If you are looking for a good thriller, pick it up now."
1145,Kat Schuller,Very well written! Loved the twists and turns. Super fast read! 
1146,Sophia Prades,"Oh, the twists. Oh! THE TURNS!!"
1147,Charlene Vertefeuille,"This was a well written, suspense filled story. It had the sad undertones but definitely kept me up reading late and thinking about the book when I wasn't reading it. Great ending."
1148,Denese Stachowiak,"I had a tough time getting started with this book but eventually it had me hooked. Unlike many reviews, I do not think this is at all like Gone Girl. Sure, there are similarities, but I'm not sure any book can ever take the place of that one. A good read nonetheless."
1149,Martin Kilkenny,"Good, but a slow start."
1150,Melinda Elizabeth,"Let’s stop the comparisons right now. This isn’t “Gone Girl”. And I’m ok with that. Indeed, comparing this novel to Gone Girl can seem a little unfair to Paula Hawkins, as she’s created an intricate thriller here that deserves to stand on its own two feet. Rachel catches the same train every day. She takes in the scenery and observes a couple whose house backs onto the train tracks. They are the epitome of the perfect power couple, strong, lithe, happy and carefree. She anticipates seeing them every day, and creates a narrative to suit their perfect frames. Jess, a successful freelance artist, and Jason, a strong, capable man who looks after his wife and cares for her deeply. Rachel uses the couple as a method of escape – she’s struggling with the truth that her husband left her for another woman, and they are now living her dream life in the house two doors down from Jess and Jason. Its enough to push her close to breaking point. Rachel is struggling with sobriety, living with a friend, and creating a façade that she is still employed and on the mend. The truth is very far indeed from this ideal situation. Rachel harasses and scares her ex-husbands new wife and child, and she hasn’t worked in months. She travels to the city to drink away her worries, and returns home to drink some more. She’s not a particularly enticing character. When there is an awareness of the depth of her problems, its embarrassing to read along and see what she’s doing. You want to shake her a little bit, sober her up and put her on the mend, but reading Rachel’s account is akin to watching an accident in slow motion – there’s nothing you can do to stop the inevitable from happening. After a bender, Rachel wakes up injured, and scared. She can’t recall what happened, and after reading that Megan (her ‘Jess’) has gone missing, Rachel has be terrible feeling that she knows more than she thinks about this crime. Indeed, Rachel has seen Megan with another man, and her perfect life is not as rosy as it should have been. Rachel no longer held Megan in awe, but didn’t expect something like this to happen. We hear from Megan in short bursts throughout the novel – and again, she’s hard to like. She gets what she wants, and if she doesn’t then there’s hell to pay. Megan’s had a tough life, and she’s used to surviving on her terms. Being married to Scott (Rachel called him “Jason”) has given her security, but at what cost? She feels that she’s lost her wild freedom, and is stifled by the life of a housewife. It was only a matter of time before she started looking for something to excite her. Anna, Tom’s new wife, knows she’s the perfect match for him. She’s heard the stories of the crazy alcoholic ex wife, and feels no pity for her. Anna just wishes that she would get the hell out of her life and stop showing up, terrifying her and her daughter Evie. Tom has moved on and Anna feels that they are a strong couple. He would never treat her the same way he treated Rachel. He only cheated because she drove him to it, right? Rachel continues to feel an affinity towards Scott and his missing wife. She speaks to the police, not doing herself any favors in the process, and attempts to get close to Scott to provide the critical news that no-one seems to know – Megan was having an affair with her therapist. As the weeks stretch on and Megan isn’t found, suspicion is cast on Scott as the husband, and the lover in the usual way. But the puzzle pieces aren’t fitting. Will Rachel remember what she knew before it’s too late? The suspicion and intrigue can take a while to build in this novel. It’s a slow burn, with plenty of twists and turns. If you check your “Gone Girl” expectations at the door, you’ll enjoy “The Girl on the Train” for its strong merits. "
1151,Janell," I enjoy books by British authors and/or set in London/Scotland/Wales/Ireland. The Girl on the Train however, was even more enjoyable because of the intrigue and mystery that followed the main characters. Having had a close friendship from childhood with a person who developed alcoholism, allowed me to empathize with Rachel's struggles and know that black outs and being unable to remember events is real. It also caused me to sympathize with Rachel and how her drinking impacted her relationships with others. As I have found myself 'people watching' in airports or other busy, noisy public places, I could also identify with Rachel's overactive mind as she watched people and changes in the scenery out the window of the train. Admittedly, I did find the beginning of the book somewhat confusing as the author jumped back and forth in time and between characters. This would be a difficult book to listen to, via audio. "
1152,El Man Que Lee,"si duda alguna te engancha , una narrativa que te atrapa , con personajes desde un principio bien definidos , la escritora tiene la facilidad de meterte entre sus páginas dando así como resultado que todo lo que pasa en este , es tu mundo y no quieres soltarlo . me gustó este libro un thriller bien hecho en cuanto al final quería que fuera más explosivo , sin embargo estuvo bien , es de esos libros que tiene punto medio que deliveras en cuanto a una puntuación exacta , ya que es tanto el auge de este que esperas algo espectacular.  Un lectura ligera , que engaña , te mantiene en suspenson página tras página . Un lectura recomendada para pasar un buen rato . Puntuación:  3.75 - 4 / 5 "
1153,Kate Beckerman,Dang! Everyone in this book has an issue! Loved it! I listened to the audio on my drive up to NY! 
1154,Mariana Anton,Holy sh*t! 
1155,Beth Covey,"Although there were absolutely no redeeming qualities to any of the characters, this was a bit of a page turner. I figured it out shortly before Rachel did, but I still couldn't put it down. Not having any characters to really pull for, including the deceased, made it a bit disappointing, although there was a glimmer of hope at the end.If you liked Gone, Girl, you will like this one."
1156,Stacy,"***mild/barely spoiler alert***This was great suspense novel, but not quite the next Gone Girl like some are saying. I know some are saying they couldn't like Rachel, but I did. I felt really bad for her but I thought the author did a good job portraying the spiral of an alcoholic. There were quite a few twists and turns and that kept it a page turner for basically the entire book, which is always a good thing. I really liked the ending too. It would have been nice for Tom to elaborate more on his lies from when he was with Rachel, but I guess there was enough to get the point. Overall, a great book I'd definitely recommend."
1157,Rachael Hill,"I had not been this excited to read a book in so long, and I am lucky enough to have a kind mother who bought it for me with the promise that she could read it after me. The premise intrigued me greatly. I myself am guilty of people watching on trains, for the whole of last summer I commuted to and from Manchester every day and began to notice familiar faces. But this is people watching to the extreme! Rachel is a truly disturbing character (I wish we didn't share a name!) and I didn't find her that likeable. However, I found her life, along with Anna and Megan's, addictive. At points I found myself almost cringing at some of her decisions, how she repeatedly returned to Witney even though it spelled trouble every time. Just as she couldn't resist observing her invented character's lives through the train window, I couldn't help but read about her alcohol-fuelled struggles. After recently finishing a book about a dementia sufferer's battle with memory, I couldn't help but feel irritated by Rachel's repeated, and completely avoidable, disregard for both her health and sanity. I think her flatmate Cathy is the saint of the novel, I don't know for how long I could tolerate such behaviour in someone I was living with!That said, I enjoyed Hawkins' ability to release key details slowly, allowing me to piece together bits of evidence alongside Rachel as she slowly gathered memories of ""that night."" Unfortunately, I guessed the culprit pretty early on, and I think that was caused by Hawkins' use of an small character list. The intertwining lives of the limited characters became both effective and detrimental to the mystery. I did quite like the fact that I couldn't trust any of the three female narrators though, they were all slightly on the verge of breakdown which made me do more of the work. I like a book that challenges me and forces me to guess what will happen next.I had to give this book 4 stars because I just felt it lacked something in the ending, but I am not disputing that this is a truly enthralling read, and one that fully deserves the buzz surrounding it."
1158,Jennifer Flynn,"I wasn't sure about this book at first. Several co-workers read it, stated they hated the characters but it had a crazy ending that made it worth it (sound familiar, Gone Girl fans?) I wasn't sure after the first two chapters, is this girl really just on a train the whole book? How boring! The answer is no, she's not on the train and, no, it's not boring. I flew through this book once I got into it. The characters didn't bother me either. Rachel is in a dark place, drinking constantly, feeling rejected and depressed. I definitely felt sympathy for her, at least until she went completely off the rails. Megan is struggling to find herself, feeling lost, and struggling with her own demons. Been there. It's definitely worth a read to see how their lives intertwine and what happens when they do. "
1159,Vikki VanSickle,"I picked this up at an airport and it made my two hour flight delay fly (no pun intended) by. Rachel is having a hard time recovering from a sudden divorce. She has slipped into alcoholism and tortures herself by taking the train by her former house every day, where her husband lives with his new wife and their young child. During these twice daily trips she observes a beautiful young couple and wonders about their lives. When the woman in this couple disappears, Rachel remembers seeing something that could be important. Given the unreliable narrators and issues of contemporary marriage and the way people present their relationships publicly, comparisons to Gone Girl are somewhat inevitable. Unlike Gone Girl, in which horrible people do horrible things to each other, The Girl on The Train has a few more subtleties about behaviour, expectations, and relationships. The characters are perhaps bit more relatable, although they still make plenty enough bad decisions to make for an engrossing thriller. "
1160,Kerry *Soulcaster*,"*4.5 stars*I can see why some readers have compared The Girl On The Train with Gone Girl - they are both intense, gripping psychological thrillers that are hard to put down. Best of all, the characters are flawed, ranging from downright pathetic to sociopathic. *WARNING* If you're the type of reader who needs to find someone to cheer for, then you're going to be extremely disappointed. On the other hand, if you're anything like me, you're going to be sporting an evil little grin throughout the entire story."
1161,Staci,Psychological thriller that reminded me a bit of Rear Window. The author had me turning pages to find out what would happen next.Some foul language.
1162,Jenny Prefontaine,"I actually enjoyed this book. Kept me guessing for a bit. Couldn't put it down, even though it isn't a particularly fantastic book to be discussed for decades on end, there is something about it that really begins to grow on you. The characters are not ones I liked or could even relate to that much, but somehow that was intriguing to me. They drew me in slowly, especially Rachel's character who was by far the most compelling & repulsive at the same time. The chacracters also evolved, or more accurately, the descriptions of their actions, their personalities and their lives in general were akin to peeling away layers of an onion. Excellent storytelling on Hawkins part. I especially enjoyed Rachel's willing perception of truth; the fact that, even though her life was in shambles and even chaos for the most part, she looked at each event occurring in her life with rationality, with a lot of thought and open-mindedness. The hype of a book can certainly skew one's opinions/pre-conceived notions. I don't have TV, I am not a part of any circle of friends who discuss books regularly and being a single mom of 3 kids, barely have time to ""research"" books let along read them. Just picked it off the shelf, began to read, and enjoyed immensely. I've noticed I have also really been into English women writer's fiction mystery/thriller/detective books as well, at least at the moment. Can't wait for the next one. If anyone has a suggestion, please pipe in and let me know! :) "
1163,Don,"Overall, I enjoyed reading this book. I agree with those who say they felt the book bogged down a bit in the middle. The ending was not a complete shocker, but still I found it satisfying. I found the characters to be believable in a tragic sort of way. It left me feeling sad for all the brokenness in our world. "
1164,Kelli,"It took me all of about five hours to finish this book. A good, quick read."
1165,Doc,"Not sure if intended by author, but the book is loaded with run-on sentences. The book reads like a journal, so maybe the choppiness of it all goes with that theme. Good story with delayed buildup, but the ending kind of disappointed. Maybe it's just me; I was disappointed the book ended. Anyways, the theme these days goes along with titling chapters by the names of characters in the story, then writing from that character's perspective. Interesting. Is the ""narrator"" disappearing, being dissolved into the characters themselves? "
1166,Laura Jelenkovich,"Un buon libro, non il capolavoro che un buon marketing ha dipinto, ma un thriller con una struttura interessante. Praticamente a metà però si capisce chi è l'assassino e questo toglie pathos, ma resta la curiosità di vedere come si svilupperà il personaggio di Rachel. Unica nota che mi fa storcere un po' il naso e' che tutti i protagonisti parlano allo stesso modo. Se all'inizio del capitolo non ci fosse scritto di chi si tratta si potrebbero tranquillamente confondere megan, Anna ed alle volte perfino scott. Ma una lettura piacevole "
1167,exncgal,"I had such high hopes for this book based on the reviews and buzz it got online. Well, I did enjoy it, but I don't think it was all that and a bag of chips. The stories - because there were multiple intertwined stories here, not a single narrative - were well-written, although it took me a bit of time to realize that all the narrators were unreliable! And I found myself cringing each time Rachel took another drink, or Anna worried about Rachel bothering her and her family, or Megan got all cuckoo. So, we have three unreliable narrators - who were also unlikable. I'd give this a solid 3.5 stars, because it was well-written (and I did like the ending)."
1168,Trang  Tran (Bookidote),"I was hesitant in giving a review of this book because I don't know how to rate this book in the first place. it has the mystery vibe, but it reminded of Gone Girl, it's not a bad thing, but this one reminded me TOO much of Gone Girl which it wasn't that surprising anymore and kind of annoying for me since I just read Gone Girl before this book LOL.The main characters in this book are exactly and almost identical to the ones in Gone Girl , same motive, same pattern. It stil has a nice plot, I love the psychology side behind it. In opposite to most reviews, the character's complexity and bad sides are what I love the book actually. No one is perfect. Everybody has its flaws and its humanity at its rawest. Love the ending even if I knew who the ''villain'' ( like a lot of people did) was since the beginning but I still love the execution :) P.S : Full review to come soon on my blog ;) Trang- Book Bloggerhttp://bookidote.wordpress.com"
1169,Kelly,"While I did not particularly like any of these characters, I really wanted to know what happened. The suspense kept me listening. "
1170,Lisa,"The three narrators in the book are not fully reliable, so you're never quite sure how to take their interpretation of events. This makes for a fun, quick read, because I was always curious to read on to see how their perspectives would intertwine to reveal the full picture. "
1171,Sophie,"Wow, this book is an absorbing thriller that I gobbled in just a few bites. I know people are comparing it to Gone Girl, but I can't say it particularly reminded me of it. I think this novel stands on its own. I loved the way the story unfolded and how the author presented it from such varying points of view. I loved how my understanding of the characters changed as the story went on and how I rooted for Rachel even as she repeatedly disappointed me. It's been a long time since I found a book that held my attention the way this one did. Very well done. "
1172,Joey the J in R.J. Spindle,"RachelSo, I'm going into this book knowing nothing other than all of social media recommends it, and everyone seems to be reading it. I wonder if this is a product of the machine, or a genuinely good read. Based on this first section, I am undecided/leaning toward liking it. Rachel people watches in a similar way that I do. I don't name people, but I always fill in their lives like this. Seems one of the big themes of the story will be alcoholism ... at least as far as Rachel goes. There are three ladies who tell this story. The next lady starts her story one year prior to Rachel's. I wonder how this is going to come together.MeganOh, I like this. Megan is ""Jess"" the woman half of the perfect couple Rachel watches from the train. I love that we get to see her actual life, which is completely different from how Rachel perceives it. Megan is restless in her life. She quits her menial job ... now she is free, but she's depressed. She's seeing a head-shrinker ... she likes him. Hrmmm ... where could this be going?RachelAh hah, so ... Rachel has more problems than we thought. She's a bit obsessive as well as an alcoholic ... and she's blacked out ... having done something she doesn't remember ... now she's hurt, and doesn't know how she got hurt ... and there are messages on her phone. There's another connection between Megan and Rachel ... unless I've imagined it. Anna. They both know her, but don't know each other. I wonder if they can help each other out somehow ... only one way to find out. MeganHrm ... so Megan's half of the story is constantly running a year prior to Rachel's ... which means we are seeing the results of what has come to pass in Megan's story through Rachel ... and only getting clarification through Megan's parts. These are a couple of desperate women ... I wonder if they're going to be able to help each other, or if this will constantly be a relationship at a distance ... once Megan may never find out about ... except, there's still the possibility of Anna connecting them.RachelRachel knows that Jess is Megan now ... because of the newspaper. Megan is missing. Hrm ... I'm still not sure what to think about this story yet, but one thing is for sure, I am hooked. I want to know. I care enough about these ladies to find out what's happening to them. I need to know. MeganMaybe Megan is just polyamourus? Seems like she's struggling more than just that though. RachelThis is the chapter where everything clicked into place for me as to what this story is about. Nothing about the ending in sight yet, but ... could Rachel actually HAVE been the one to cause Megan's disappearance? She was blacked out for that period. She HAD been on the street at the time of the disappearance. She was disturbed by whatever she'd done at her ex's place ... a marriage she is CLEARLY in denial is over ... and Anne ... turns out, Anna is her husband's new wife. Megan was sitting their child in the beginning of the story. Is it really coincidence that the couple Rachel fantasized about was unknown to her before Megan's disappearance? I guess it is. They moved in after the divorce ... it's sad about Rachel not being able to have children. Then she fell apart. And her husband forgot about the ""for worse"" part of their marriage ... which is an unfair assessment, having not heard his side of things. Still ... I feel like Rachel needs help more than anything else. She's reaching out, and she's been laughed at ... *rolls eyes* the cops. What jerks. I'm officially committed to this book. I can see why it is so popular. That slow focus on the story was neat, if slightly confusing. Putting me off tilt really helped me get into Rachel's world ... and Megan's delayed responses to everything Rachel is going through is interesting ... that's why I'm afraid we're going to see Rachel involved in all this some how ... just as the police suggested.MeganMegan's little chapter here doesn't make me feel any better about Rachel's involvement. The fact that there is no hint about it at all feels like a big hint to me. If I am right, Hawkins will be showing us all the things around Megan ... and maybe that night Megan WAS going to ""escape"" her life ... then she was in the wrong place at the wrong time ... came across Rachel and ... well, that serrated mark on Rachel's forehead had to come from somewhere. RachelThis chapter didn't help either. I feel like ... now that Hawkins dropped that hint, she's going to do her damnedest to stay away from that idea ... because that's the answer. I can feel it. I don't want the answer to be right ... but I'm not sure if what satisfactory ending could come of this story if she didn't. I wonder if we'll know before we find a body? I have SO much sympathy for Rachel ... which is why I am sad that I am SURE she is the reason Megan is missing. I mean ... if Rachel did kill Megan thinking it was Anna ... that would make everything make sense. AnnaAfter this, I am feeling even more like Rachel did it. Anna saw her on the street. Of course, we still haven't seen the exchange Rachel has with THEM, but ... we're seeing all the evidence. *biggest frown ever* I must also note, though I am sad for Rachel, I am thoroughly enjoying this story. RachelWh-what? What just happened? Someone was arrested ... presumably, the man Megan is having the affair with ... and Scott?? has pulled Rachel into the house? Did she actually go to Scott's? What is happening? MeganIs Scott hitting Megan? Is it a sexual thing? I feel like I missed something ... and the affair ISN'T with the psychologist? Then who? You know ... for awhile, I pondered ""what if Megan and Tom ..."" I mean, it would make sense. Tom cheated before. That's how Anna came into the picture in the first place. There is more going on here ... hrmmmm. RachelJaysus, and Anna is there. I think Hawkins pulled a one-two with Scott pulling Rachel into the house. He's not violent. It's not him ... I almost want to start the book over right now to see what I've missed. I really feel like I've not got some essential information yet. I wonder if that's because I stopped reading to sleep ... hrm.AnnaHRMMMMMM. Rachel is looking pretty villainous ... too villainous. Have I been duped? Was I supposed to be suspecting Rachel all along? I still feel like Tom might be more involved than I've considered. I don't blame Anna for feeling how she feels about Rachel. Must keep reading.RachelWhy are you doing this, Rachel? You're doing this, because ... I think you subconsciously know you killed her. You know it. You haven't forgotten it. It's hiding behind the alcohol. You. Did. It. I remembered what I forgot. Megan was having an affair with the therapist ... or so we thought. We've seen him resist her ... and we've seen them kiss through Rachel's eyes. I bet that kiss wasn't as romantic as Rachel thinks it was. I might be pulling Tom's involvement out of my ass ... there's still something about the whole Scott thing I don't understand. He doesn't seem the abusive type. MeganOkay, wait ... Megan had a baby ... and she maybe, accidentally on purpose drowned the baby? I'm not sure this is the kind of book I should read in more than one sitting. Even reading back through my notes, I feel like I've missed something here again. HRM?!RachelI can't stop to say anything more. I don't have anything to add. I need to keep going and see where this leads.AnnaDitto.RachelAnna DID kill her baby. At least the tabloid confirmed the scene from earlier. I can't stop for long ... still think Rachel did it. AnnaReading on...RachelKept reading ... MeganI am no longer at work reading this … now I’m at home … I was going to wait until tomorrow to finish reading this, but I have to know … and I don’t think I’ll be able to stop again until I’ve reached the end. The Rest of the BookI was right about Tom having an affair with Megan. I was wrong about it being Rachel, and I am pretty sure that little hint in the beginning about it might be Rachel was purposeful. It was there for people like me. People who don't stay in the moment of a story and try to figure it out as they read it. It was so slight, that it's seeming un-importance made it important. Turned out it was a crime of passion, and Tom was the killer. Tom almost kills Rachel as well. The end brought this five star book down to four stars. Not because it turned out to be Tom, I like that I was duped. But ... we didn't get to see the big climactic confrontation. We get all the build up. All the words. Tom beats Rachel and Anna seems to be going along with Tom's plan ... then it cuts away to after the fact, and we get to hear about rather than see how it all turns out. Tom's death. MEH! If there is one thing I hate is going through all the build-up for nothing. At the end of the day, this was a really good book. Probably not one I'll read again, and the style did take an adjustment on my part in the first few chapters, but it was very much worth the read. I'd recommend it to anyone who reads as much as I do.

1173,Marcus Uhre,"4,5 stjerneJa, der er vel en grund til postyret.En ægte thriller med kuldegysninger ad libitum. Lidt forudsigelig, men er det er okay, den fungerer som den skal. "
1174,Sydney Allen,"So, everyone was right. If you enjoyed ""Gone Girl,"" I'm almost certain you will enjoy ""The Girl on the Train."" The difference is... ""Gone Girl"" blindsided me with the plot twists, while I figured out the mysteries in ""The Girl on the Train"" pretty early on. However, this did not keep me from enjoying the book.Although she is quite broken and unstable, my favorite narrator in this story is Rachel. She is a raging alcoholic that blacks out frequently. I enjoyed how frustrated I became right along with Rachel when she couldn't remember certain events. She is depicted as chubby, sloppy, and drunk, but you can't help but root for her. The other two female narrators were less likable for me. I suppose I like my characters a bit more flawed.I can't say much without spoiling the plot, but ""The Girl on the Train"" truly was an entertaining read. I read it quickly and never got bored. I'm keeping my fingers crossed for a movie!"
1175,Angelika,"Rachel fährt jeden Morgen und Abend mit der selben Bahn quer durch London. Dabei kommt sie immer an dem Viertel vorbei, indem sie bis vor zwei Jahren selber gewohnt hat. Die Bahn hält fast immer zur selben Seit an einem bestimmten Signal. Fast jeden Tag beobachtet Rachel an dieser Stelle ein junges Pärchen in ihrem Haus. Die beiden sind so glücklich zusammen, einfach das perfekte Paar. Sie erinnern Rachel an ihr früheres Leben mit Tom, ihrem Ex-Mann, als sie noch zusammen mit ihm in dem Viertel wohnte. Nur ein paar Türen von “Jess und Jason” – so nennt sie das Paar – entfernt. Tom wohnt immer noch dort. Zusammen mit Anna, seiner neuen Frau, und ihrem gemeinsamen Baby. Anna hat jetzt alles was sich Rachel mit Tom gewünscht hat, aber es hat nicht sollen sein. Rachel fühlt sich in der Menschenmenge unsichtbar, doch selber sieht und beobachtet sie alles. Eines Tages macht fällt ihr im Garten von “Jess und Jason” etwas Ungeheuerliches auf und sie weiß, dass sie handeln muss…..Die Story selber ist recht unspektakulär, Spannung bekommt sie durch die gute Erzählart. Rachels Sicht hat etwas Voyeuristisches durch ihr Beobachten. Rachel hat ein schweres Alkoholproblem, das mit ihrer Vergangenheit zusammen hängt. Das ist aber nicht gleich von vornherein klar. Das etwas mit ihrer Psyche nicht in Ordnung ist, merkt man aber doch bald. Die Stimmung ist sehr gedrückt. Als Person tat mir Rachel schon leid. Ich hoffte immer wieder, dass sie den Absprung vom Alkohol endlich schafft. Neben Rachel wird die Geschichte auch noch aus Annas und Megans Sicht erzählt. Den Sprüngen zwischen den Handlungen kann man als Leser sehr gut folgen. Immer tiefer wird man in das Leben der drei Frauen und ihrer Männer hineingezogen. Durch die Alkoholsucht der Hauptfigur hat die Geschichte etwas Düsteres und Deprimierendes an sich, denn Rachel kann sich an entscheidende Ereignisse nicht erinnern. Das mach die Handlung aber aus, denn als Leser will und muss man natürlich wissen, was sich abspielte und welche Auflösung die Autorin am Ende diesbezüglich parat hat. Selber war ich ziemlich lange auf verschiedenen Lösungspfaden unterwegs. Das hat mir gut gefallen, denn es gibt nichts Deprimierenderes an einem Thriller, als wenn man die Auflösung schon sehr früh erahnt oder weiß. Paula Hawkins hat das in ihrem Debütroman sehr gut gelöst. Die Figuren neben Rachel waren eher platt und oberflächlich, bildeten aber einen guten Kontrast zu Rachel. Die am Leben gescheiterte Alkoholikerin auf der einen Seite, die schönen und erfolgreichen auf der anderen Seite.Mein Fazit:Die Englische Ausgabe ließt sich sehr gut. Die Wortwahl ist nicht zu ausgefallen und man kann der Handlung auch mit nur Fortgeschrittenen Englischkenntnissen gut folgen. Die Handlung selber ist überschaubar. Rachel handelt oft spontan und unüberlegt, passend zu ihrer Sucht. Überraschungen gibt es nur zum Schluss der Handlung hin. Die Geschichte lebt eindeutig durch das gescheiterte Leben von Rachel. Alles in allem ganz gut gemacht und ein solider Erstlingsroman."
1176,Lacaparouja,"Ero quasi spaventata dai pareri contrastanti riguardo questo romanzo, ma mi sono trovata davanti ad un libro appassionante ed estremamente coinvolgente. L'ho letto in meno di 24 ore, forse, a dire la verità, presa anche dall'ansia - perché, preparatevi, ne proverete molta -, totalmente travolta dalla storia e dalle vicende. Un buon esordio per questa scrittrice, un thriller che intriga e confonde il lettore. - ho sempre avuto il dubbio fino a metà, poi mi sono definitivamente orientata verso la soluzione, ma vi assicuro che la scrittrice ha una grande capacità di deviare il lettore e di mescolargli le idee in testa! "
1177,Зузу,"Rachel, a divorced alcoholic, gets the same train every morning and every evening. On her commute to and fro London the train stops at the same signal every time. This is where she gets to imagine the lives of the people who live next to the train track, that is until the day she sees something. She's not sure what she saw, as she has frequent blackouts, but she knows she saw something. Will Rachel remember what she saw before it's too late?The book was quite well written and easy to get into psychological thriller. The story is told by three female narratives - a divorced alcoholic, a pretentious mistress-come-wife and a cheat, who can you trust? There was two things that linked these three women together, they were all as unreliable as each other and a man. It was easy to spot who the antagonist was fairly quickly but I didn't find that this in any way took away from the reading experience. The author threw in plenty of red herrings to throw you off of the scent.The characters were quite unlikeable but I think that's what they were intended to be. Rachel, the alcoholic, the girl on the train, makes you feel many feelings towards her - pity, doubt, frustration, sadness, digest, compassion. This isn't a common thing in books, to feel so many emotions towards one, single, character. I found myself liking Scott an awful lot even though he was mercurial - totally understandable. At one point I did get slightly confused. At one point during Rachel's narative it's evening and then straight after during the same event it's morning with Anna's narrative. Then there was the time where Rachel was told to go over the following evening but the date never changes. It by no means ruined the story but it's usually the small things that make up the big things.I wasn't digging the multiple time periods, well two, but I can understand why it was done - to give a bit of back story. I found it quite annoying and tedious to begin with but come halfway and the dates were getting closer it was easy to see how they intertwined and piece together.This is definitely a thriller that will keep you wanting to turn the pages, even if the ending did fall a bit flat - it wasn't a very satisfying ending. The author had a fantastic ability of writing a story bound to a short list of characters but being able to make none of them above suspicion. All of the characters at one point thoughout the book was deemed a suspect for what happened, well all of them apart from Anna's little girl. Am I seriously the only person who read this before ""
Gone Girl

1178,Michele H,Unique textual structure. Not in love with some elements of the novel but really enjoyed reading the book.
1179,Elaine,"I bought The Girl on the Train because it boasted to be an Alfred Hitchcock style, engrossing thriller. I’m happy to say that all that boasting was definitely well earned! The Girl on the Train had me on the edge of my seat and turning pages like crazy throughout the book! I was totally absorbed and found it very difficult to put down.Rachel Watson is the girl on the train and the main narrator of this mystery. Rachel rides the 8:04 slow train from Ashbury to Euston every day. Every day the train makes the same signal stop and every day Rachel watches the same couple on their patio through the train window. She starts to fantasize about them. She even gives them names: Jess and Jason. They are the happy couple that she and her husband Tom used to be before it all went bad. And now something terrible has happened to Jess and Jason a.k.a. Megan and Scott and Rachel's life comes crashing down on her.The Girl on the Train is Paula Hawkins' first attempt at a crime novel. All I can say to you Paula is great job!! I'm giving you four stars.Fun Fact:Paula Hawkins, is a former financial journalist, who has written a couple of other books under a pseudonym."
1180,Elizabeth Bober,"I picked this book up mostly to see what all the fuss was about. Suddenly all of my friends on GoodReads were reading it. I can see why. This is a fun thriller with 3 narrators and one very unreliable protagonist delving into the disappearance of a local woman. The narrators are in turns complex, frustrating and relatable and I wanted all of them to get their acts together. You'll probably enjoy this if you liked Gone Girl but wish it hadn't left you feeling quite so bereft about humanity. "
1181,Nikka,I honestly didn't expect to like it as much as I do now! Brilliant! 
1182,Katie Winkler,"At first it reminded me of Gone Girl, and it does have a similar feel, but it ultimately has a different focus. It's very much about women and the way they sometimes hurt and use each other for the sake of men who don't deserve them. The protagonist, Rachel, was not very likable at first, but she grew on me. In fact, I liked the fact that she was deeply flawed--an alcoholic, overweight, obsessive--she isn't your typical protagonist, not even your typical anti-hero, but I could relate to her in ways that I can't usually. I can see myself being like her if I didn't have what I'm so blessed to have I guess. "
1183,Rachelle Villar,"It was such a long, long time that I have read a book which I could simply not put down. This was very thrilling, yes. It's like hoping that the answer lies at the next page, or on the next, until you find yourself hanging on to the last few pages, where it finally shows up. It was a good book, well written, but I can't seem to shake off the darkness of the story. I liked this book very much, but will not revisit it again, no matter how many the questions are in my head."
1184,Hanako,"Writing-3Story-4.5Enjoyment-4 Hawkins creates a dark mystery thriller in the same vein as ""Gone Girl."" The unreliable storyteller and changing the perspective between 3 different characters makes for an interesting trip through the tale. The writing is adequate, and does the job of telling the story clearly, but isn't dreamy or poetic like some novels I enjoy. The writing style works for the story though. Hawkins has a pretty good bead on what makes her characters tick, and they felt real and solid to me. Their actions and reactions seemed reasonable, or at least understandable and followed what I understand of human nature. Some thoughtful red herrings had me guessing until about 65% through the book, though I'm sure some more astute folks would know exactly what's going on even before any hints are dropped (I don't understand how readers can do that!!). Sometimes I wake up for a bit around 4 am, and will read for 15-30 minutes until I fall back asleep. This book had me up for at least 2 hours trying to get to the bottom of the mystery. People who enjoy mysteries and psychology or crime thrillers may want to give this a try. "
1185,Nikki,I was surprised by how much I disliked the protagonist and how angry I was at her for her decision making. But I think that's why I liked the book. Elicited emotion. 
1186,Cristiana,"The book kept me glued to my Kindle, well-written and fast paced, it was a delightful read - and that is coming from someone not much of a thriller fan. I loved the three perspectives in the book, made it harder to pick a favorite character and even harder to judge the ones I didn't like. I also liked a lot the introspective passages, very lively described, real and down to Earth. A great story about the complexity of human nature and the secrets we all bury somewhere, sometime. "
1187,Hannah (fullybookedreviews),"I was lucky enough to meet the author at a book signing/interview, which was so awesome. But obviously that didn’t influence my review.I finished the book in one sitting, which is always one way to judge the strength of the book. I was sort of dumbfounded, however, reading through some of the reviews for this book – of the negative comments, two dominant strands of thought seemed to be 1)This book is the 50 shades of grey of the crime genre and 2) ERMAGERD the characters were so unlikeable how can anybody like this book what is society coming to MORAL FAILINGS!!111!!! As someone who doesn’t read a lot in the crime genre, not liking the gore part of it and also because I end up having vivid nightmares which do not a good sleep make, I can’t really judge on the first criticism. I do think we need to stop the line of thinking that anything popular is a sell-out to the genre, however.But the second criticism is what intrigued me. (Disclaimer: there is no correct way to review a book, this is no attack on other reviewers, etc) IMO, dislikable, unreliable characters usually make the book more interesting. Furthermore, it takes more than an unlikable character to rate a book negatively – yeah, they could be incredibly misogynistic, or kick puppies, or compulsively lie, but as long as they’re well fleshed-out, and there’s an interesting plot, and we get insight into their motivations, well, then, I’m satisfied. When did we start thinking that the characters have to be good and nice in order for the book to be good? Furthermore, the author said something really interesting in her interview – that we’re seeing directly into the character’s heads. It’s not being filtered through third person – we’re right in the thoughts of these characters. And, quite frankly, the human mind is not a great place to be for anybody. We all have dark thoughts, murderous fantasies, judgmental comments that never pass our lips – hell, if we had to be judged solely on the contents of our heads, we’d all be in nice padded cells by now. It’s actions and words that we should judge the characters by.Another factor mentioned, specifically with regards to our MC’s unlikeable nature, is the fact that she is an alcoholic. And alcoholism is not a pretty disease. It’s not a grandfatherly figure snoring in front of the fireplace after one too many whiskeys. It’s an ugly illness that takes away your dignity, self-respect, and usually friendships/families/careers. There is no glamour in it, and I think the author really got this down in terms of the portrayal. In terms of the book itself, I did find the beginning rather slow, but things started moving along fairly swiftly once I got a few chapters in. Personally, I was fascinated by the slow unraveling of these women’s lives. It really showed the ugly side of domestic life and human nature – and questions of how well you can ever really know your partner. I called the perpetrator around halfway through the novel – so chuffed I was right, haha – but I see quite a few people guessed it! I have lost control over everything, even the places in my head. Overall, this book was a win for me. An intriguing premise, and an unflinching look at the dark side of our domestic lives, and indeed, the human mind. "
1188,Roxanne,"3.5 stars. I liked this book. I loved how the narrators, especially Rachel, were so unreliable and I never really knew what to believe. I was wrapped right up in it all until today, when I read the last thirty or so pages. Something about the ending just... I don't know. Maybe it was a bit over dramatic? I don't want to give anything away so I'll leave it at that. Still, a fun read for me, and I would like to read more by this author."
1189,Vee Charles,"Update:So it's a few months later and this book is still on my brain. Now that the smoke has cleared I have to admit that this is one of the best books I've read this year.I will be reading this book again very soon.Original Review:Like most people I purchased this book because of all the positive reviews it has been receiving. Although I liked the story, I didn't lose myself in it as I do with other books.There was a very gray, depressing vibe with this story and the characters which I thought was very interesting. It was almost as though everyone was a victim so you didn't know who to hate whereas in most stories there is always that one character you loath (even if in the end they're innocent...haha).At times the writing reminded me of Elizabeth Haynes' style as well as some of the events in the novel (not very original). I guess with all the hype about this book I was a bit disappointed that I wasn't as into it as I had hoped. Well, on to the next! Haha!"
1190,Leia,"Started off slowly, picked up shortly and ended well. I don't want to be friends with anyone in this book. "
1191,Rae,"This book is narrated by three amazing female protagonists who each have their own voice and personality. And fellow feminists, if that's not enough to grab you, be assured that the male characters in this novel who are revealed to be abusive, controlling and/or gaslighting pieces of trash (though 'not all men!') get what they deserve in the end. This book was a well-crafted thriller with a good dose of misandry and I enjoyed it very much.I want to start giving a trigger warning for books because I think that needs to be done more often. So for this one, a TW for: abuse, alcoholism, domestic violence, gaslighting, death.I read this book for the 2015 Popsugar Reading Challenge - 'a mystery or thriller'."
1192,Tomas,Great page turner and a good mystery in how it had you guessing the whole time.
1193,Nichole,I REALLY loved this book! I serve in Salt Lake City once a week as a service missionary/volunteer at the LDS (Mormon) Conference Center once a week (originally 4 days) but I used to ride the uta front-runner train once a week and so I would also read this book on my kindle on the train going into SL and leaving on the way home. And it was even more fun that way too. I hadn't read Gone Girl at the time but had been on my list so I decided to try this and ended up loving it more than I thought I would. I did later read Gone Girl and honestly I HATED it! But Girl on the Train was soooooooo much better and definitely kept me at the edge of my seat and made train rides even more fun when I got a chance to read it on there. And that end holy crapanoli I did NOT see that coming! Very intense and very well written. I ended up ordering a hard copy of this book so I can get other people hooked and now I'm REALLY excited that it's done so well there's going to be a movie on it! So I'm even more excited to watch it and the amazing and talented Emily Blunt playing the main character! 
1194,Robert Collins,"This is a twist on the amateur detective genre with the person trying to make sense of it all is an alcoholic who has frequent blackouts. This affects her interaction with all the people who she comes in contact with. Rachel travels by train into London each day and during these trips the train stops or slows near a group of houses that back onto the rail line. Rachel creates stories about the people she sees in these houses and back yards. When a woman goes missing from the very house Rachel has fixated on, her initial reaction to what she saw that day is coloured by her drinking. Did it happen or did she imagine it, what does it mean? The chapters are told from the perspective of the key protagonists in the mystery. You need to pay attention to this early another wise you will be extremely confused as to whose point of view you are witnessing.There are twists and turns as your opinion of who did it changes with each new revelation. Thoroughly enjoyable book."
1195,Marci,"Every character in this story is ****** crazy. Yet, I had to keep reading. An interesting opening with a passenger making up stories about the people she sees they the window of the train, but then there is a murder and it all gets complicated. Twists and turns, a good mystery"
1196,Lizzie,"A very entertaining listen. All three narrators did a great job of shifting emotion, creating suspense and fleshing out their character's complexity. The ""BBC voice"" was particularly well done. It got to be a bit long towards the end but maybe I just wanted the narrators' agony to end."
1197,Alicia Gard,"Loved this mystery and especially loved the alternating chapters from each woman's pov. I did not predict the ending, and I always love when an author is able to surprise me :-)"
1198,Stefan,"There have been lots of comparisons to Gone Girl, but not having read it I can't comment on the comparison. What I can say is that this book consumed me from the minute I started. The drive to finish it was two fold, one was to find out who did it and the other was to make this ""train ride"" end. I don't mean I didn't like this book, I really enjoyed but, but it made me very uncomfortable, which is what a good author does, they push us outside our comfort zone. "
1199,JM S,"That was creepy ...... Just read it the book sinks you in from the first page . It's a good one time read .Fast paced , creepy psychological thriller by Paula Hawkins you will not be able to hate or love any character it's a very rear thing . At times I was disgusted with the protagonist . It's a one of a kind novel no one is happy or even close to it ... They all are trying to find happiness not realising they already have it . If they just concentrate on their home love the people around them love their , love themselves ... And please don't compare it to the gone girl . Spoilers  when Anna touches Rachel in police station and say you take care of yourself I felt that was the most creepy part the novel it gives reader a feeling that everything is not alright things can still go wrong .....What makes this novel great is the apt portrayal of psychological behaviours of character .You think you know people around you , your relatives , neighbours , YOUR PARTNER . You never know"
1200,Caitlin Gutilla,"This was a great read. Fast-paced, intriguing, with an interesting cast of unreliable characters who are all messed up in their own special ways. I don't read many mystery stories, but I recommend this novel to any who wants to take a step into the genre. You'll probably be ripping your hair out at some of the awful decisions and mannerisms of these characters, AS I WAS MOST OF THE TIME, but these intricacies are what really make the story feel real. Highly recommend!"
1201,Abby Murphy,"man, i wish we could give half stars. This would be 4.5 for sure.There was a lot of hype around this book. I waited on a waiting list at the library for several months before I had the chance to read it. It did not disappoint. This story is fast paced and keeps you guessing. I don't like to give many details because I don't like to spoil the story. But if you are into murder mysteries, you'll love this. :)"
1202,Gill's Great Book Escapes,"Stunningly clever thriller! 
What is different about this book:
 This novel evolves through the eyes of different people who each have their own view of life and events. Each person telling their own story, laying bare their lives to be absorbed by the reader. How then can the truth be pieced together when the facts are fragmented and damaged? A brilliant way to read a tense thriller without being told of the plot and I was left guessing right up until the end.It starts with Rachel on a commute to London. Personally for me train a journey is like being in another place and time, and reading this I felt like I was on a train remembering my days of travelling to work with the same people every day:
I just want to lean back in the soft, sagging velour seat, feel the warmth of the sunshine streaming through the window, feel the carriage rock back and forth and back and forth, the comforting rhythm of wheels on tracks.
Rachel describes her train journeys with such intimacy that I was drawn into her life and travelling with her. This was not just a commute for her it was a journey through her miserable life with a destination still unknown.She routinely watches out of the window, especially at the row of Victorian houses where she sees Jess and Jason on the patio in the mornings having coffee. Of course that is not their names, she has built them a fantasy life in her head.
I can see Jason and Jess this morning, and my sense of disappointment is acute. Silly I know. I scrutinise the house, but there's nothing to see.
She is creating a fantasy relationship in her head but the line between reality is blurring.A few doors away she sees Anna - who is real and is now married to her ex husband and living in her house. They have the baby she never had. When Rachel describes the time she knew her husband was cheating on her, Hawkins uses such a beautifully put line:
Sometimes its a text or a voicemail message; in my case it was an email, the modern-day lipstick on the collar.
Oh, I could go on waxing lyrical about the life of Megan and Anna too, but I would would not want to spoil the book for you, let me just say, their lives are equally as interesting as Rachels and very pertinent to the plot.The disappearance of Megan starts Rachel hurtling towards self destruction as she tries to find out what happened manipulating her need for attention, recognition, self worth, and maybe something else. As reality and fantasy become confused Rachel knows she has important information that could solve what has happened to Megan. She draws you into this journey with her, with the fear that it is not going to end well.Throughout the book Paula Hawkins gives an insight into alcoholism and its effects on oneself and others. This felt so real it was a warning, I have met Rachel,, seen her in the pub, and avoided her on the street.This is a tense thriller, at a pace which echoes the commute of the train, with imagined scenes from the window with the stops at the lights. I loved each and every character; Rachel got my sympathy and my cringing annoyance - come on pull yourself together girl!  Jess; who would have thought she was as complex as that, and her secret - wow thats deep! I wanted to dislike Anna, because she broke up Rachel and Tom's marriage, but you know that she is not that nasty. I enjoyed how the characters of the men were real even the strangers; someone speaks to you, they are in your head somewhere, but you can't quite place them and you are not sure whether you are afraid of them.Listen to this line, absolutely the best quote of the book for me:
LIFE IS NOT A PARAGRAPH AND DEATH IS NO PARENTHESIS.
I recommend it to everyone who loves a different psychological thriller.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Many thanks to the Publisher for an ARC via NetGalley in return for an honest opinion."

1205,Molly Dettmann,I couldn't put this book down. It definitely lived up to all the hype. 
1206,Jennefer,"I am truly struggling with writing this review on The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins. I don’t know how to put in words what I am actually feeling. On one hand, I think I absolutely loved this mystery because it was a great suspense story and a page turner. I truly couldn’t put the book down. I read it quickly because I just had to know what was actually going on. However, that being said, what I didn’t like was the tediousness of it all, I felt as though we were going over the same thing again and again. Also the characters were completely depressing, odd, and just didn’t appeal much to me from the get go. Every single character in this novel is a complete hot mess! All in all it was an entertaining read and great suspense story. The premise of the novel involves a train that the main character Rachel rides to London each day. Rachel is a drunk and lost her job months back but doesn’t want her flat mate to know this particular fact so Rachel continues to ride the train daily. This train takes her past her old neighborhood which includes the house that her Ex husband Tom, and family still live in. From the window of the train, Rachel observes not only her old garden that backs up to the tracks, but also the daily activities of another couple who live just down the street from her previous home. In her imagination she has given this couple made up names and has created a complete fairy tale love life for them since she dreams of this for herself one day. Real life, however, cannot live up to her fantasy and the couple does not have the picture perfect relationship that Rachel has conjured up. When a murder occurs, Rachel becomes entangled in the investigation because of what she has witnessed on her daily commute on the train. The Girl on the Train is a dark, haunting and very depressing psychological thriller. This rather gloomy tale is told with intersecting timelines from the viewpoint of three different women Rachel, Anne and Megan. All of these women are unreliable narrators with something to hide which makes for an interesting mystery to say the least. In fact, most of the characters in this novel, including the men, lack authenticity and like I mentioned earlier every character is a hot mess with skeletons in their closets to boot. I truly don’t want to continue to give you any more information in regards to the plot. I don’t want to spoil it for you so let me just end with this thought, I never saw the ending coming and due to the twists and turns the reader will be drawn in to this novel easily. As always … happy reading my friends :) "
1207,Rosalind Minett,"This psychological thriller has had tremendous coverage and praise. I was totally immersed in the reading for over half the book. The main character with all her problems and back story is so well portrayed, little by compelling little. She’s a good example of someone readers can identify sympathetically with whilst at the same time feeling some revulsion. The plotline unfolds gradually, more characters emerging and showing their true colours. It was as we approached the denouement that I became disappointed. It was much like a convention Agatha Christie structure at that point, the clever detective revealing all the steps in the crime and its hiding - except that we had to believe a baddie would give away all the secrets. No. Not in character. I had this same disappointment with Gone Girl. All went well and compellingly until a last turn of the screw forced my suspense of belief to come crashing down. Once the events,dialogue or interchange can no longer convince in terms of the character so carefully built up during the earlier chapters, the reader is lost as a champion. At least, this one is."
1208,Paul Pessolano,"“The Girl on the Train” by Paula Hawkins, published by Riverhead Books.Category – Mystery/Thriller Publication Date – January 13, 2015If you are looking for something totally different in the mystery/thriller category “The Girl on the Train” should do it for you. A psychological thriller that is narrated by 3 young women, all of whom need some kind of help. Rachel is “The Girl on the Train”, she is unemployed, she has been through a failed marriage, and is an alcoholic. She takes the train into London everyday to keep people from knowing she has been fired from her job. The train passes the same set of row houses every day and Rachel sees something that will set a series of unfortunate events into motion.The three women, Rachel, Megan, and Anna become involved in each others lives, largely due to their relationship with Rachel’s former husband Tom who is now married to Anna. Megan who lives down the street has a secret she has been keeping for years and becomes involved when she agrees to help Anna with her baby.The story becomes even more convoluted when Anna starts seeing Dr. Kamal, a psychiatrist. This leads to more confusion as he becomes the focal point in a possible murder.Although the reader must pay strict attention to each chapter and which girl is the chapter referring to, and also some slow periods in the narration, “The Girl on the Train” is a definitely must read as it keeps the reader intrigued throughout the book as it twists and turns to its conclusion. "
1209,Kimball,"The ending of the book was enough to push this up to 4 stars otherwise I would have given it 3. I mostly pitied/felt shame for Rachel then pity left me and all I felt was sadness or some other unknown emotion that I can't describe. The different time stamps lost me and some parts were boring/insignificant/could-have been-shorter but all-in-all it was a good book. I love the different time stamps in a book that make you connect the dots, especially after you've read it and know the whole story then you can piece together which characters were doing what at certain times. Hence I would need to reread this at some point in the future. Or be lazy and wait for the movie to come out in October.What happened to Scott at the end? I'm confused. He seems to have disappeared.I'm glad I read this because it helps me not to be so naive about evil people existing in the real world....And on that note, my next book to read is My Story, I got a feeling I'm going to be paranoid for a while."
1210,Sergiu Pobereznic,"It wasn't quite what I expected from hype, but it didn't disappoint.This is a story about three women that cross paths, with tragic consequences, told through each of their POV.It's a typical thriller and Yes, I worked out the 'who done it' well before the end. However, it moved at a good pace and the author maintained interest for me, the reader.Some readers have complained about not being able to distinguish clearly between the three women. If I am completely honest, I agree, but I stayed on track because I read carefully. Had my concentration lapsed there would have been issues, I believe. Perhaps the three women were too alike and needed more differing character traits to set them apart.As for many reviewers complaining that the characters were not likeable. Nice people are nice, but flawed people are more interesting. Protagonists do not have to be likeable, at least not for me. I don't need to read about some ideal individual. Overall, it was a good read and better than Gone Girl, which everyone seems to compare it to. Personally, I didn't much like Gone Girl.Sergiu Pobereznic (author)amazon.com/author/sergiupobereznic"
1211,Michael,"great plot twist! I picked up this book because it sounded like an interesting plot...a girl day dreaming about the lives of strangers witnesses something out of the ordinary and how her actions effected the lives of those people but also how her own life was intertwined. Very good story and if you use the whisper sync, the performance was well done. I particularly liked the different point of views of each of the main characters through out the story. "
1212,Trish at Between My Lines,"This review was originally posted on Between My LinesA few weeks ago I noticed a strange amount of oohhhing and aahhhing about this book.  And now I’ve read it, I get it!  It’s definitely one to ohh and ahh over!  *jumps over on to the bandwagon*First Line of The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins
""She is buried beneath a silver birch tree, down towards the old train tracks, her grave marked with a cairn.""My Thoughts on The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins
I gave this 4.5 stars so it’s a no brainer to figure out that I loved this twisty book.   I love psychological thrillers and I have VERY high standards for them.  So I’m happy to report that The Girl on the Train jumped the bar effortless for me!What I loved about The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins:
It’s mysterious.  I was a LONG time figuring out what was going on and just how the three main characters all fitted together.It’s familiar.  I loved the simple concept of a girl on the train making up stories in her head about a house she sees every day.  Of course it’s not that simple but that theme just really appealed to me as I’m always ridiculously nosey when I get glimpses into people's lives too.It’s intriguing.  Once you start, I’m sorry but you will probably be a goner until you’re finished it.  The way the book is set up is just really enticing and makes you want to read on just one more chapter to see just what is really going on.  And then one more....The characters are realistic and I was pulled head first into their knotty, complicated lives.  It’s not pretty, it’s not heart-warming but it is compulsive reading.  I love intense, dark characters and this book has those in abundance.The ending nailed it as a great read for me.  I loved the tone of it and it worked perfectly. 
    What I didn’t love about The Girl on the Train 
  
I got nothing.  I loved it all!I don’t rate it as high as I rated Gone Girl as I just didn’t admire the prose as much in this one.  It’s still fab but the language doesn’t dazzle me with cleverness the way Gone Girl did.  And I know I won’t remember it as long.Overall I thought this one was an absorbing read with fully fleshed out characters and I loved how mysterious and twisty it was. Who should read The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins?
I’d highly HIGHLY recommend this to fans of psychological thrillers especially if you like characters whose lives are full of shadows.  Fans of Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn,  Before I Sleep by S J Watson and The Secret Place by Tana French should also really enjoy this one.Thanks to  Random House UK and NetGalley for giving me a copy of this book in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.   "
1213,Kike,"Paula Hawkins nos entrega una de las mas interesantes novelas de misterio que he leído.Lo mas interesante es desarrollo y la estructura que para el lector sucede de la misma manera que para la protagonista casi a ciegas, sin saber que pasa, con trozos de información, sin saber bien hacia donde apuntan las sospechas y que la hace mas inquietante y provocativa.Contada con tres voces totalmente definidas, Hawkins nos va envolviendo poco a poco en este relato intrigante, que aunque al principio baja de nivel un poco, cierra de manera potente y magnifica."

1215,Bam,"#2015 Reading Challenge--week 10: a mystery or thriller.This page-turning psychological thriller is told from the perspective of three women (Rachel, Megan, and Anna) in alternating chapters and is quite the charcter study. Rachel is a divorced alcoholic who takes the train into London each day, pretending to go to a job from which she was fired months before. On its route, the train pauses briefly at the same spot and Rachel observes a young married couple on their terrace and fantasizes about their happy life together, so unlike her own. One day Rachel is shocked to see the woman kissing another man. How COULD she! A day or two later, Rachel reads a news report about a woman named Megan Hipwell who has disappeared and realizes from the photo that Megan is the woman she has been observing. Should she report what she has seen to the police?Just down the street from Megan lives Tom, Rachel's ex-husband, with his current wife, Anna, and their baby. They live in the house that Rachel and he shared during their marriage, much to Anna's displeasure. Worse, whenever Rachel is drunk, she harasses them with late-night phone calls and drop-bys, to the point that Anna wants to take out a restraining order against her. Their lives become increasingly tangled as the search for Megan intensifies while Rachel's life continues to spiral downward from her drinking problem. Figuring out the 'whodunit' isn't hard but this doesn't detract from the page-turning thrills. What a debut! Can't wait to read more from this writer. "
1216,Eri,"SPOILER ALERT!An enjoyable read!""There's something comforting about the sight of strangers safe at home"".From the train,Rachel sees a couple in one of the houses of her previous neighbourhood.She was married then,happily.In apartment number 15 she and Tom,her then husband were living a good life until she found out he was a cheater and that concluded their married life,previously hit by problems because of her not getting pregnant and wanting a child so much.But now,everyday from the train which takes her to work she sees what she and Tom could have been,a perfect couple;there's this comfort to her because she projects herself into Jess,the name she gives to the girl she sees.She's happy for them.But then one day Jess disappears and Rachel has an idea why.The day before she saw her with another man,kissing.She starts to hate her.How could she do that to Jason?I do believe the author describes perfectly what we could call empathy,she feels deluded that Jess cheated on Jason because she saw how she felt,how happy she was with Jason,she felt it herself,that eluding happiness.Apparently,seeing is not always believing.There's something more than what meets the eye.Rachel tells the police what she saw and an investigation begins trying to find out the missing girl.""One for sorrow,Two for joy,Three for a girl,Four for a boy,Five for silver,Six for gold,Seven for a secret,Never to be told.""SPOILER ALERT!Somewhere in the middle I made my guesses:1. Tom killed her,he cheated on Rachel,he could as well have cheated on Ana with Megs,the nanny girl.Typical.2. Ana killed her,she finds out about the affair and keeps silent until she finds the perfect timing to kill her.Then she might have planned to blame it on Rachel,the ex,alcoholic girl who couldn't even remember what she saw on the day of the crime. (But unfortunately the author doesn't go that dark,she keeps it simple).3.Rachel killed her,she felt envious of their happiness,she wanted to be Megs because she liked Scott(creepy).By choosing the first option the author decides to keep a more low profile for her characters,Ana and Rachel are normal people;Rachel abused by Tom,apparently she was lied about what she did when she was drunk a couple of times and Tom continuously treated her like nothing;Ana is the typical ""other girl"",she feels happy somebody left someone and married her because she apparently has some low self esteem issues going on.The darkest one is Megan,who also has an affair with her psychiatrist,lived with a man while still a teen and accidentally killed her baby.The author chooses to make Tom the killer,which is a predictable choice.Then in the end Ana and Rachel are accomplices,one calls the police and the other keeps quiet about the knife stabbing.I felt it missed the psychological depth of Gone Girl (to which the book is often compared),even the creepiness;but it is still enjoyable.I felt it could have had more potential then what it becomes in the end but still it's an engaging book;makes you think,sort out possibilities and pathways.The real discovery here is a meditation on the lives of others and how little we know about people we share our lives with."
1217,Bill Johnson,"read on the cruise to Alaska. Interesting structure of back and forth among three women; one a depressed alcoholic, one the victim and one the wife of the ex husband of the depressed alcoholic. I have to be careful not to give too much away. the perspectives switch and information is revealed gradually building to the climax. The writing is very good; ie use of words and phrasing. Not a 5 star but better than a 3. Surprised that Liz gave it a 3, but to each their own. I recommend it."
1218,Smokkee Singleton,"I just smashed my way through this book, which is deservedly getting a lot of comparisons to Gillian Flynn's hit novel Gone Girl. They're both told in alternating perspectives but TGOTT has 3 different voices compared to the couple's voice of GG. Both are tense throughout too. The only real difference apart from the story they tell is the endings. GG was strong all the way til the twist at the end, which I thought was meh. I seen the twist coming in TGOTT early but what I didn't see was the twist after the twist. Yeah, it's getting comparisons to GG but I think it should be the other way around. TGOTT is a superior read, IMO. "
1219,Sandie,"THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN is a dark, haunting and depressing psychological thriller, but it's incredibly effective thanks to the writing skills of author Paula Hawkins. Rachel is a divorced woman who would do anything for a drink, and like a lot of folks consumed by a love affair with the bottle, one might call her a victim of circumstances. Her husband Tom had an affair that resulted in a pregnancy. He divorced Rachel, married the ""other woman"" and now all three (husband, wife and child) are happily ensconced in the house that was once Rachel's.The train that Rachel rides to London each day takes her past her old neighborhood. From the window of the train she observes not only her old garden that backs up to the tracks, but also the daily activities of another couple who reside down the street from her previous home. In her imagination she has given the couple names and has created a fairy tale love life for them. Real life, however, cannot live up to her fantasy and the couple does not have the picture perfect relationship that Rachel has concocted. When a murder occurs, Rachel becomes entangled in the investigation because of what she has witnessed on her daily commute.This rather bleak story with intersecting timelines is told from the viewpoint of three different women Rachel, Anne and Megan. All the women are unreliable narrators with something to hide. In fact, most of the characters in this novel, including the men, lack veracity, and are a self-serving and unsympathetic group with plenty of skeletons in their closets.Lest I continue and divulge too much of the plot, let me just say that the twists and turns in the story are many and readers will be easily drawn in, making it easy to devour this book in one afternoon."
1220,Karin Slaughter,"Good thriller, but no Gone Girl. Everyone wants to be the next Gillian Flynn, but Gillian Flynn isn't finished being Gillian Flynn."
1221,Kelly Eeckhaut,"De mannen in dit boek zijn klootzakken, de vrouwen vond ik nogal zwak, passieloos en dus vrij oninteressant. En toch wilde ik weten hoe het afliep en kon ik moeilijk stoppen met lezen. Ik heb regelmatig gedacht dat het nu toch eindelijk maar eens vooruit mocht gaan, want ik was de personages nogal beu. Maar ik wilde weten wat er was gebeurd. Als je een boek wil uitlezen ondanks zo’n frustraties, is het toch wel een geslaagde thriller, nee?"
1222,M. Dobson,"Outstanding mystery with a great voice, although initially the number of characters as I listened to it on Audible was confusing.The main character is depressed, living a lie, but you are held at bay--unsure who is the villain, even as you doubt the main character. Lovely read, great tension, although it has a slow reveal that will drive some readers/listeners crazy. It's worth the ride. Enjoy."
1223,Λίνα Θωμάρεη,"Υπέροχη πλοκή, ενδιαφέρων οι χαρακτήρες και ένας φόνος μυστήριο... Τι άλλο να θες από ένα βιβλίο!?!?!?"
1224,Cailean,"WELL. For my first fiction book in over a decade, this was a great one to start with. I could NOT put it down and read it in one evening. The characters are pretty much all distasteful so there's no one really to identify with. You end up being taken along for the ride simply because the plot is so compelling. It reads kind of like a movie (and apparently will be a movie soon!) and definitely has a Hitchcockian flair to it. Has some bad language and sexual content. The movie will surely have to be R."
1225,Susan Lance,"I finished this book in 3 days because I could not put it down. It was so interesting to see the story from 3 points of view: Rachel, the alcoholic ex-wife of Tom who passes by her old house while taking the train into London to a non-existent job that she was fired from but hasn't told anyone yet; Megan, Scott's wife who lives a few houses down from Rachel's old house, and who Rachel imagines a whole life for Megan & Scott (who she thinks of as Jess and Jason) until the day Megan turns up missing; and Anna, the new wife of Tom/nemesis of Rachel who not only lives in Rachel's old house and stole Tom away from her, but also gave Tom a child. There is so much going on with each of these characters that the author just briefly touches on, but it's enough to let you know what's going on in their minds, their old lives, etc. Very well written with the transition between POV's never getting me confused or annoyed because I can't keep up. The mystery of what happens to Megan was a shocker - have to admit I did not see that coming! But then once you know, the little things start to add up and you realize how well this book was developed. As for Rachel, at first you want to slap her and say ""Get your life in order!"" But as the book continues, you see that maybe not everything is her fault and there are suitable reasons for why she's in her situation. The author provided an ending for all the characters - that's important to me. I really don't like to be left hanging trying to figure out where/what a character went next. Very good book, highly recommend! "
1226,Cassie Derby,"Excellent read! Great story, very suspenseful. Definitely kept me on my toes towards the second half of the book!"
1227,Aliena,"Muy recomendable, quizá un poco previsible, pero con un estilo narrativo increíble"
1228,Tori (InToriLex),"Find this and other Reviews at InToriLex  Actual Rating Three Point Five Stars
This book has been compared over and over to Gone Girl but I find it very different. Rachel is very sad and a self destructive character, her plans are driven by obsession. Gone Girl focused on a sociopath determined to get revenge on her husband. There both good thrillers, but in The Girl on a Train you go through many circumstances where characters act out of anger and emotion but none carry out well planned actions.
""I have never understood how people can blithely disregard the damage they do by following their hearts. Who was it said that following your heart is a good thing? It is pure egotism, a selfishness to conquer all.”
These people are broken in this book. Ms. Hawkins does a great job of exploring characters and making you feel that they are real people, making real decisions.  I do think that some parts of this book was drawn out and the build up towards the climax took too long. While I enjoyed reading the book and progressing with the plot, some of it read like filler and came off as boring because of it.Bad relationships can really mess a person up.  I think many people don't empathize with those ending relationships, until they feel it in their own lives. All three of the women who narrate the book, are dealing with relationships where they are trying to find happiness. Unfortunately they all lose pieces of themselves while trying to create perfect relstionships. I could really identify with how sometimes you can feel overwhelmed in relationships and have to fight to take care of yourself first.
“It’s impossible to resist the kindness of strangers. Someone who looks at you, who doesn’t know you, who tells you it’s OK, whatever you did, whatever you’ve done: you suffered, you hurt, you deserve forgiveness.” 
If you enjoy thrillers this was definitely a good one, that has a fast moving plot. This gives great insight into how people can morph and manipulate.  If you think somethings off, your probably right. I did not see the ending coming, but it was definitely a satisfying conclusion."
1229,Kim ,Totally recommend this to people who like smart thrillers.
1230,Lydia Marie,"I enjoyed this a lot! I did guess the ending before I got there, but only about 3/4 of the way through. For a person who prides herself in her ability to guess plot twists before they come... Pretty good! "
1231,Vilma's Book Blog,"An addictive, suspenseful page turner.[3.5 to 4 stars]The blurb above notes that this book is ‘compulsively readable’ and I think that statement best sums up how I felt about this novel. I just couldn’t put the book down despite some issues that affected my overall reading experience. I wanted to know what happened, how the mystery would unravel, how secrets would tumble out. Author Paula Hawkins did a good job of keeping me on edge as the novel unwound in an almost cinematic fashion. The story was always in motion with shifting timelines and questionable stories recounted by untrustworthy characters. Imagination and reality dueled as I sought the truth to the events that led to the disappearance of one of our three female protagonists.
“I am not the girl I used to be. I am no longer desirable, I’m off-putting in some way. It’s not just that I’ve put on weight, or that my face is puffy from the drinking and the lack of sleep; it’s as if people can see the damage written all over me, can see it in my face, the way I hold myself, the way I move.”
We first meet Rachel—the girl on the train—who has lost her job, lost her husband and exists most regularly in a drunken stupor. To escape her sad reality, she revels in a fantasy where two people live an idyllic life. Two strangers whom she sees every day as she glimpses out of her window on the train. But one day, everything changes and she finds herself caught up in a chilling mystery where her past, present and fantasy worlds collide.
“I have lost control over everything, even the places in my head.”
We also meet Megan, half of the happy duo Rachel sees from her faraway perspective on the train. Megan is happily married to Scott, or at least that’s what Rachel surmises. But in reality, Megan’s life is not what it seems, and chapter by chapter, we learn just how much her facade hides. Down the street from Megan, live Rachel’s ex husband Tom and his wife, Anna. And it is on this street, behind the walls of these homes, that the story takes flight, connecting the lives of these five people in the most twisted, unexpected ways.
“There’s nothing so painful, so corrosive, as suspicion.”
The crux of the story revolves around the disappearance of Megan Hipwell, and what happened on the night she disappeared. The same night Rachel was so drunk that she stumbled home bleeding, her memories swiped clean.What happened? Who was responsible? What role, if any, did Rachel play?To me, the novel had many strengths. It was absolutely impressive as a debut novel. The plot was strong, hinting at a myriad of possible scenarios. Hawkins is masterful at delivering three point of views, giving us just enough to confuse us and entice us… keep us on edge. I loved how she explored the fallibility of memory and the power of imagination and suggestion. Each of the characters in the story is at best unreliable and deceptive, and at worst, a murderer hiding in plain sight.The first half of the story felt slower to me, perhaps lingering too much on certain aspects, but the second half of the book moved much more quickly. The biggest issues I had were with the female characters… they frustrated me, particularly Rachel. I’m not saying the characterization was not done well, it’s just that these women were often irritating. Rachel especially made horrible decisions, pushing herself into situations she had no business being in and on top of that, she was drunk most of the novel. I completely understand that was likely the intent, evidencing the unreliability of her persona, but it unfortunately curbed my reading enjoyment. In fact, her story felt very tragic and sad, and I couldn’t help but feel the very thing she detested most… pity.Overall, the novel is definitely well written, richly imagined and masterfully twisted, despite the frustrating choices of our heroines. The end was fabulously executed and I was really happy with the conclusion. I listened to the story on Audible, which was particularly great for discerning between the various POVs. If you’re a fan of suspense, this is definitely a story worth reading.
“The holes in your life are permanent. You have to grow around them, like tree roots around concrete; you mould yourself through the gaps.”

1232,Jack Taylor,"WOW. The girl on the train was something else. While it is in the same vein as Gone Girl, it is really different in terms of how it the story is executed and presented. I like having the multiple POVs and flashbacks and the overall thick web of mystery that the author created. I loved the main character and all the complications that surrounded Rachel. Also the ending was well done and amazing. Quick paced, well written, dark and mysterious characters, and superbly written plot! Well done. "
1233,Jose Santos,"Um livro que se lê muito bem apesar de, no início, eu ter demorado a entrar no ritmo da narrativa. Digamos que este tipo de história não é o que mais me atrai mas como está bem escrito, acabou por ser difícil pousar o livro sem matar a curiosidade de saber o autor do crime.As personagens estão muito bem descritas, ambíguas e difíceis, como devem ser num policial.Mas não é nem um pedrada no charco nem um prémio nobel da literatura. Os ""dois milhões de cópias vendidos em pouco tempo"" devem de ser resultado de uma boa estratégia de maketing. É, simplesmente, um bom thriller policial. Aconselho a leitura para os apreciadores do género."
1234,Rose,"This is one of those books that I found it hard to like any of the characters, but, pardon the pun, like a train wreck, it was hard to look away, and I felt compelled to learn what would happen. I was also compelled to find out why, oh, why these women were such a “hot mess”.Between an alcoholic, a liar and a cheat, who can you trust while they are telling their story? That was a clever approach to a book. The unrelenting bleakness of Rachel’s situation was difficult to bear. The characters were consistently (counting my blessings) difficult to relate to, dealing with a multitude of serious dysfunction from addiction, infidelity, murder, abuse, obsession, mental illness and life-altering guilt. But I read it to the end to find out what happened…very clever of the author, if you ask me."
1235,C.W.,"Read this mostly on the plane to Portland last week and really enjoyed it. Well, for the most part. It's characters, plot, and outlook are all super bleak and kind of depressing, but I enjoyed the twists and turns and the writing itself."
1236,Rosa,"Lo sospeché desde un principio pero igual me gustó, la historia no es tan suspenso o para mi no lo fue tanto, quizás no me enfoqué en eso porque me gustaron los personajes. Also: quotes.''Let’s be honest: women are still only really valued for two things—their looks and their role as mothers. I’m not beautiful, and I can’t have kids, so what does that make me? Worthless.''“You’re like one of those dogs, the unwanted ones that have been mistreated all their lives. You can kick them and kick them, but they’ll still come back to you, cringing and wagging their tails. Begging. Hoping that this time it’ll be different, that this time they’ll do something right and you’ll love them. You’re just like that, aren’t you, Rach? You’re a dog.” También el final cos blood. Me encanta la sangre en los finales."
1237,chrissy,"Interesting premise about a woman who rides the train to and from work everyday and what she sees during her commute. I like that it was told from the POV of three women, the main character being an unreliable narrator at best. It was enjoyable trying to figure out what did and didn't actually happen. There are quite a number of reveals that occur during the book, but I think my favorite was one of the first, when we find out that one of the houses she sees everyday on her train ride used to be hers."
1238,Joseph,A good psychological thriller that will keep the reader guessing. A good mix of mystery and an unreliable narrator. 
1239,Gigi,"Pass the wine please. On second thought.... Alcoholism at its best. Shaken not stirred with Loneliness, Despair, Betrayal, Child endangerment, murder, murder, murder and mass transit. There is no end to the shadows that are creeping in from all the possibilities of Rachel's black outs. With a glass of wine in hand and this book in the other I found my self screaming ""WELL WHAT REALLY HAPPENED?!"" This woman gets black out drunk and cannot grasp reality for a second to save her life. I just can't deal with wanting to shake the booze out of a fictional character just to ask her how the story ends. 4 stars!! and I'd read it again. "
1240,Barbara Sheppard,"I found this book to be a compelling read. After a slow start the pace picked up and things started moving along rather nicely.I understand the premise of flipping back and forth between characters but I found myself often having to look back to see which day it was and who was talking.I kind of had a love hate relationship with the 3 women. Rachel was pretty pathetic and at times I wanted to throw the book against the wall. She kept doing so many stupid things and just could not mind her own business. In the end, I do not know if her actions were helpful or not....would the mystery have been solved without her butting in?It was just frustrating to keep reading about these vulnerable women who kept making one mistake after another and could not seem to stand up for themselves."
1241,Cindy Ottinger,"The set up for the main plot was a little slow, but once I figured out who Rachel was and how her life intersected with the other characters, it was a very good mystery. I stayed up WAY too late into the night to finish this one!"
1242,Dwayne Thompson,Really liked this book. It's kind of like Gone Girl. But if everyone was a lunatic and untrustworthy. So kind of exactly like Gone Girl. 
1243,David O'neal,Really good. Not one redeeming character in the novel that adeptly points out the flaws in everyone despite how they present or are perceived. The plotting was tense and sometimes uncomfortable and it helped push you along. Although the ending was predictable it was fun getting there. My only knock was how late Anna as a narrator popped in. 
1244,Denise Touvell,I hated Gone Girl and am not really sure I loved this book. But I read it in one day and the author did a great job of keeping me guessing. What more can you ask for in a suspense novel? I look forward to seeing what this author has to offer in the future.
1245,Desiree,"As befitting the psychological thriller genre, The Girl on the Train explores the powers and limitations of perception in its three morally ambiguous female characters, whose lives intersect throughout the book in seen and unforeseen ways. Rachel occupies the role of protagonist and we see much of the story through her eyes, but the other two women, Megan and Anna, also have their own chapters. In combination, the multiple points of view sculpt a three dimensional portrayal of the events that unfold and, as the plot unravels, teases the twist that comes at the end. Up until the final chapters, I thought the character development of Rachel and Megan were very good – there was no sugar-coating or idealizing – they felt like real human beings in the raw. By comparison Anna was really flat and simple, which was disappointing, but I am still glad her perspective was in the mix. It added to the story in crucial ways, and, let’s face it, you can’t have a good modern book about human psychology and experience without a basic bitch in the casting…Jokes! Anyways…The ending let me down. The author did such a great job building her female characters, but Tom’s sudden importance at the end steals all their thunder (even Anna gets stiffed). I couldn’t help but think “of course it’s just this one asshole ruining the lives of three women.” And naturally for this guy to fit the bill, for us readers to be convinced of his mega assholery, he is turned into not just a cheat, but a manipulator, pathological liar and abuser of women. You start to get an inkling of his shady ways in the middle of the book (beyond being a cheater), but then it hits you all at once at the end like an avalanche. While I anticipated Tom’s true part to play in the plot, I still was like “Holy shit, Tom! Where did all your crazy come from?”I appreciated Rachel as a seriously flawed, gritty individual. I didn’t need or want Tom to make her a more “sympathetic” character, as is what happens when we find out he was manipulating Rachel all along into thinking she did terrible things while she was drunk. And when his second wife, Anna, discovers he’s been lying to her, we gradually we see the signs of a fledgling spouse snoop and alcoholic in her, too. Are we to believe that he turned our unconventional heroine Rachel into a sad, lonely, hot mess alcoholic with stalker-esque hobbies, along with his second wife?That’s too much power for a character who only nominally mattered up until the final chapters of the book. Although I hated the role Tom’s character played to tie up all the plot strings, I enjoyed his symbolic death by corkscrew. It was no symbolic accident that Rachel aimed for his throat. "

1247,Judy V,"I had to read this story for a book club that I belong to. Everyone said this was like Gone Girl and since I never finished that book I did not have high hopes for this one. This book is told from multiple POVs and it move back and forth through time.....that is why it doesn't receive 5 stars from me. This story was intense, suspenseful and was always making you want to slap the daylights out of the main character. For a story to pull that much emotion out of me has to be pretty good. It kept me on the edge of my seat until about 90% thru and then it was one heck of a ride from there. "
1248,Tina Clay,Great read.
1249,Lori Grelli,Lots of twists and turns- good book!
1250,Joan Martin,Whew! That was a good ride!
1251,Nivedita (thebooklovingnerd),"When a book takes away your life and makes you forget about the real life around, you can trust the book to be the best. When you read this book, you end up giving up on your real-life duties and chores and just snuggle in the bed with this book and steaming cup of coffee. And when you finish the book, you question everyone and everything around you, like is anything even real?The Girl On The Train is told from the perspectives of three women, three mentally unsettled women and each of them has a story to tell about their lives revolving around one guy. An alcoholic who lost her husband to another woman; the other woman who is living happily with the man as his wife, but has a lot of secrets buried within and the cheat who ruins the lives of not one but many. As the three women tell their stories, what unravels is a strange story with broken characters and their distressed lives.When Rachel sees outside the train on the way to her commute, she sees a happy couple, who she names ""Jess and Jason"" and realizes how happy she is for them, even though her life is nothing close to theirs.
“There’s something comforting about the sight of strangers safe at home.” 
But, the truth is, Jess is actually cheating on her husband, and when Rachel sees her kissing another guy from the train, she is pulled into their lives in a way she can never get out. This book takes various twists here and there, but when it reaches the end, everything stops making sense, and that is exactly why I love this book.This book is compared to Gone Girl on many platforms and when I started reading, I couldn't make the connection. But, when you close the book after finishing it, you realize it played with your mind like no other book could ever do. I can also understand why people seem to hate it. To a person who loves happy endings, and fluffy romances, this book can never be likeable. This book doesn't involve a happy ending, it only shows the truth; that we all broken in the end. FIND IT ON MY BLOG"
1252,Deana,"Well, here I go jumping on the bandwagon for this book. I was on hold for MONTHS at my library to get it. Some may have just given in and purchased it, but in my experience when EVERYONE is recommending a book and the holds are long, I usually don't end up liking it. Not because I want to be different, but I guess my expectations are so built up and nothing can ever live up to that.But maybe the opposite happened here. I was expecting it to be crap, not nearly as good as everyone says. And then... it was pretty damn good, actually. Not perfect, but it kept me guessing and kept me sucked in -- both excellent characteristics of a book for me!It was a little confusing at first, having two of the characters in one time period and the third in the past, but I adjusted eventually. I loved how unreliable Rachel was as a narrator and it kept making me wonder what she had actually done, although I felt the alcoholic blackouts were sort of gimmicky and not portrayed well. I loved how our view of Megan changes over the course of the book as we learn more about her; from perfect wife to...well, not so much. Though I also felt really badly for her and her past. I didn't have quite the negative reaction toward her as seemed to be expected - in my view, it was an accident. The real crime was covering it up.And I did not see the ending coming at all, but then looking back, I felt that I should have. Or at least, COULD have. This is a sign of a well-written book to me.Anyway, very enjoyable. If you like unreliable narrators and lots of suspense, I highly recommend this one."
1253,Jayne,Am looking forward to more books by this author.Great read - would recommend!
1254,Brightness,"I read this book in one sitting on a Sunday afternoon. It's been a very, very long time since I've read a book in one sitting. Not that I never thought about putting it down and returning later, it's just every time I did, I would come to the end of a chapter or POV section and find that I just couldn't.That, in and of itself, merits a four star rating from me.It's taut and intense. I figured out the true killer early on, and then spent almost the rest of the book second guessing myself. I questioned A LOT of things. If you don't like a book that makes you question almost everything, then go ahead and skip this one.The comparisons to Gone Girl will be endless - unlikeable characters, multiple POV's, unreliable narrators - but other than that, I did not feel like I was reading Gone Girl redux. In all, I found it a highly enjoyable read and a great way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon."
1255,Stephanie Byrnes,"You won't like any of the characters in this novel, but much like the documentary ""Making a Murderer"", you'll feel compelled to know how this story fits together and how everyone is involved. I didn't see the ending twists coming until about 2/3 through the novel, so it wasn't predictable for me. I thought almost certainly that Rachel was schizophrenic and that we would discover at the end that she was multiple characters in the novel. Fast-paced and well-written. I'm anxious to see how the movie adaptation will turn out.The last chapter was so Hollywood for me that it almost ruined the whole book, but I'm sure it will make for great cinema. "
1256,Miriam Downey,"Read my full review here: http://mimi-cyberlibrarian.blogspot.c... Rachel's life is a mess. She's divorced, jobless, alcoholic. She gets on the train every morning from her London suburb and wanders the city until work hours are over, when she returns to the flat she shares with a friend. She can't bear to tell her friend that she has no job. One of the daily train stops is opposite the house that she shared with her husband Tom, who now lives there with his new wife Anna and their baby. Every day she stares at the house where she feels her life disintegrated. She also stares at a neighboring house and fantasizes about the young couple that lives there—creating an entire life scenario for them. When the young wife, Megan, disappears, Rachel realizes that she has important information that must be shared . Rachel, however, is not the only unreliable narrator of the enfolding story. Anna tells the story from her point of view, as does Megan. They are not the only unreliable people involved in the story: Rachel's ex-husband Tom as well as Megan's husband Scott may also be unreliable witnesses to the unfolding events. To tell any more of the plot would spoil the fun. The emphasis of the The Girl on the Train is on the mysteries that surround the people that we think we know, even our spouses. The reviewer in the Boston Globe says that ""Hawkins emphasizes the parallels among these three ostensibly different women, and close the book with the knowledge that they share—as we might—unexpected affinities with people they pass by each day, those who they see but will never truly know."" Rachel interjects herself into the lives of the people at that train stop in ways that most people would not do, nor would they think of doing. That doesn't keep the majority of us from fantasizing a bit about what it would be like to live in some other place or some other house or with some other person. Does that make us unreliable witnesses to the events of our own lives?On a subway ride in New York City several years ago, I sat next to a young couple who were making out rather voraciously. Frankly, it was pretty disgusting. The man on the other side of the couple couldn't stand it anymore and complained loudly to the young man, who jumped up and yelled threateningly into the face of the complainer. When he finally calmed down, he sat back down and ranted on and on under his breath, until the complaining passenger got off the train. What was fascinating to me was not this scene, which was definitely a bit scary, but the reaction of the woman who was sitting opposite me. She was about my age and must have recognized that I was a tourist. She watched me intently through the entire incident, trying to decipher my reaction to the unfolding scene. She was trying to look at the world through my eyes. What is reality, and what is our perception of reality?I was reminded of a beautiful mansion on the lake shore in Duluth, my home city. Every time I walked by it as a girl, I pretended that I lived there. The lawn, the gardens, the porches looking over the lake—magnificent. Then, one night, the owner was murdered by her son-in-law on the main stairway in the house. Suddenly, the house became a tourist attraction, and the beautiful fantasy became an ugly reality. Everyone has compared The Girl on the Train with Gone Girl. I think that they are similar only because of the unreliable narrators. I enjoyed them both, although I think that Gone Girl twisted up my mind a bit more than The Girl on the Train. Read them and see what you think."
1257,Rachel Marie ,"The Girl on the Train Book Review I devoured Girl on the Train in about four hours yesterday. It's addicting, keeps you questioning what is going on and very similar to that of Gone Girl. Rachel rides the train every day pretending to go to work after she loses her job. Each day she see's a couple whom she names Jess and Jason. When something strange happens she can't help but feel as though she must tell the police. Diving deeper and deeper in Rachel gets stuck in a whirlwind of events. Man, these are some dark characters- Rachel with her drinking and stalking habits, Megan with her secrets, and Anna even has a scary background. People that want to like their characters may not enjoy this story as much because it is dark. Though I did love the book and it kept me wanting to read more I have to say the ending was a bit disappointing and for me, a tad predictable. I wasn't shocked. It's obvious why this book has sold millions of copies world wide and has people talking. Thrillers seem to be a huge hit today!"
1258,4cats,"This is a highly addictive psychological thriller, with the most unreliable narrator and it is filled with characters whom you struggle to like. However once started you then have to finish it. I did have my suspicions and they were correct although I did like the final twist to the tale. 3 and a half stars really."
1259,EP,"Despite not liking any of the characters, I liked 100% more than Gone Girl. Somewhere between a 3.5 and 4. "
1260,Francielli Camargo,This book is crazy and I'm exhausted.
1261,Agirlcandream,Impressive thriller/mystery novel with one of the best closing sentences in my recent memory. This book will be made into a movie within the next five years. Guaranteed. 
1262,Dora Santos Marques,"Por este livro estar no #1 de vendas do nosso país,despertou-me a curiosidade. Ia um pouco a medo porque criei bastantes expectativas. Não sendo uma obra de arte, é um livro muito interessante e viciante. Todas as personagens têm os seus demónios, demonstram os seus ""podres"" e foi isso que me cativou mais nesta história. É um thriller nada previsivel e que se lê bastante bem. Recomendo!"
1263,Josephine,"[update: I LITERALLY JUST WROTE A HUGE REVIEW AND IT SPONTANEOUSLY DELETED WHEN I UPLOADED IT. WHAT???? I WAS KINDA PROUD OF IT TOO]
I remember admitting it to myself. Thinking the thought and not dismissing it, embracing it. I wanted it. I wanted to be with Jason. I wanted to feel what Jess felt, when she sat out there with him, drinking wine in the evening. I forgot what I was supposed to be feeling. i ignored the fact that at the very best, Jess is nothing but a figment of my imagination, and at the worst, Jess is not nothing, she is Megan - she is dead, a body battered and left to rot. Worse than that: I didn't forget. I didn't care.
 So it starts off with Rachel, who is an alcoholic. 
Drunk Rachel sees no consequences, she is either excessively expansive and optimistic or wrapped up in hate. She has no past, no future. She exists purely in the moment.
 Rachel takes the same train every day. That's just how it is. She never really has anywhere to go to, but it's not necessarily about the destination itself. It's about the journey it takes to get there. Over the months Rachel soon becomes invested in the lives of Jess and Jason, whom are residents in a home that her train makes a stop near. She's build fictional lives for them in her mind, including names, occupations, pasts. Fantasies. It's as if she feeds off this story-like happiness, their fairy-tale lives. Because surely if they're blissfully happy, then she can be too? She would never dream of approaching them. That is, until two things happen. First, she sees Jess kissing another man that is not Jason. She feels that this is a direct betrayal to her, as if she should be just as angry as Jason would be if he'd known. Then, soon after, Jess - who is actually Megan Hipwell - goes missing. It is these two things that open up doors for Rachel. They offer her something to pass her days with. They offer her a purpose. They offer her a semblance of a life that she long-ago thought she'd lost to the bottom of a bottle. 
I was so glad to have a purpose that I stopped thinking about the reality.
 As the story continues it isn't too soon before you realize that she can't let go of her ex-husband, Tom, whom she still shares the same last name with. He cheated on her for another woman, Anna, who moved in straight after Rachel, bearing his child. I couldn't help but be really sympathetic and sad every time she wistfully described the home she chose and lost, or the child she desperately wished for but was never granted. 
He never understood that it was possible to miss what you never had, to mourn for it
 Strangely, though, I always found myself really excited whenever Anna's few POV's came along. It sounds bad but, honestly, all of these characters are just as messed up as each other. Anna just happened to be a little more interesting. (view spoiler)[My only problem was with the ending. Don't get me wrong, it was still very good, and I had not foreseen it, necessarily. However, due to many comments and observations made throughout the novel, it was predictable. Right until the final sentence I was anticipating some crazy revelation that didn't come. Although the ending was still very satisfying. (hide spoiler)]This book was addictively compulsive, and by the first sentence I was enthralled (and the tinniest bit obsessed). The characters were well-grounded and thought out, and the plot very intriguing. It'll mess with your head a little, and confuse you even more. But that's okay, because that's what we want. (view spoiler)[
I get into bed and turn the lights out. I won't be able to sleep, but i have to try. Eventually, I suppose, the nightmares will stop and I'll stop replaying it over and over and over in my head, but right now I know that there's a long night ahead. And I have to get up early tomorrow morning, to catch the train.

1264,Elyse,"I was immediately pulled into this neurotic woman's life. I can see why a lot of people disliked the book, it is chock FULL of entirely unlikable characters. There wasn't a single character I liked! But damn, this story. The main narrator is completely unreliable and the other two are wearing blinders so you have to file away certain things while reading each POV. I thought this was a great mystery and was a little more than halfway through the book when things started falling into place for me. I was pretty fooled for the first half. This had the Gone Girl feel but I liked the culmination of the ending way better than Gone Girl. The Girl on the Train was a disturbing story but fascinating as well."
1265,Ebru,"* Son zamanlarda pek fazla polisiye romanı okumamıştım. Trendeki kız bu açığımı kapattı neyse ki. Kitap gerçekten çok övülmüştü bende beğeneceğim ön yargısıyla kitaba başladım. Ama ilk 150-200 sayfada biraz sıkılmaya başlamıştım, görüşüm değişmişti. Bunun aksine son 100 sayfayı bir çırpıda bitirdim, yani kitabın ana yeri son 100 sayfa diyebilirim.* Yazar ilk önce bende şunu uyandırdı. Kitapta 3 farklı karakter ve bu karakterlerin anlattığı 3 farklı bölümler var. Bu bölümlerin anlatılması öyle ayrıntılı olmuştu ki, bir karakterden başka karaktere geçince sanki karşımdaki insanları değişiyormuş gibi hissettim ve bu gerçekten hoşuma gitti. Benim için kitabın artı yönü buydu.* Romandaki karakterlerin hiçbirinden hoşlanmamam benim için eksi yönüydü. Mesela bir kitap okuduğumda “aa şu x karakter aynı bana benziyor” gibi küçük hislere sahip olurdum. Ama trendeki kızda Rachel, Anna, Megan hiçbirini de sevmedim.* Sonu böyle çarpıcı olmasaydı sıradan bir polisiye diyecektim. Ancak sonunu beğendiğimden sıradanın biraz üstünde diyebilirim.* Sanırım polisiye olarak sadece Agatha Christie okumalıyım. * Bu sıcak günlerde içinizi kitapla serinletmeniz dileğiyle :)"
1266,aye I'm Lin,"Okay so *takes sip of tea* let's get this train wreck of a review started {duh, the pun was intended}This book, at the beginning, started slow and, to be honest, I expected it to be more fast paced. But, when it does pick up, it's crazy. All the characters are messed up, twisted, and broken. I can't relate to any of them, which I kinda hope for in books, but I still enjoyed it. These characters were all very flawed and hard to attach to but I found the development as a whole great. We see these characters progress from what we first thought of them to be, or how they were described as at first, into something surprising even. This book, after a good 200 pages, had me really going on about what I thought was to happen to these characters. It was a thrill but the alcohol, sexuality, and overall damage of characters was something I hadn't mentally prepared for. I did bond with the characters, and by characters I mean Rachel, and sympathized with them, shedding tears. I overall find it very well written. If anything, I wish it would've excited me a bit more at the beginning but the ending and turn out of everything satisfied me. So, yeah, if you're looking for a good mystery and thriller, you should give this one a try."
1267,Simone,While I wouldn't say this book rocked my world - it is well written and in many ways - disturbingly so. (You will have to read to know what I am talking about!)
1268,Barb Kaminski,"I enjoyed this book. It felt very ""Hitchcockian"" in premise and definitely held my intrigue for a great deal of the story. I would probably give the first three quarters of this book a 5 star rating because it definitely kept me wondering what the twist was going to be. However, as I tend to find in most of these type of mystery novels, the final outcome is never as great as the build up. Seldom is there ever a ""wow, there is no way I ever saw that coming"" moment. When there is....those books deserve a 5 star rating. Because, let's face it....there are only so many ways you can go with these things and so the overlap from one book to the next becomes a bit of a ""been there, done that"" cliché. But in this case, although the unfolded plot didn't knock me off my chair... I think it was an acceptable closure.I do feel this book deserves a decent star rating for a couple of reasons. First, is that it does present a very intriguing plot that I never lost interest in. And it's presented in a steady but consistent pace....never lagging....but also not force feeding the story. Ironically...a bit like the pace of a moving train. Quick enough to constantly keep the reader turning pages....but still methodic enough to allow for a comfortable read.Secondly I would give credit for the choice of narratives. I am a fan of split or multi person narration that allows the reader to take in the storyline from several viewpoints. I enjoy the way this type of narration reads because it always gives me a bit of feeling of a fresh start when I reach the next chapter so it never stagnates....if handled correctly. In this case, the juxtaposition of first person narrators not only gives a new viewpoint each chapter....but also helps add to the mystery at hand. A definite decent first novel for this author. "
1269,Inna,"I really liked this one. There were some minor issues, but overall I think it's worth the hype it gets."
1270,Nahree,"Rachel looks out her train window one day and witnesses something shocking that leads to a criminal investigation. Like a moth to a flame, or, more aptly, eyes drawn to a train-wreck, Rachel takes rubbernecking to a whole other level, taking it upon herself to get involved and solve the mystery. I should mention that Rachel tends to get violently drunk, frequently experiences blackouts, and once lived right by that exact train stop. A foggy memory isn't exactly the best thing to have when you may (or may not) have been involved somehow...Paula Hawkins' writing and characterization reminds me of Herman Koch because they both create such despicable characters and when you're reading the book, you feel violently disgusted and embarrassed for these supposed ""protagonists"". Everyone is an absolute hot mess and psycho and the situation they've gotten into is quite the cluster. You eventually realize that you're the girl on the train, observing the chaos down below and unable to tear your eyes away because, well, schadenfreude."
1271,Giuls90,"Un thriller scritto benissimo, non sono riuscita a metterlo giù se non per poche ore e l'ho divorato in una sola giornata... Il colpevole? Non l'avevo assolutamente capito, mi ha lasciata spiazzata la crudezza delle immagini rese dalla scrittura della Hawkins! Consigliatissimo a tutte le persone che desiderano rimanere incollate ad un libro in maniera travolgente! "
1272,Jodez,"The Girl on the Train Parts of this book hit a little too close to home, which made it difficult to get through without panic attacks of my own, but I'm very glad I did.   Sometimes I didn't know whether to feel sorry for Rachel, unable to conceive the child she so desired, she became depressed, losing her home, her husband, and eventually her job in the process.  But she was also a pathological liar, lying to herself, to her landlord and friend, her mother, the police, and to entwine herself with the man whose wife disappeared. There's not too much more I can write about this book without giving away the plot twists... I did thoroughly enjoy the story. 4.5 stars"
1273,Karla Martínez,Lista para el HO!
1274,Hugo,"Gostei deste livro, prendeu-me até à última página. Mas pecou pelo facto da autora ter fornecido pistas demasiado generosas e cedo demais que, de certa forma, retiraram algum do impacto da conclusão."
1275,Sonny Sehra,"“The holes in your life are permanent. You have to grow around them, like tree roots around concrete; you mould yourself through the gaps.”Wow, simply; wow. I had no idea what this book was but it was everywhere. The news, social media, friends were talking about it and I had read an article that it sold more books than Harry Potter did. The hype surrounding this book is almost as insane as the book itself and let me tell you, I sure as hell enjoyed this. It's already being made into a movie! People are claiming that it's the best book of 2015 and I agree with them.This is compared to Gone Girl in many ways and I understand how it is. Everything this book did, Gone Girl did better and did first. However, there is no need to compare the two. This is more chilling than Gone Girl and more faster paced. It is a thrilling and heart-pounding (well written) addictive novel that I highly recommend. Similar to the story-telling of Gone Girl, this is narrated by three different females who take turns sharing their stories. It's a short read (shorter than Gone Girl) and I devoured this in a week. The last few pages, I stayed up and finished it in one sitting. I felt chills by the ending. It's a must read. It's narrated by a depressing alcoholic, an unlikable liar and a cheating unlikable girl who we thought was perfect. There names? Rachel, Megan and Anna.Rachel takes the train everyday, she likes to cruise around London and she always looks out the window. She sees these couple on the porch who she sees, as perfect. She even named them as Jess and Jason. She created stories about them and watched them everyday. She saw them as the opposite of her tragic past. To escape reality, she imagines the lives of people she doesn't know. Then it happened.Rachel saw Jess (real name: Megan) kissing another man which broke her heart. She was upset, drank her way out of the situation. But no! - It wasn't just done yet. It was only the start.Megan had gone missing (Megan is missing? Anybody seen the movie?) a day after she saw her kissing somebody else that wasn't Jason. She is now part of their lives, unsure of what to do and she doesn't stop there.I'm going to try not to spoil it all for you and hopefully I don't. This novel is utterly insane and addicting. The characters were messed up and depressing, it was overall; an entertaining and fun read.That ending ruined me and my heart was pounding as fast as going down on a giant Roller Coaster.It's a must read.Filled with unexpected secrets, twist of plot and mysteries that we do not see hinted before. It's horrifying and creepy; it's insane and addicting, you won't be able to put it down.Plot: 8/10Characters: 6/10Style: 8/10Overall: 8/10"
1276,Brandie,"Disturbing and suspenseful. I really enjoyed it – it was perfect for this time of year, when I love reading creepy thrillers. This one kept you guessing until the very end.I loved how unique the story was. And that it was written with several points of view, as well as having flashbacks to before the crime happened. My mind was in overdrive trying to piece things together and figure out how it all connected. The author does a really wonderful job of making you question everyone and everything.Great debut from this author and I definitely recommend! I’m sorry for such a vague and short review, but books like this are better read without any spoilers!"

1278,Steven Langdon,"There is no other way to put it -- this is a very good book, a great read, but not a serious book.The plot rolls along quickly, like an express train, not the stop-and-go commuter line that Rachel (the main character) travels on each day. Three people express their differing perspectives, Rachel of course, Anna who is the new wife of Rachel's ex-husband, and Megan who is the idealized perfectly happy woman that Rachel often sees from her train window as she sadly drinks her gin and tonic while she commutes back to her lonely single room. The reader thinks perhaps this is to be a probing exploration of different women's lives, and the angst that can afflict them all. But then suddenly a shocking event takes place and we are into a murder mystery. And Paula Hawkins handles this very well -- a compulsive detective story, with complex motives for possible perpetrators, and a timeline that adds to the complications. Once into this part of the book, readers will rocket along, anxious to follow Hawkins in the twists and turns she skillfully builds.I enjoyed the ebb and flow of this book, the mystery which Hawkins underlines with her three-person varying perspective. Nice work, I want to say at the end -- you kept us with you and yet surprised us with your ending. But somewhere, somehow, I can't help feeling, Paula Hawkins lost her focus on the desperation that is there in Rachel at the beginning, and maybe Anna and Megan too. There is a story in this story of the hard dilemmas that modern women actually face. And in the end Hawkins does not pursue that story -- that's what a more serious book would somehow have handled.Rachel is badly hurt by her inability to conceive a child and her drinking addictions; Anna has the child with Rachel's ex-husband that Rachel couldn't, but is having doubts about a homebound life; and Megan, it turns out, is not the perfect half of a couple, but someone with serious questions about commitment. These realities turn out to be crucial in solving the murder mystery -- but I'm left asking ""and then what happens"" about the larger social questions that this plot is built on. "
1279,Miranda Lynn,"4.5 starsI don't even know where to start with this one. I had been SO SO excited to read this book! It took forever for me to finally get it from my library, and I immediately dove right in. I seriously can't believe that this is Paula Hawkins' debut novel. That's insane. So many people have been RAVING about it lately, and I'm a huge thriller person, so I couldn't wait to get started on this book.

""There's something comforting about the sight of strangers safe at home.""

I almost feel like I can't even really write a review for The Girl on the Train. It's something that you really have to experience for yourself. It's very much in the same vein as Gone Girl in that the main character can be an unreliable narrator at times, and you never really know who's telling the truth or what to believe. And I love those kinds of books. Unreliable narrators are one of my absolute favorite kinds of characters. And that was something that Hawkins did very, very well and was probably the thing I liked most about this book. Another thing that was great about The Girl on the Train was the writing style and the prose. Beautiful. Just perfect. I loved it so, so much. In fact, it totally sucked me in. I can't even explain how sucked in I was by this book. From the very first page, I was like, ""Yup, it's going to be one of those!"" I had to practically yank it from my own hands in order to make myself put it down, and I was constantly thinking about it even when I wasn't actively reading it.I also liked the fact that there were multiple narrators. I feel like that aspect of the book was, again, handled very well by Hawkins. A lot of the time when a book has more than one narrator, especially if there's more than two, I will have trouble fully connecting with the characters because I feel like I'm not getting enough individual time spent with each one — and that's usually only multiplied when it's a relatively short book like this one. But unlike what usually happens, I felt super connected to each character in this book. I couldn't necessarily relate with them all, and you're really not supposed to, because some of them are quite awful! But I still felt like I knew and had an attachment to all of them.I don't want to say anything about the plot, really, because it's hard to talk about without spoiling. You should really go into this book not knowing too much about it. But I will say that, for most of The Girl on the Train, I found the plot very exciting and constantly evolving. It was a very tangled web that became more and more unraveled as the pages turned. Eventually, though, I got to the point where it was obvious to me who was the ""bad guy."" And so then I had to wait for a few more threads to be unknotted while I waiting for the climax to finally come around. That part was my least favorite part of the book, because I feel like Hawkins did such a great job creating this incredible suspense and buildup around the final reveal that it was just slightly disappointing that her hints became a little too clear towards the end, before characters actually came out and said who they had realized it was. But, to be fair to the book, it really wasn't that much prior. I was in the dark for most of the book (although I had many theories!), so I only had to sit around with my untimely knowledge for a few chapters before everything was put out in the open. Speaking of the reveal, one part of the book that I thought Hawkins did a particularly good job on was the climax itself and then what happened directly after the climax. I feel like, sometimes, thrillers peak at the moment of the reveal, then slowly just kind of end without much finesse. The part you've been waiting for all this time has finally arrived, so whatever comes afterwards is more like an afterthought and not really that important. But Hawkins made me care about the afterwards. And I really, really appreciated that decision on her part. After the initial climax, the scene continues for quite some time and is really suspenseful regardless of whether or not you figured out the ""bad guy"" previously. It was a tense situation that had me completely on the edge of my seat and I LOVED IT. It made the plot really linger for me and not fizzle out as quickly as it usually does. Hawkins deserves major props for that.Well, I guess I did end up kind of reviewing it, haha! I thought that I wouldn't be able to come up with thoughtful things to say, because it's such a popular book that so many people have reviewed, and just thinking about writing down my opinions was pretty daunting! But The Girl on the Train deserves a real review from me, so I just had to share what I was thinking. If you haven't already read this book...seriously, what's wrong with you? Get on the Train train!! It's an exceptional thriller that will be intriguing to almost any reader. "
1280,Lissa Albert,"Well written, different perspectives keep the reader wondering just what will happen next. Not entirely unpredictable, but throughout most of the book, reader is kept in suspense, so it didn't have the answers written all over it. All in all, a good read."
1281,Anissa,"There's a whole lot of crazy crammed into this story and I rather enjoyed it. I did figure out somewhat early what must have been the thing that the three women had in common and I enjoyed reading along to find out that I was correct. I found the reveal, confession & resolution rather quick (it's literally a few pages) but I've read other books where this happens so I think it must be that the journey was really the point and the Who and Why is not the raison d'être. I found it most difficult to abide with Rache but she's the first unreliable narrator I've enjoyed reading in a very long while. This close look in with an alcoholic was suffocating, uncomfortable, pitiable and infuriating all at the same time. Ultimately, I think she was well written because I felt a lot for and toward her as I read. I even hoped for her to succeed at something, anything, for herself in the end. Meghan, while she had her own box of issues was a bit less real to me or more correctly, she was remote. I don't know if that was by design or just my interpretation while reading about her point of view. Though told in her voice, I felt that I never knew who she was. I was reading about her but I never felt like she was quite there. Given how things unfold in the story, perhaps that's the point. Anna seemed a clear character and while I didn't like her either, I saw where she was coming from and took some satisfaction in the truths that rained down on her about the life she cattily constructed and had thought she was immune from. The men in the story, Scott, Tom and Kamal were fine as characters but never felt as well crafted as the women and given that they are the hinges on which most of the angst is hung, I found that a shame. Still, their actions did come together neatly and I thought they were woven in well.I know this is oft compared to Gone Girl (which I've not read) so I don't know if it's a must read for fans of that book, but I do think it's a great and fast read for fans of mysteries and psychological thrillers. If you like intimate looks at the not so pretty sides of people, give this one a read."
1282,Kirsti (Melbourne on my mind),"There are two things that everyone says about this book:1. ""OMG IT'S THE NEXT GONE GIRL!""2. ""The narrators are all horrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrible."" I feel like any popular thriller with a big plot twisty reveal is going to earn comparisons with Gone Girl. I didn't find this as enjoyable or compelling as Gone Girl, mostly because I figured out who the villain was part way through. And I didn't find the narrators especially horrible, which either makes me a horrible person or is because I'm also currently reading The Catcher in the Rye, and ANY character seems pleasant compared to Holden Caulfield. Sure, they all make terrible decisions. But they also all felt trapped by their circumstances and couldn't see a way out. It's a fast-paced story, and I read it cover to cover in less than a day. It loses a star for occasionally feeling like a rinse-and-repeat story because OH LOOK RACHEL'S DRUNK AGAIN AND NOW SHE'S TAKING THE TRAIN. But on the whole, it was a compelling book with a pretty damned great ending. "
1283,Karyn Altshuler,"This one has you to almost the end, but i figured it out...suspenseful, but not 'scary' suspenseful. Be prepared to jump characters and timeline a lot. 24 hour read if you have the time."
1284,Lorri Steinbacher,"Every book in this genre wants to be the next Gone Girl. This isn't it, but it is a well-paced thriller with some plot holes, but nothing that takes away the enjoyment of it. Rachel is sympathetic and pathetic. All the male characters are either evil or smarmy. Just as it should be in this type of book."
1285,Mallorie,"I liked the suspense, even though the characters were extremes. It was still a fun read that went by quickly."
1286,Aliix Carranza,"Que puedo decir,odie a las tres mujeres,a Rachel por ebria, a Anna por paranoica y mensa y a Megan por ser una cabrona ansiosa sin remedio,aunque el premio al desprecio es al grandisimo hijo de puta de Tom (& pensar que existen humanos asi) sin embargo una parte de mi compadece a Rachel, los estrago de una traición así son muy jodidos.Así que me gusto por la atmósfera de ansiedad/miedo que dejaba en mi en cada capítulo xD"
1287,Jillian Lopez,"It was somehow boring and slow, especially at the beginning. BUT THE ENDING WAS MINDBLOWING. The Girl on the Train is a psychological thriller, and resembles a little bit of We Were Liars by E. Lockhart. The beginning was quite misleading; however, as the story continuously progresses through and through, pieces of the story's jigsaw puzzle fit well together to formulate quite a surprising plotline in the end.Just so you know: This is an  Adult novel, but it reads like a YA. I'm 100% sure that Young Adult readers, like myself, would quite enjoy this book somehow.Review to come at the blog!"
1288,Sinead,"Paula Hawkins highly anticipated debut novel keeps you on the edge of your seat until the climatic ending. The writing style of the novel is fantastic, switching character perspectives in order to remain fresh and giving layers of depth to the plot. My only complaint with this novel is the gaps in the middle of the story where there is no build up...or...relevance i guess. It's kind of like the main character (and other characters) go off on a tangent whilst revealing their backstory which can be slightly boring, but all in all it was an amazing book. I definitely did not see the ending coming and the action packed climax was definitely worth the wait!Don't read this novel if you are too young or 'immature' to deal with it's many adult themes, including alcoholism, violence, domestic abuse and the sexual content involved. The book does not dwell on sex scenes however the concept of sex plays a pivotal role in the story."
1289,Peggy ,"It would be difficult to actually convey why I found this creepy, disturbing thriller to be so entertaining so I'm not going to try! I would even consider re-reading this in the future just to see how I felt knowing how it would end. Very impressive novel for a first time author. "
1290,lindsey middleton,"I stayed up way past my bedtime to finish this last night. My reaction at the end of almost every chapter was ""OMG!! WTF??"". I don't want to give away anything about the story. So, I'll leave it as this - if you like thrillers / mysteries with twists and turns at every stop, pick this book up. I'm glad I did."
1291,Sheree,"The Girl on the Train has garnered a lot of attention, opinions are divided but go into this one with as little foreshadowing as possible and just let the disturbing twisty-ness suck you in ... you'll appreciate the normality of your own life. These characters are messed up, all of them, seriously messed up. It's an interesting character study that had me impressed with the authors skill, it's not an easy feat to keep a reader reading with a cast of unlikable characters. That said, as the story progressed I felt a begrudging sympathy for one of the most manipulated characters. The writing is strong and the narrators are great, they add that bit extra to the reading experience, I'm glad I picked this one up on audio. And the ending ... I actually laughed, not sure that was the desired effect. HA. What can I say ... I like to see someone get their 'just desserts' :)"
1292,Priyanka,Ending could've been a little more dramatic but overall really good
1293,Marcia Gage,I found it more of a psychological thriller than a simple who done it. I think the relatively few who gave it a low rating may just be jealous they didn't write it.
1294,Kris Mehigan,"First, this is a 4.5-star review, not 4.0.Wow! Am lovin' me some untrustworthy narrator. The story itself, though not action-packed, is gripping. Each page brings new details of each character that makes the events spin. At some point during the story, I suspected every single character of committing the crime (don't worry, no spoilers here). I loved the British-ness of the story. It's Gone Girl in London. Yes, leaves you with the same sense of marriage is a doomed institution. The only reason I didn't give it a full 5-star rating is I felt the ending left me slightly unsatisfied. The main character, Rachel, could have used a stronger growth arc.But otherwise, well done Ms. Hawkins! "
1295,Laura Elisabeth,"I absolutely loved this book, definately in my top five of this year! Highly recommend to psychological thriller lovers. Great Book!!"
1296,Lelia Piet,"We’ve all had moments when we dream fantasy lives for neighbors or people we see by random encounters. However, as normal people we don’t become obsessed. In Paula Hawkins debut psychological thriller, The Girl on the Train, the characters sway far from ordinary. The story is conveyed by three narrators, all women with extraordinary characteristics: The lead narrator, Rachel Watson is an alcoholic with memory lapses so large the reader will struggle to know who she is (as Rachel cannot remember for herself and must rely on the accounts of others to piece her days back together). Megan Hipwell is a woman with so many secrets and past lives the reader is left wondering what has she yet to let us in on and will we ever know all of her secrets. And finally a sugary, manipulative woman, Anna Watson, who seems to be struggling to lead an ordinary life but her actions leave the reader wondering which side of Anna will ultimately win out in the end.Rachel Watson’s life has not turned out in the manner of which she had dreamed, far from it actually. Rachel had an opportunity for a storybook happy ending: a loving husband, a job, a home and plans for a family. How then, did everything go so wrong? If only she could remember. Rachel’s daily commute to London takes her past the life that she lost to alcoholic blackouts, stopping at a signal just behind her old neighborhood where her world went awry. So painful is seeing her former home, now shared by her ex- husband, his new wife and their child, Rachel focuses instead on a couple living a few houses down. She gives life to the neighbors she might have had, fantasizing them into a perfect, beautiful and happy couple, even assigning them poetic names. Until one day Rachel spies a scene from the train that shatters the dream she has assigned the couple. Rachel learns the next morning (after one of her drunken stupors) that the fantasy woman, Meagan Hipwell, has been reported missing. As Rachel pieces together the events of the prior evening, she discovers that she was in fact in the neighborhood at the time the woman was last reported having been seen. Taking on the self-proclaimed role of “Nancy Drew” she begins investigating the disappearance of Megan Hipwell. She must first, however, play sleuth to her own whereabouts and actions of the night in question.Megan Hipwell is bored. She has reinvented herself so many times over that she no longer knows who she is and what she really wants. She should be happy. Megan has a doting husband and beautiful home. Why then does she seek situations that could rip her world apart and dream of running away, yet again?Anna Watson has gotten everything she wanted. She was the mistress that won. She got the husband, the home and the beautiful baby. Now she wants the one nuisance in her life gone, the ex-wife, Rachel Watson. No one knows what goes on behind closed doors and lives dreamed up while on passing trains rarely correlate with what is happening inside the mysterious abodes.Narration from the story’s orators are scrambled but well done. As the pieces of the story start to fall into place, the reader will turn page after page to learn more. The women in this novel are unreliable, calculating and flighty, and the men are unquestionably flawed. It is difficult to find anything in common with these characters or genuinely likable for that matter. The unlikelihood of them all being entwined however, is what will keep the reader chugging along. "
1297,Sunni,"Overall, pretty strong and certainly enjoying to read. I wasn't thrilled by the ending however."
1298,Poli Lauria,"Esta historia nos cuenta sobre Rachel una mujer que todos los dias toma el tren de las 8.04 con destino a Londres. En el recorrido, el tren siempre se frena en un semaforo en el que en ese momento Rachel observa por la ventanilla la casa numero 15 de la estacion Witney. En esa casa viven 2 personas las cuales Rachel les inventa sus nombres y una vida perfecta, la cual ella esta lejos de alcanzar. Pero esta no sabe cuanto van a formar parte de su vida estas personas junto con otros personajes y así cambiarsela para siempre.En opinion personal el libro hace que el lector se ponga en la piel de la protagonista, cuya personalidad esta muy bien lograda y definida. El final muy bien desarrollado. Debo aclarar que las primeras 150 paginas se me hicieron medio lentas y me aburria, pero despues hubo algo que me hizo no poder parar de leer. Lo recomiendo para aquellos que les gustan los thriller y policiales."
1299,Gin Oliver,"When everything has fallen apart and an early AM gin and tonic is the only cure, Rachel rides the train as if with purpose and plays voyeur to her old street and the handsome couple she creates a handsome life for. As with all illusions, it’s soon shattered and a chain of events is kicked into action that brings peril by the bucketload.Alcoholic and unstable, Rachel is perhaps the most honest of the three protagonists we follow. Behind Anna’s role as the pretty usurper lies fear and emptiness of a hollow victory; as for Megan – unknowing puppet in Rachel’s commuting fantasy – there’s a chilling darkness impossible for her to escape from.Running underlying themes of addiction and destructive obsessive compulsion, these heavy, yet everyday issues are stated with a matter of factness – not accompanied by a fanfare, which of course, makes them oh so more chilling. Above all else, Hawkins delivers a casually sensitive portrayal of a woman struggling with alcoholism and a duel perception to her illness – Rachel as the woman with a demon on her back; and Anna, the victim of her outbursts.Seamlessly stitching together three POVs, the plot’s timeline is impeccable not only in its consistency, but its ability to deliver the drama and make The Girl on a Train impossible to put down. No superfluous filler included, it’s a teasing kind of prose that naturally beckons you on and on.I found the female characters well developed, but not quite to my taste on the self esteem front or their high dependency for male endorsement – horses for courses though, they fulfilled their roles well.Finding the sweet spot of momentum for every scene, The Girl on the Train marries heart-thumping high tension, terror and desperation with the slow dark, empty spots of Rachel’s addiction and depression.If you’re a fan of suspense based thrillers that track crime through the lives of the victims and accused opposed to alongside the Fuzz . . . then you’ll love it.Convincing characters, an unstoppable plot and frighteningly addictive prose, it’s a novel that’s hard to say no to."
1300,Rebecca Chapman Dann,"If you liked Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn, and/or you like to remain confused until you find out that characters in your book are not what you believe them to be, then this book is for you. What a hoot! I did not want to put it down as soon as I started it. But then it wouldn't have been prudent to be late to work so it did have to be put away on Thursday long enough for a 5 hour shift at the library. Billed as a psychological thriller, it isn't actually all that “thrilling” until right before the end, then it all comes together so fast. The girl on the train is Rachel. She rides the train every day into and home from London. She has many emotional problems and is an alcoholic. Having recently been fired from her job she continues her routine in an effort to prevent her roommate from finding out. In London every day she goes to the library, visits pubs, and walks. The daily train ride takes Rachel through her old neighborhood. At a stop Rachel has a few moments every day to be a voyeur for she can see into the back yard and through the windows of the house where she had lived in happier times. Her ex-husband, Tom still lives in her old house but now with a new wife and a baby. In another house up the road from Tom's lives a nice looking and seemingly loving young couple whom Rachel calls Jess and Jason She dreams up a wonderful life for them in her imagination and very much enjoys looking for them every day to see what they are doing.Rachel's depression and alcoholism are debilitating. She is very unhappy and still in love with her ex. She continues to contact Tom and his wife which is considered harassment, some of which she doesn't even remember. Then one day from the train Rachel sees the woman she calls Jess kissing another man. A few days later Jess, whose real name is Megan, is reported by her husband Scott as missing. Rachel tries to get involved in the case by notifying the police about what she has seen but she is an unreliable witness and not taken seriously by the police because of her reputation of harassment and public intoxication. When she contacts Scott things don't go well either. Many in this book are not who they appear to be and some have mysterious connections. Scott is a very possessive hot-head and a bit violent. Megan had at one time been an nanny for Tom and his wife Anna. Anna had been the lover of Tom's while he was still married to Rachel. The mysterious man that Meg was kissing is her psychiatrist. There are dark secrets, lies, hidden motives, and confusion. I guarantee by the time you get to about page 244 the power better not go off unless you have candles or a book light because you will not be able to stop reading. Isn't the cover art clever? The scenery is blurred representing what things look like on a speeding train and the double lettering which is how print in a jostled book often looks when reading in a moving vehicle. "
1301,Pinky,I did not suspect a thing. The unreliable narrator and cause made me super tense.
1302,Kasia,"Much better than ""Gone girl"""
1303,Pamela Small,"Superb psychological thriller. The story is narrated by three female characters. It starts slowly but quickly builds up steam and suspense. The rising plot is effective, the climax is chilling, and the resolution is more than satisfying. The style used to propel the plot along is unique and riveting. Kudos to Ms. Hawkins on this her debut novel. PAY ATTENTION TO THE DATES! The time sequence is important!"
1304,Caroline Gurgel,"Quando eu soube que A Garota no Trem seria lançado esse mês no Brasil, não pensei duas vezes, larguei minha organizada lista e comecei a leitura. Ele fora lançado em inglês no início do ano e rapidamente viralizou no mundo inteiro. Com altas expectativas, fui conferir o que tinha de tão fenomenal nessa história.Rachel, a garota no trem, faz todos os dias, no mesmo horário, o trajeto de Ashbury para Londres. Nesse percurso, quando o trem para em um sinal vermelho, Rachel olha as casas, em especial a de número 15. Lá observa, imagina e romantiza a vida de um casal, até que, certo dia, vê algo que a surpreende e a deixa atônita. Dias depois, descobre que Megan, que na sua cabeça se chamava Jess, está desaparecida e resolve ir à polícia contar o que sabe. Com isso, termina se metendo mais do que deveria nesse caso e na vida de gente que ela só via pela janela do trem.Chamam de thriller psicológico, de livro de mistério, de suspense. Para mim, é um drama sem tirar nem pôr. Sim, tem um mistério, um quem-é-o-culpado, um o-que-aconteceu, mas acima de tudo está o drama de uma mulher sem forças para se reerguer, que encontra na bebida algumas horas de, não diria felicidade, mas esquecimento.Rachel é uma personagem incrível, muito bem construída, por mais fraca e digna de pena que seja. Confesso que todo aquele desleixo me deu agonia e vontade de lhe estapear para ver se acordava, se resolvia viver. Os demais personagens também são muito bons e bem verossímeis. Alguns me deram raiva, outros me enganaram.Em meio a tantas narrativas comuns, lineares e sem dinamismo, A Garota no Trem se destaca com um texto excelente e meio fragmentado, escrito em primeira pessoa, alternando o ponto de vista entre três personagens. Começa bem lento, mas logo me fez entrar naquele espiral meio alucinatório, me deixou zonza, como se a personagem tagarelasse muita coisa ao mesmo tempo e eu precisasse ler aquelas linhas em velocidade alta ou como se eu estivesse tão embriagada quanto ela.No início, como não havia lido a sinopse, não tinha ideia de qual era a da autora, que história ela queria contar, fiquei completamente às cegas. Demora um pouco para “acontecer” algo e a partir daí é difícil largar o livro. A autora tinha margem para terminar a história de diversas maneiras, todos podiam ser culpados. Suspeitei até da minha sombra! E, no final, gostei bastante do caminho escolhido.A autora foi além do simples mistério. Fez-nos vivenciar a difícil luta de uma alcoólatra, nos deu uma mostra da vida de uma mulher em depressão, de alguém que se anula e projeta sua felicidade na felicidade dos outros, de alguém sem perspectivas, que acha que a vida dos outros é maravilhosa, que ninguém tem problemas, que a grama do vizinho é sempre mais verde. E nos prova que nem tudo é o que parece.Fiquei pensando bastante com quantas estrelas o avaliaria. Por um lado, merece as cinco com louvor. Por outro, é tão depressivo do começo ao fim que tira um pouco o prazer da leitura. Mas, sem dúvidas, é um livro sensacional e vale muito a pena.www.historiasdepapel.com.br4.5 de 5"
1305,Philomena Callan Cheekypee,"There was a lot of hype/chat about this book so I was really looking forward to reading it. There are three points of view in this story- Rachel, Megan and Anna. The story is mainly Rachel's story. However I thought it was well thought out to give us the other points of view. We also get told of their story in the past and present so dates are important. I thought this story was really well written. For a debut novel to get this much hype is brilliant. My rating: I would have given this a 3 star however the twist was very good and I couldn't have predicted now the last few chapters turned out so it gets a 4 star from me.For me I felt the story was a tad slow. It didn't grab my attention and unlike other books I wasn't thinking about it when I wasn't reading it. Thats my personal opinion. Some of my Goodread friends read it & loved it. That's what makes the literary world so exciting- that we all have different views on books.Having said that I'm looking forward to reading more by this author. "
1306,Elisa,"Great murder mystery with unreliable characters and a twist that really blindsided me. I listened to the audiobook and I loved one of the performances (Rachel), liked another one (Ana), but didn't care for the actress reading Megan (we got it, she's depressed, you don't have to sound like you're half asleep! - this is the only reason I don't give it 5 stars) Still, the story is intense and unexpected. I will shamelessly steal something I read on Audible: it's like rear window and gone girl mashed together. A solid mystery."
1307,Beattie,"The Girl on the Train is this year's Gone Girl. Because this thriller has taken the literary world by storm! I went into reading this novel without knowing anything about it, other than it was a New York Times bestseller. And I am glad that is all it took, because the twists threw me off guard throughout the novel, immediately hooking me into reading more. It compares to Gone Girl in some ways, but with more twists, and reads more like a soap opera special. There are so many problems going on with all the characters, that I lost count. Just take my word for it, and read one of this year's bestselling book!"
1308,Ciska,I love psychological thrillers and this is a very interesting one as it is clearly full with psychopaths. At one point I started to wonder who was going to kill who. I did figure things out halfway the book and that spoiled the fun a bit.Rachel is the worst character... apparently an hysteric drunk it is not easy to connect to her. I pitied her though which I think was actually the feeling that was needed to feel doubt about her actions but hope that it might turn out well.The two important men in this book Tom and Scott gave me an eerie feeling early on. The one a bit to much of a brute the other way to sly. I felt forced in being suspicious of both which I did not really like.I loved the idea though of being so involved in people you see in your commute every day. Considering what their lives are like and making things up for them. The story did work and there was a great puzzle if you can stand trying to solve it trough the eyes of a gin evoked intoxication 
1309,Farrah Cole,"If you like books that are written with multiple character's points of view, you will likely get sucked into this deliciously suspenseful novel about a depressed alcoholic ex-wife named Rachel, the mistress turned new wife Anna and Jess/Megan, a woman who both these women ""know"" who goes missing. Rachel is a pathetic and sad character, so desperate for happiness that she makes up a life for a couple she sees in her old neighbourhood when she passes their house on the train. To her, Jess and Jason are the perfect couple - until she sees Jess in a compromising position and learns Jess is Megan, a woman who went missing on the night Rachel was too drunk to remember. I loved how flawed all the characters are in this novel, and I thought the author did a good job keeping the reader guessing about who was responsible for Megan's disappearance. It's a short read as the author does a good job with keeping the plot moving forward and the writing style, story structure and voice given to the characters never ring false. A solid novel and a fun and light read - if you like slightly disturbing characters with poor judgement and a voyeuristic nature. "
1310,TJ 12er,"What a book! ****Spolier Alert****I am so glad I finally read this. I had a completely different idea and I actually thought it was a YA book so I went into it clueless. I loved the main character, Rachel even though she was so weak and annoying sometimes but I felt bad for her and I started to really feel like I just wanna slap her in the face and wake her up. Like ""Hey wake up!!! let go of Tom!!!! Stop drinking! get a freaking life!"" And then the murder happens. I kept suspecting that maybe Rachel has killed Megan while she was drunk that night. I then suspected Scott when he locked Rachel in the room. Then the therapist slightly. Then Anna because Rachel saw her that night but NEVER Tom until the last few chapters and damn I feel slow lol. I hated Anna too with the way she hated Rachel and talked about her but I honestly I couldn't blame her. Rachel was a mess. The writing style was perfect. Simple enough and kept me going. I loved how the author included dates. This whole novel was a nice big surprise to me. I was so happy for Rachel's ending!"
1311,Rajat Gupta,"Well the basic idea of the story is not new...One murder, a lot of suspects...some usual and some unusual and slowly the story reveals the culprit coming to the end...BUT what is different about this book is the style of writing...The book is written with the point of view of three main female character of the book, how they felt and did at those particular time frames or days.The character of Rachel in the book is of a girl screwed by her own mind because of her drinking problems and so called memory issues. The story get you glued throughout as Rachel fight with her own mind while trying to find answers and her own relation to the Murder.I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book though I predicted the killer midway through the book(not trying to sound too intelligent here, It was just a random guess) and it turned out to be correct. Would definitely recommend to people looking for a gripping psychological thriller."
1312,Dahnya,easy read!
1313,Jody L.,"Read it rather quickly. It was a page turner! After reading this and The Goldfinch, I would like to take a break from alcoholic characters! "
1314,Maryellen,"Rachel's life is a mess. Each day she rides the train into London and each day from the window as the train makes its stop, she sees THEM standing on their balcony. She calls them 'Jess and Jason'. She's fascinated by their seemingly beautiful life. She'd give anything to be the beautiful Jess. And then one day, she sees Jess but not Jason. And then~~there is no Jess.Rachel is an alcoholic. She lies to her flatmate. She stalks her ex-husband and his new wife who happen to live in the same neighborhood as 'Jess and Jason'. She's let herself go. Rachel can't stand herself. And you know what? You might not be able to stand her either. But yet, you'll want to read her story. You'll want to know her reasons. 
THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN
 is told from three perspectives. We hear from Rachel; from Jess (whose real name is Megan); and, we hear from Anna, Rachel's ex-husband's new wife. Three vastly different women who all have something in common. This debut novel is psychological thriller that has garnered comparisons to 
GONE GIRL
 and to 
BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP
~~both books that I've read and loved. If you're a fan of those books, you will find yourself lured into THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN as well. There is not one character in this book that you will fall in love with. Not one. But I promise you this; you'll remember each character and all of their sins. There are no innocents among the adults in this book. Yet I was compelled to just keep moving forward and reading more and more of the sordidness of the story. There's darkness to this novel. If you're looking for a book that will make you feel like you've got your life completely together~~this could very well be the book. Here's to never falling as deeply into the abyss as 'Rachel'!✰✰✰✰"
1315,kari,"This one is a page turner. I was caught up in what will happen next and well, whodunit.Rachel, the main narrator, is a mess. She knows she is a mess and at the start, isn't going to do much about that. She is an alcoholic who has lost everything; husband, home, job. She is living with a schoolmate from her college days, riding daily on the trains pretending to go to work and drinking. She imagines the lives of people she sees in their back gardens. Rachel drinks often to blackout. She wakes up not knowing exactly what she's done or where she's been. The feelings and failings she feels upon wakening seem very authentic. She is always going to do better tomorrow or later today, after she has a drink or two to make her feel better. The constant pull of drink is well done, I think. There are times I wanted to shake her and say don't do that, don't have a drink. And I think the frustration you feel is actually some of the frustration she feels with herself.Megan, a second narrator, is one of the people Rachel observes. Megan has her own problem, secrets and mistakes. Her thoughts and experiences are really no more clear than Rachel's as exactly with whom she is interacting isn't always clear. That adds to the mystery.The third narrator is Anna, Rachel's ex-husband's new wife. Anna seems to be more straight-forward, but maybe she is and maybe she isn't. There is her own reference to how much she has sacrificed for her marriage, but you never get to know exactly what that is and I kind of wanted that info. Does she think giving up her job that she didn't care about was a sacrifice, not getting dressed up daily is a sacrifice, or no longer having the excitement of being a mistress is a sacrifice? I'd have liked to know.There is a little backstory and introduction of everyone, but the story really kicks into gear when Megan disappears and the rest is finding out what happened to her, which would be easier if Rachel could remember what she, Rachel, was actually doing the night Megan vanished or if we knew all of Megan's story.When all is revealed, you can see where the clues were, which I like. I'll have to admit that I did have the right guess on the perpetrator, but that's okay. It wasn't obvious and there are some red herrings as well.The writing has an overall dark tone, even before what happens. It isn't a happy book and I think it works. Are there happy endings? You'll just have to read that for yourself. It is a very good thriller. I'd definitely recommend and would likely read her next book."
1316,Allyson,Fast paced and a bit frenetic; in the style of Gone Girl but not nearly as captivating. The plot had some holes and predictable angles but overall a good read. 
1317,Lara Zuberi,"The idea of what Rachel sees from the train, and how she interprets what she sees, and the fact that she becomes entangled into a mystery of a missing girl, and doesn't remember things clearly because of her alcohol intoxication, was all interesting. The themes of infertility, divorce, suspicion, jealousy are well portrayed. Dialogue is naturally written. I wish the missing girl had been more likable, so the reader could feel more emotion.Unfortunately, the story was overall predictable, though there were moments of suspense interspersed throughout. The ending scene was melodramatic and a bit disappointing. "
1318,Angela Juline,"definitely an interesting idea...i think, i, too, would make up stories of people if i rode the train everyday. "
1319,Rebbie,"Here's my blog: https://rebbiereads.wordpress.com/3 1/2 lovely stars“Hollowness: that I understand. I'm starting to believe that there isn't anything you can do to fix it. That's what I've taken from the therapy sessions: the holes in your life are permanent. You have to grow around them, like tree roots around concrete; you mold yourself through the gaps” ― Paula Hawkins, The Girl on the Train Yikes. Talk about depressing. That was the undercurrent of the main character, Rachel. Call her a drunk, call her an obsessive creep, call her whatever you want and it will probably fit her to a T. Hawkins made her a transparent woman who drowned away her sorrows and neuroses in wine, and plenty of it. And oy vey, are there plenty of sorrows. She's still madly in love with her ex-husband, verging on the cusp of being a stalker toward him, his mistress turned new wife, and of course, one creepy scene involving their new baby. Oh, and speaking of new wife, I don't care how Paula Hawkins tries to spin her, I just won't like her no matter what. I can't be besties with a character that is completely arrogant about her disgusting and inappropriate behavior. Yeah, maybe I sound like a puritan that belongs in the 1800s, but so be it. I wish we could trust people more, especially women, but unfortunately a few bad apples spoil the whole bunch. Here's a short excerpt of her nasty ass: “I miss being a mistress. I enjoyed it. I loved it, in fact. I never felt guilty. I pretended I did. I had to, with my married girlfriends, the ones who live in terror of the pert au pair or the pretty, funny girl in the office who can talk about football and spends half her life in the gym. I had to tell them that of course I felt terrible about it, of course I felt bad for his wife, I never meant for any of this to happen, we fell in love, what could we do? The truth is, I never felt bad for Rachel.... She just wasn’t real to me, and anyway, I was enjoying myself too much. Being the other woman is a huge turn-on, there’s no point denying it: you’re the one he can’t help but betray his wife for, even though he loves her. That’s just how irresistible you are.” - Paula Hawkins, The Girl on the TrainMoving on.This is a classic psych thriller, mystery whodunit that might keep you turning page after page just to get to the end. The only difference between this story and a lot of others is that most of the characters are generally unlikable. That's ok though, it just makes them more realistic in my opinion.You've probably read countless comparisons between The Girl on the Train and Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn, and all that's true, but....this book deserves to stand on its own two feet and be recognized for being the awesome and dark story that it is.So go run out and buy it, borrow it, rent it, whatever. Just don't steal it cuz nobody likes a thief."
1320,Kim,Talk about being pushed in different directions....I would think this is it and then on the next page it would be something different. Good job of the writers to keep us on our toes! 
1321,Carina Behrens,"I liked this book, although I did think the beginning was a bit slow. But compared to all the bad reviews I read before starting it, I was definitely pleasantly surprised."
1322,Dede,"This was a wonderful book to have on hand to read while we had two new furnaces installed this week. It had just the right amount of thriller tension to keep me fixated on reading rather than listening to the pounding of the workmen in our basement. I kept thinking of ""Gone Girl"" as I read. This one had a similar feel and though I felt little or no sympathy for any of the characters, it was a compelling puzzle which I enjoyed trying to ""solve."" The perfect airplane or beach read."
1323,Calley,Love a good whodunnit!
1324,Catarina M, It was one of those binge reading books that even when tou're dead tired at night you can't help but to turn another page. For me it was a perfect mistery and I did not see that coming. A really good and intense thriller!
1325,Arathi Mohan,"You think you know someone well. Then it turns out that you don't. If in one word I am to sum up this book, it is this: unputdownable. The book shuttles back and forth between narratives of three young women whose lives become mysteriously entangled. All because of a sight seen on a train journey. The book builds up to its completely unexpected climax, which just goes to show, how much can you really trust a person, even yourself?"
1326,Nynke-Boudien,"Het verhaal zit als een perfecte puzzel in elkaar. Alle kleine details blijken achteraf van belang te zijn en het geheel valt uiteindelijk aan het eind perfect in elkaar. De lezer wordt meerdere keren in het verhaal op het verkeerde been gezet, waardoor je steeds weer voor een nieuwe verrassing komt te staan. Ik zou het erg knap vinden als je vanaf begin af aan zou weten hoe de vork in de steek zit. Het boek is erg goed geschreven en is erg gedetailleerd en spannend. Mijn hele recensie is hier te lezen: http://iheartbooks.nl/review-het-meis..."
1327,Bonnie Kale,A slow start...but once the mystery picked up I couldn't put it down.
1328,Jessica,"3.5/5 I did really enjoy the beginning and its premise, woman on train observes a couple over a considerable amount of time, enough to gives them names of 'Jess' and 'Jason', then sees something shocking. However, once the 'mystery' was explained, I had a theory, and unfortunately I was bang on. That's why is 3.5 from me, I like being stumped, not having a clue how he/she did what he/she did, and the motive not being apparently obvious, in short, I like the 'mystery' being complex enough not for me to be pretty sure of what of happened and why quite early on. Having said that, it is a quick easy read, definitely thrilling, a good holiday book.I know many are comparing this to Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn, personally I preferred Gone Girl, I was shocked in that book, I didn't know where it was going, and I actually liked the ending (I'm aware many don't though). I loved it more because it was complex, there was also and added element of social commentary which I liked.I will be looking out for more Paula Hawkins books in the future, because I do think this as a debut novel showed great potential. "
1329,Amie Fung,"I'm teetering between a 3.5 and 4 rating. You have three very unreliable and terribly awful characters narrating from their perspectives making it difficult to believe anything they say. After putting aside my distaste for EVERYONE in the book and the fact that there were many unbelievable aspects of the story, I was able to enjoy this thriller. The last half of the story was definitely the page turner that I was looking for - perceptions started to change and it kept you wondering and wanting to find out what the truth is."
1330,Krystal Bond,"I found this book to be one that was hard to put down, but the end result didn't blow me away or make me feel shocked in awe. Yes, there was a twist, but for some reason it really didn't shock me. I liked how the author wrote an unreliable narrator, it made for a more interesting read overall. I did enjoy this book a lot, it just wasn't epic or mind blowing. "
1331,Liz Camiel,Reading this book is like watching a trainwreck. The story kept me guessing but I started to feel as awful as Rachel after a night of drinking. One pet peeve of mine is when a Villain takes their sweet time to explain everything before the final climax. This one was just over the top. 
1332,Anne-Marie,"Written in almost diary format from the perspective of 3 women. Rachel has many issues and creates a fantasy world where she imagines other people's lives.I did have to keep track of the dates as the story did jump about a bit, but it was an easy read that kept a good pace and held one's interest.I guessed quite early on who may have been responsible, but such were the twists that I wasn't sure until the very end.I didn't feel as much empathy with Rachel as perhaps I felt I should, she wasn't very likeable, although believable.Anna surprised me very much, she was capable of protecting her husband despite finding out about the affair and what he had done, she didn't call the police after he attached Rachel, but then she made sure he couldn't come back!"
1333,Jonna,"I found this book to be an intriguing read with enough mystery to keep me coming back. If you're looking for something to cheer you up, don't read this. But if you like something with mystery & suspense, then you will probably enjoy this."
1334,Rachel Binting,"Read this one on the long car ride home and it was a page turner towards the end. Good read, reminded me a little of gone girl"
1335,Swagat Siddhartha,Interesting read- lost my attention at the climax
1336,Tabuyo,Mi reseña de la novela: http://contandoteunlibro.blogspot.com...
1337,Gabrielle,"Better review upcoming but first thoughts upon finishing: terrific read until the last fifty pages when it fell apart. The ""reveal"" feels like a betrayal of the really strong characters set up earlier in the book. Anna's chapters do little to merit their inclusion. I understand the appeal of having the three main women have their respective narration but Anna's chapters can basically be summarized thusly: ""I love Tom; Tom is so good. Baby baby baby baby baby have I mentioned I'm a mother baby baby. I hate Rachel; she's fat"". Also, the killer is almost Vaudevillian once the reveal happens.So it's really a shame that what was a good read for 250 pages went so tits up, because it had a lot of good things going for it up until then. Sympathetic main who makes enough mistakes so you root for her and sometimes hate her but tries so hard that you really want her to succeed, deeply engaging character-driven storytelling, and starkness and cynical humor creating a winning tone. Could so easily have won the five if it could have wrapped itself up well."
1338,Lolo,It's 4 AM and I have no idea how the hell I'm going to sleep now! This was one hell of a ride
1339,Ebrar,"Kurgu 10 numara , anlatım 10 numara , bu kitap çoğu yönüyle 10 numara..Ben bizim çok entel halkımızın (!) ~ kitabı nasil okudularsa artik ~ yaptiklari olumsuz eleştirileri görünce kitabı okumamayi bile düşünmüştüm. En iyi yorumcu en iyi okuyucu kendinizsiniz arkadaşlar .."
1340,JR,"Obviously I enjoyed the story or else I wouldn’t have rated it a 4 out of 5. The reason I didn’t rate it a 5 is simply that it took a long time before I felt engaged with the characters. I realize that the vogue is to tell the story from several characters’ points of view but in this case I felt that splitting the readers’ attention between three apparently disconnected personalities for the first 30% of the story was just too long. A nit perhaps, but I assume that’s why you read these things!"
1341,JK,"One of my favourite things to do in life is people watch. I love sneaking covert glances at complete strangers and wondering what their lives are made up of. More often than not, this happens on public transport, so this book has struck a chord.Rachel is going through an incredibly difficult time. On her way to and from work each day, her train stops behind a row of houses. She looks in the garden of a particular one and sees a couple she believes to be the epitome of happiness. Constructing a life for them in her head, seeing them each day helps her cope with her failed marriage, her loneliness, and her turbulent alcoholism. One day she sees something that doesn't quite fit into the fantasy, and things spiral out of control as she becomes involved in a police investigation. We soon find Rachel is more closely connected to the couple than we think, however to give anything else away here would be entirely unfair to future readers.Every character in this novel was overly loathsome in their own way. Hawkins really explores the darkness of the human character by using multiple-voice with three narrators as unreliable as each other. Although it doesn't take a Holmes intellect to solve the mystery, getting there is the real pleasure. Hawkins writing style is unsettling, we can't trust any of the characters, and we have no idea where we're going. Rachel's alcoholic blackouts make us distrust her, but her sorrow and regret strike up rhythms of sympathyThe most terrifying thing about the story is the implication that you never truly know a person. We all know people lie, people hide things, but to what degree? It's disturbing to think that those closest to you could have secrets that could question your whole perception of them.It's a pretty standard mystery-crime-thriller-suspense novel, and although I can understand why some dislike it, I found it gripping and fascinating. Despite the twist being predictable, and the plot starting and stopping as much as the symbolic train, I enjoyed it as a study of character, of flaw, and of the illusion of trust."
1342,☣Lynn☣,"""Life is not a paragraph, and death is no parenthesis.Review to come. I still need to wrap my head around what I just read. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~FINALLY got a copy of this!! My hold got deleted by accident and apparently I would have been hold #259 out of 16 copies....ya fuck that. So the nice lady at the library called me saying they just bought a copy for their kindle that people can check out. It's in kindle form on the first generation kindle but who cares?! I finally get to read this bitch!!!!"
1343,Milissa Straka,"Enjoyed this one even though I had the twist figured out rather early on. But well-written. The word ""quieten"" makes me itchy though. :)"
1344,Kathy,"This is another one of those times where I vacillate between 3 and 4 stars. It gets 4 for the page turning factor and the psychological suspense. It gets 3 because I read it too late in the game and listened to too much over-hype, and the characters wore me out after a bit. I agree with Kelly that is seemed a bit confusing in the beginning, and with 'Mum' that the comparisons to Gone Girl knock it down a notch.All in all it was a fast and worthy read--3.75 stars!"
1345,Gökhann,"http://gokhantezcan.blogspot.com/2016...Kitap hakkinda tek bildiğim ""kayıp kız"" ile kıyaslanmasıydı.Gone girl'ü okumamış sadece filmini izlemiş biri olarak ben hiç benzetmedim yada kıyaslamadım.Kiyaslayacak olsam gone girl 5 puanlık bir kitap bu değil.Bazı kitaplara başlayınca bir 50-60 sayfa okumanız gerekir icine girmek için.Trendeki kizda bu olmadi direk ilk sayfadan ısındım kitaba.Rachel'ın yerine koydum kendimi,empati yapmalar falan.Ama bir süre sonra rachelın ümüğünü sıkasım geldi.Bu kadar aciz bu kadar aptal aşık olamaz biri.Onun dışında olay örgüsü karakterler falan gayet guzel işlenmişti.Polisiyelerde iş biraz tahmin etmeyede kalmıştir ve ben tahmin ettim sayılır tam olmasada.Zaten bir avuç karakter vardı ve parmakla gösterilenin katil olmayacağını polisiye okuyan herkes bilir.Genel olarak güzel bir kitaptı,sıkmadı çok şaşırtmadı ama tatmin etti,beklediğimi buldum."
1346,Melodie,"First off, this is not my usual read. I don't tend to pick up the ""book-du-jour"", as they almost never live up to the hype. Like GONE GIRL which I just could NOT get into and never read more than 50 pages. This one is the exception to that general rule. Ms. Hawkins is a very skilled writer because I hated every single character in this book, yet I still kept reading. I had difficulty finding any redeeming qualities in any of these people! The story was excellent, even if it was sometimes hard to follow. It's told from 3 different viewpoints at different times, so I found myself frequently turning back a few pages in order to remember who was speaking at any given time. I had a good feel for who the ""bad guy"" was, but that didn't take anything away from the story. If you don't normally pick up a ""bestseller"" you might break from habit and give this one a try! RECOMMEND!"
1347,M. Weidenbenner,"This story was difficult for me to get into at first, but since it was our book group book I was committed to finishing it, and I'm glad I did. The reason I couldn't get into it initially was because I didn't care for the main character. She seemed weak and foolish and drank too much alcohol. But about a quarter into the book, when I realized why she was so weak, I felt sorry for her--which is always a draw for me. Then I had to know how the story ended.I suspected who the real ""bad"" person was in the story quickly, but for a long time I thought two characters were the same person. The author didn't give them enough unique and separate characteristics, so they sounded the same.I really loved how this story shows us that things are never as they appear. The girl on the train thinks she sees something, but life is way more complicated than what you see at first glance. This story was a great reminder of that.If you have trouble with intense thrillers, you might have to put this book down toward the end to take breathing breaks.I only gave it a 4 star because it's not my kind of book. It's too dark. The rating has nothing to do with the quality of the writing. The writing was great."
1348,Marika Alexander,"Spooky and suspenseful, I couldn't put it down until I reached the end! "
1349,Book Club Mom,"There’s a certain irresistible urge to invent details about the lives of the strangers we see. Sometimes it’s just a way to pass the time, but for Rachel Watson, it becomes an obsession that puts her in the middle of both a personal crisis and a crime investigation. Rachel is Hawkins’ “girl on the train,” who, during her commutes to London and back, notices Scott and Megan Hipwell, an attractive couple she believes is gloriously happy. Rachel gives them imaginary names and assigns them glamorous and exciting lives, filling a void in her own life. When Megan goes missing, Rachel is sure she can help, if she can only dig through her alcohol-clouded memories of the night Megan disappeared.I enjoyed this psychological thriller, which reminds me of the Alfred Hitchcock movie, “Rear Window” and introduces the idea that a stranger may know more about a crime than the people involved. The story is narrated by three characters, Rachel, Megan and Anna Watson, new wife to Rachel’s ex-husband, Tom. The story’s momentum is based on details that are withheld by each narrator, much like a “getting-to-know-you” phase in real relationships. It isn’t until the finish when the reader can look back and realize that, yes, this one was a jerk all along, or that one was suffering much more than it showed, this one actually showed some good qualities and that one did a good thing. A second read shows details, references and foreshadowing that may go unnoticed the first time around.Readers have criticized this withholding of details, saying it’s a contrived method to keep the story going, but I think it is very similar to the beginnings of real relationships. No one spills it all in the beginning. The big reveals often come much later.Hawkins’ female characters, although not overly developed, represent the challenges that young women face: careers, marriage and children. On the surface, these are universal choices, but for many, individual back stories and loss make it impossible to move forward. Rachel is so desperate for human contact she thrusts herself into a crisis. Megan is haunted by her own demons and behaves recklessly. And Anna has the dream life, but her possessive and territorial behavior may wreck what she has.The male characters in the story are as much a puzzle, muddled with both good and bad parts to them, causing the reader to question all of their motives. Added to the mix is a mysterious man with the ginger hair and blue eyes, someone Rachel only has a dim memory of meeting.As new facts emerge, the reader gets a clearer view of who’s who and who did what, which, at this point, moves the story to its final and tense confrontation and a satisfying finish.I disagree with other criticisms that the book’s finish was predictable. I don’t like to look too far ahead when I’m reading a book like this because I think it takes away from its enjoyment, which is the whole point, isn’t it?The Girl on the Train is a suspenseful, fast and entertaining read, with deeper questions about relationships and human contact.Thanks for visiting – come back soon!"
1350,Ai Jou,"Unlike other readers who have read Gone Girl, I have not (it's in my 'To Be Read' list). So maybe it's a good thing that I have nothing to compare against.I read 'The Girl On The Train' as it was chosen for my Book Club (for our discussion in June 2015). I was impressed that it was the author's debut novel. Being a psychological thriller, it was exciting enough to keep me on my toes, and want to continue reading from chapter to chapter. A serious crime took place and the book is all about uncovering the truth, all from the viewpoint and actions of Rachel Watson, the girl who saw something from the train.The viewpoints from the characters given in alternating chapters helped to give an all-rounded quality to the plot. It helps you understand the characters, and what makes them tick beneath their skin. The character development was also done slowly, and more pieces were revealed as you went deeper into the book. Like anything in life, you begin by knowing just a little, then more layers are peeled off until you see all facets of the person, until you begin to see their light and dark sides.You can't help rooting for the characters as you read them. It's like the author has let you into their head - you hear their thoughts, you know about the things that disturb them, you feel with them and even smell or taste with them. I think this is what was most riveting in the book. That a person, on the outside, may look smiling and happy, but inside they may be crumbling or falling apart. You never actually know, do you?Things begin to speed up as you approach the last few chapters of the novel. The ending would give you closure to the mystery, but not before you are taken on a roller coaster ride as you speed headlong into the bright, glaring spotlight of the big reveal of the perpretator. This book will certainly make a good movie one day, just like how Gone Girl has."
1351,Judy Foxwell,"I couldn't put it down!I was sorry to see the book end. I generally don't read mysteries, but this book has made me view them in a different light."
1352,Kristin,"Got lucky and was able to borrow a friend's copy this weekend. Sat down shortly after Noon today and finished a bit after 8 with breaks take for food, laundry, fetching Martin from skiing and going online.Twisted but I figured out the murderer fairly early, but kept doubting myself that it would use some of the twists from ""Gone Girl""or from ""The Other Typist"". Besides the mystery, I was quite taken with the look at alcoholism, family relationships, neighbors, and children."
1353,Pk Chance,"There are three narrators in this novel, all of them unreliable. They are unreliable for different reasons, though. The main one, Rachel, the girl referred to in the title, is unreliable because she’s a drunk. Not just an alcoholic: a stumbledown, blacked- out, puke-on-the-stairs drunk. She knows this about herself, and wants to change, but she can’t. Not yet.The quietest of the three is Anna, who is unreliable because she so firmly refuses to see what is in front of her eyes. She’s married to Rachel’s ex-husband, the guy who finally had to leave her because her drinking was just too out of hand.In the middle is Megan, who is unreliable because it suits the author to make her that way. Rachel and Anna’s unreliability springs naturally from their characters and the situation they find themselves in. Megan lies simply by omission, by talking about mysterious men who are mysterious merely because she chooses not to share their names or any identifiable information with us. She obviously can’t, because if she did, the mystery would be over before it ever got started. But it is a major weakness in what is otherwise a powerful thriller that deserves its status as this year’s Gone Girl. I wish Hawkins had come up with another way of presenting Megan's side of the story.The jist of the story is this: Rachel rides the train past Megan’s house every day on her way to work. Megan lives just a few doors down from the house where Rachel’s husband still lives with Anna, his new wife, so naturally Rachel pays careful attention to that particular row of houses. One day, she sees Megan with a man who is not her husband, and a few days later, Megan disappears. Rachel knows she was in the neighborhood the night Megan vanished, but that is all she knows because she was staggeringly drunk at the time. Did she witness something? Or worse...did she do something?Rachel blunders from one stalker-worthy mistake to another, fighting guilt and her own ineffectuality, alternating between days where she actually manages to remain sober, and days of which she has no memory whatsoever. She is pathetic but we can’t help rooting for her because she is just self-aware enough to know that this cannot go on the way it is.I realized whodunit about three chapters before the murderer was revealed, but it didn’t blunt the story’s power because the killer is only part of the problem. The bigger and more human question is how things will end up for Rachel."
1354,Dawn Skiba,"I liked the imagery of the writing. I felt that some of the choices of the characters where a little far fetched but the same could probably said about some of my choices while young and foolish. All in all, it kept me reading and engaged."
1355,Caitlin Yerly,"I really enjoyed this book! I don't know what it says about me that I get so sucked into books that consist of terrible characters...but I do! I guessed who the killer was pretty early on in the book, but that didn't really matter to me because it was still entertaining watching how the other characters figure it out. Overall, I recommend this book to everyone!"
1356,Miss Faulk,"I really did enjoy this book as I found myself listening (yep this one was an audiobook for me) to it every spare second I got. I saw this book compared to ""Gone Girl"", which is not exactly how it should be advertised. It is nothing like Gone Girl, no ""crazy bitch"" moment or ""WTF"" moments, just a great murder story. I actually had it figured out about page 200 it all started to come together, but the ending was great. A book I would tell people to ""read"" if they were interested, but not something I would go out of my way to tell people ""YOU MUST read this"". It seemed to go round and round at points, and it could have been shortened by taking out those moments. It also could have used A LOT more ""Anna"" POV to me, I didn't feel like I heard enough from her. Also, I was left wondering what ever happened to Scott after Rachel made her complaint to the police about him going cray cray on her ass. I would have liked to see that loose end tied up.Good book, but not something that will stay with me until the end of time. "
1357,MorganReadsBooks,"Wow!! I needed some time after finishing this book to sort my thoughts and feelings about this story. But even hours later I'm still just blown away by this novel. The realness that this story portrays is phenomenal. The characters were well developed and this story gripped me from the very beginning. After finishing this story, it made me look at the world differently. I will never again look at someone and assume their lives are all rainbows and sunshine. This story took something we are all guilty of (thinking the grass is always greener somewhere else) and puts it into a context that genuinely makes you want to never make those assumptions again.This book is for mystery, suspense lovers. This book just blew me away, so I say everyone should read it!!"
1358,KatieMc,"4 1/2 stars. There's a reason this is such a popular book this year, it's a good old fashioned page turner. I actually read this earlier this year and I decided to listen to the audio for an upcoming bookclub meeting. I think I enjoyed it more the second time around because it gave me opportunity to study the characters a bit more. TGOTT is ostensibly a who-done-it suspense read, however, it's the characters that make it engaging. Especially Rachel. God bless Rachel, she just can't help herself. I love a good literary drunk. As much as heavy drinking is portrayed in fiction, most authors really don't capture it well. More often than not, characters drink to excess with little or no consequence. Maybe there is mention of a hangover, but rarely do characters drunk dial, break things, or hurt themselves, all common foibles associated with heavy drinking. For anyone who has dealt with alcohol abuse on one way or another (and who hasn't?) you know there is constant struggle, constant regret, and constant rationalization happening. By the way, if you are fortunate enough to have not experienced this, I recommend Drinking: A Love Story.So back to Rachel. Rachel is an alcoholic, and that plays a major role in the book. Even when she's not drinking, her addiction drives her. Some of her decisions and actions are embarrassingly painful to watch. Man oh man, did this author nail Rachel's struggle. On the surface, Rachel is seen as pathetic, washed up, and unstable. Rachel's drinking is fodder for the smugness found in the other characters, especially Anna. This is how everyone perceives Rachel, the quintessential unreliable narrator: But what is really important, for which I applaud the author, is that she does have good qualities and she isn't a lost cause, she is human. I'm not going to go into the mystery or other characters other than to say that they are all pretty unlikable, which for this sort of book is a really good thing."
1359,Crystal,"An easy read and a page turner. For part of it, I was thinking it was a ripoff of ""Gone Girl,"" because there was a missing wife, and the narrative was written in the first person by three characters,jumping around in time. So, when I starting going down one line of thought, I had to reverse after reading the ""flashback."" This is Ms. Hawkins first book; I await her next. "
1360,Miss Kim,"Hmm… A lot of readers will say “ugh, all of the characters were awful, what a terrible book”. I disagree. Aside from the murderer, I found the people actually quite real. The private struggles in each marriage are things that happen to some—infertility, jealousy, alcoholism, adultery, emptiness. I liked Rachel. She’s depressed, spiraling, and an alcoholic. At first I pitied her, but then as her story was revealed, I could understand what happened to her. If you’ve ever had someone close to you that is alcoholic, I feel you could relate to her. Each time she says she will stop, she cannot remember anything, the pity. It is a horrible disease.She becomes obsessed with a couple that lives on her old street. They happen to live a few doors down from her ex-husband and his new wife and baby. She still hasn’t come to terms with the ex leaving her, and moving his new woman in within 4 hours. She begins to fantasize that the neighbors are perfect, that she is the woman, and has the happiest life ever!The author intertwines their lives in a riveting story. I could not put it down! (Aside from the week I broke my kindle and had to order a new one) I had guessed the killer correctly, but not the motivation Great read!Side note: I hated Anna the entire book. What a sniveling, whiney, selfish, mess."
1361,Jordan Wheelock,3.5
1362,Janice,Very suspenseful and hard to put down.
1363,Carla *Jen7waters*,"Wow, this was intense. I still have a mild headache from reading this book like a crazy person yesterday, I legit sat/laid on my bed and read for, like, 5 hours straight--I knew I needed a couple of breaks for snacks and water but I couldn't make myself stop reading, I needed to know what was going to happen next, and next, and after that, chapter after chapter I needed to know if Rachel was OK, and what the hell happened on That Saturday? Why was Rachel all roughed up? Who did that to her? What can't she remember? What happened to Megan? And why? Gods, the heroine, Rachel, is such a flawed&damaged character, a real hot mess, constantly drunk, constantly calling and emailing her ex-husband Tom, constantly showing up at their old house where he now lives with his new perfect wife and perfect baby girl. My goodness, I facepalmed so many times, RACHEL WHY DO YOU DO THIS TO YOURSELF, WHY?? It was depressing and heartbreaking to see her in that state, day after day. Even more so when she lets the reader know how happy she used to be, how great her life was before her marriage started to fall apart, before she started to drink to forget and not feel anything, before her husband started to cheat on her, before the divorce, before the empty, lonely life she lives now.And, grrrr, it's so damn frustrating because, really, no one wants to be around an alcoholic, particularly if you don't understand how or why they can't simply STOP, and I admit I was a little hard on Rachel myself, for a couple of chapters I kept screaming at my ereader: STOP DOING THAT, STOP DRINKING, STOP GETTING HURT, STOP SHOWING UP AT THEIR HOUSE, GO TO AN AA MEETING, GET YOUR LIFE TOGETHER! It's so easy to judge someone with a destructive addiction, but in this case, and as the story progressed, I got more and more invested in cheering for Rachel, because you can tell she's a good person, and even though she's a responsible adult, she didn't get to that point just by herself, there's a great amount of emotional and physical abuse behind it all and it really isn't fair how her life has been in total havoc for the past years, while other people pretend they have nothing to do with it, or worse, pretend that they are victims of this situation, that they're victims of this (quoting and paraphrasing) annoying, sad, pathetic, fat drunker who can't stop harassing her ex and his new family, and now she's even doing it to strangers, Jesus! this woman must be stopped, but I can't say much more because I don't want to spoil this book for anyone.Other thing that struck me deep down was how this person whose life is in shambles, who knows that people look at her with utter contempt and disgust, and who's deeply ashamed by the train wreck that is her situation, still decides to get involved in the investigation of the disappearance of a stranger, Megan Hipwell, a woman she used to see through her window every day when she was on the train. Mostly she wants to help this woman's husband, who she believes is not to blame for this occurrence, and of course she wants to know what happened to Megan--the thing is, to help she has to come clean about her life, and, oh my God, it was painful to watch. Imagine trying so hard to help, trying your best, trying, and in return being treated like a repulsive, hardly worth of a minute of attention, drunk fool who's wasting everyone's time. I'm telling you, AGONY, this woman can not catch a break. On top of wanting to see this mystery of the gone girl solved, and Rachel get her life back on track, I was dying to know what happened during all those alcohol blackouts--more so when it becames clear that one in particular holds the key to the big mystery, and also that someone took advantage of her confusion and repressed memories, so think, Rachel, think! + I couldn't stop thinking about how terrifying it must be to not know what happened to you and around you, to have entire hours of your life erased from your memory, and then you wake up and you're bruised and bloodied, and no idea why. Terrifying. *stops to look at review* Whoa, this is long. Okay, I'm going to wrap it up now.This book was a wild ride, utterly gripping and unputdownable, both because of the mystery surrounding Megan, and also because you want to see Rachel succeed, be safe, change her life. I highly recommend it. (This is going to be a movie too!) "
1364,Miss Melly,"My review contains spoilers.This was a promising read but fell flat in a couple of places and left one main question unanswered. (Here's the spoiler)... Who leaked the information about the big issue with Mac? It is a major event in the story, yet the search to find out who told the media is dropped without explanation. Leaving a loose end like that is a bit messy.My other issue is the characterisation of the current wife - her persona is erratically depicted - she starts out as a kind of perfect mother and then becomes a vindictive she-wolf. It must did t ring true for me.That said, there is a lot going for this novel. The main character is wonderfully drawn and the plot moves along at a good pace. A great first novel with the best yet to come."
1365,Kelsey Hanson,"This was one of those books that you have to remind yourself to stop for eating and sleeping. It was quite addicting. The mystery itself was very interesting and the pacing reveals pieces of information slowly so you're constantly wanting to read ""one more chapter."" The characters were complicated and not 100% good or bad."
1366,Mrs. Joseph,I enjoyed this fast-paced tale of desperation and conflicted souls. Very reminiscent of Gone Girl and almost as equally compelling. I am never good at predicting outcomes of murder mysteries so I enjoyed following this one until the end. The story is not at all uplifting so would only recommend to those who are not at all faint of heart. 
1367,Bridget Belcastro,"I thought it started slow. But couldn't put it down. I figured it out early, but it was still great. "
1368,Alli Brooks,"This was really fast paced and unputdownable. However, the ending was a bit underwhelming. So much built up and then it just hit a plateau. "
1369,Maria (Big City Bookworm),"Alrighty, so I've just read another book with an extreme amount of hype surrounding it. The Girl on the Train has been compared to Gone Girl in almost every single review or article I've seen about this book. Although I did see a lot of similarities between the two, I felt as though The Girl on the Train was a mixture of Gone Girl, another Gillian Flynn novel; Dark Places and Into the Darkest Corner by Elizabeth Haynes. The Girl on the Train is told from three different female character's perspectives: Rachel, Megan & Anna. The story opens up with Rachel riding a public train to and from work everyday where she has created a fictitious life for a couple living in a house close to the tracks. Things get a little complicated once Rachel witnesses something while looking out of the train window.The comparisons to Gone Girl begin when a main character goes missing and the story becomes a search for the missing woman. Other similarities include the idea of her husband being responsible for her disappearance as well as characters that are not particularly likable. The comparisons I've found in relation to Dark Places include the way the story was told in three different perspectives while also jumping timelines. Comparisons to Into The Darkest Corner by Elizabeth Haynes might be a tad bit spoiler-ish so I'm not going to go into it, but hopefully those who have read it understand where I'm coming from.Overall, this thriller was good and I thoroughly enjoyed it! Was it as shocking as I had hoped? Not really. Was it as dark as a Gillian Flynn novel? It had its moments, but I would say no (especially when compared to Dark Places & Sharp Objects).I think readers will enjoy this book more so if they do not compare it to Gone Girl. (view spoiler)[ I will say though that this ending was a lot more satisfying than the ending to Gone Girl.  (hide spoiler)]"
1370,Book Concierge,"Book on CD narrated by Clare Corbett, Louise Brealey and India Fisher.Rachel rides the same train each day from her flat in a suburb of London into the city for her job, and back again. As she passes one particular suburban neighborhood she becomes fixated on a couple she sees having breakfast on their deck. She gives them names – Jason and Jess – and invents perfectly happy lives for them. One day she sees the couple kissing … but it’s not Jason, it’s another man with Jess. A few days later Rachel reads a news report about a missing woman; the picture of Megan Hipwell is “Jess.” What a wild ride – gripping and fascinating. The novel is told in alternating points of view, and moving back and forth in time. We have three distinct narrators: Rachel, Megan and Anna whose lives converge around the two men: Tom (Rachel’s ex, and Anna’s current husband), and Scot (Megan’s husband). We learn early about Rachel’s alcoholic fugues and black-outs, her inability to remember, her warped thought processes. Clearly she is an unreliable narrator. But as we hear from Megan and Anna, and their secrets, we begin to doubt whether any of the characters can be trusted to tell the truth. I was guessing right up to the reveal, and the ending is nothing short of chilling. The audio is capably narrated by three voice artists: Clare Corbett, Louise Brealey and India Fisher. But I have no way of knowing who voices which character. Frankly, they sound very much alike to me and if Hawkins hadn’t started each chapter with the narrating character’s name, and the voice artists hadn’t read those chapter titles, I think I would have been completely lost. Still the pace of the narration was good."
1371,Adrienne,"I give this 4 stars. I liked the book, it sucked me in from the beginning and oddly enough I was able to relate with most of the female characters. However I was able to predict the ending, or the killer. it was still a great read a few parts I wish had been on expanded on but all in all I did enjoy this. it also looks like a fantastic audible book, almost wish I had listened rather than read this one. I would recommend both versions."
1372,Mandy Rich,"The book definitely caught my attention and I wanted to finish it - this doesn't always happen with novels! I found the protagonist interesting and relatable, however the other two women in the story (Anna and Megan), I thought were more narcissistic and vapid. Even so, I loved the story itself (even if it is somewhat misogynistic at the end)."
1373,Khaoula, 3.5 stars Video review coming up soon (hopefully)
1374,Emma,"I really enjoyed this book and felt empathy for Rachel and Anna, although none of the characters aren't particularly nice people. I liked the style of the book using different pov's but I would of liked to see the pov from Scott and Tom just to give it it an extra edge"
1375,Beth Jusino,"Finally caught up with this one after months (years?) of hype, then read it in a single day while sick on the couch. This book is perfect for that: it's quick and suspenseful without being too complicated or deep. The characters are all messy and imperfect, which I appreciated, though the ending was a little too neat. Nothing life-shattering, but a pleasant escape."
1376,Terri,"Paula Hawkins uses a unique approach in her debut thriller. The main character ,Rachel, has a troubled past and over active imagination. What she observes from her seat on the commuter train drives the action and plot in this thriller..This is a must read for lovers of the thriller genre. "
1377,Clarabel,"Tant de buzz autour de ce livre... et la volonté d'apprécier ce que la lecture me réserverait, coûte que coûte. J'ai donc zappé les avis qui circulaient déjà en masse pour me consacrer sereinement à cette histoire qui est dans l'air du temps (une narratrice peu fiable, une intrigue nébuleuse, le coup de théâtre final).Toute la force du roman vient - selon moi - des trois intervenantes dans l'histoire, dont les rôles interchangeables viennent complètement troubler notre perception de l'intrigue. On ne cerne plus la plus crédible ou la plus coupable des trois et c'est assez perturbant. Cela compense aussi avec le peu d'action dans notre affaire, qui tient la distance grâce à une pression psychologique constante et finement jouée. J'ai certes vu venir la fin, mais ai attendu jusqu'au point final pour obtenir toutes les réponses. Qu'on aime ou pas, cela reste une lecture redoutable sur un plan machiavélique, et efficace pour le climat lourd, suspicieux et tendu de bout en bout."
1378,Ashly,"I admit, it probably took me a little longer than it should have to figure this one out. I kept going back and forth in my theories - Megan, Rachel, Scott, the therapist, Rachel, Anna, Rachel, Megan, Anna and Tom, Rachel, Scott, Rachel... And I was thisclose to getting frustrated with the pace and screaming for an answer already when things started to become clear. Even though not one character in this book was likable, the book itself definitely was. "
1379,Peggy,"This book had me from the first page. Although it's not great literature, it's a page-turner. Three-quarters of the way through the book, I realized who the murderer was, but I read to the end. A good summer read."
1380,Terry,"This is the same suspense genre as Gone Girl and The Memory Box - so far, much better than the Memory Box. I'm listening to the Audible version and the female narrators are very good. Rachel is a girl on the train, commuting back and forth each day to work. She gazes out the window each day and fantasizes about the people she sees as the train goes past their houses and backyards. She looks at the house she used to share with her husband, who now lives there with his new wife and sees pale pink curtains in the 2nd bedroom window, signifying a baby girl, and gets tears in her eyes while sitting on the train. She also sees a couple she names ""Jason and Jess"", sitting outside on their deck having coffee or drinks a few doors down from the other house. She wishes she was them. Then one day she sees ""Jess"" passionately kissing another man....2/25/15Just finished this excellent book! I thought it was great, suspenseful throughout the entire story. Rachel is a flawed, somewhat unreliable narrator, but I always felt sympathetic towards her personally. The other two protagonists were both women and we heard from their perspectives on alternate chapters, but I felt they didn't grow from their experiences, against all odds, the same way Rachel did. It is about a series of love triangles, with a sinister twist, and a very satisfying ending. That's all I can say without giving anything away. Very well written, the author really gets into the mind of her characters."
1381,Adele,Like I told the friend who loaned it to me ... this book is weirdly addicting.

2015 Reading Challenge: A mystery or thriller (14/50)

LOL THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH GONE GIRL WTF GUYS
*a-hem*I wanted to read this book because I thought it was gonna be a good read. Then I read some reviews about it and many of the reviews kept comparing this book to Gone Girl.

BUT THEY ARE NOTHING ALIKE!!!!! THE ONLY THING IT HAS IN COMMON IS THAT IT'S A MYSTERY/THRILLER, BUT THAT'S IT!!!!! IF YOU HATED GONE GIRL, YOU MIGHT STILL LIKE THIS!!!

So, NOW that this is out of the way... let's begin the actual review.The story is told in 3 point of views: Rachel's, Anna's and Megan's.Rachel is an alcoholic who lost her job and was cheated on by her husband, who then left her for the new girl.Anna is the bitch was the mistress, is now the wife of Rachel's ex-husband and has a daughter, Eve, who is but a baby.Megan used to be Eve's babysitter and is Anna's neighbour.Rachel had nowhere else to live, so she asked a College's Acquaintance if she could live with her until she sorts things out. Her acquaintance doesn't know that she's jobless as well, so Rachel takes the train everyday to ""go to work"" so she doesn't suspect a thing, and that's how it begins. Everytime she looks out of the window, she sees a house with a husband and a wife. They seem happy and at peace, and since her own life is a mess, she starts to create a life in her head for them. she calls them 
""Jess and Jason""
.Until one day, she sees something she's not supposed to see. And instead of keeping it to herself, she decides to tell it to the police. She gets involved.That's pretty much all I can say without saying any spoilers, though :PThe Girl on the Train was a fun read. It wasn't spectacular like I was expecting, but it wasn't boring either. Some parts were better than others, but overall it was easy enough to keep reading. The thrilling parts were stronger towards the end, and I must say that I didn't see it coming. I should, because once you find out what happened, you think ""HOW DIDN'T I REALIZE THIS BEFORE????"" :P"
1383,Isabelle,"4.25 StarsSo this was not what I was expecting. Very addicting with an intriguing plot and very annoying, irritating messed up characters. Ending was a bit flat as it was a little obvious as to the whole mystery and everything, but overall a thrilling, compelling read. I recommend :)"
1384,Rochelle Walker,"really enjoyed this. kept me guessing.i find it interesting that so many people took issue with the characters. they are *absolutely* often unlikable, selfish, messes - but that's what rings so true. don't we all have some semblance to this? in our hearts of hearts, aren't we all imperfect, selfish, self-absorbed and even depraved a times? come on. lets be real. i think it's brave to write a story that tells of human nature so unflinchingly. we might not be just like the characters, but we've all had those sorts of moments. i liked that i didn't like the characters. i liked that i often flinched at their thoughts and actions; it was like reading someone's diary. someone said it perfectly: while i didn't always like the characters, i loved the book. YES."
1385,Arlene,"I admit it, I am one of those people who enjoy looking into houses where the blinds are open at night and you can see people watching tv or reading a book. The person my late mother in law feared as she religiously closed her blinds every evening the minute twilight appeared!! This book will make you think twice about such a thing!! Three women are featured in this mystery...Rachel, the jilted wife turned alcoholic who has lost her job but continues to ride the train into London each day; Anna, Tom's new wife and mother of his child who is fearful of Rachel and finally Megan, a rather lost soul who cannot seem to get her life together. Anna and Tom continue to live in the house that Tom shared with Rachel and Rachel feels compelled to look at her old home each time she rides by it on the train. In looking at her old home, she sees the perfect couple who live down the street, Scott and Megan. The couple that she and Tom were before Anna. But as with many of our perceptions Rachel is dead wrong. When Megan turns up missing, Rachel feels she must work to find out what happened. I will say that of all three women, I liked Rachel the best. Even though she was her own worst enemy, you could see the good heart that was there. Anna seemed rather annoying to me and Megan was just a character that I could not identify with at all. This book will keep you reading and pulling for the women to find out what exactly happened to Megan!!"
1386,Annie,"A seriously great psychological thriller. For fans of Gone Girl - just as well-written and surprising, with similar uncomfortable truths about love, addiction, and perception weaving through the narrative, despite its genre. But, with a VERY different ending from any Gillian Flynn, so don't think it's more of the same. "
1387,Karolyn Sherwood,"THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN, by Paula Hawkins is a whodunit-beachread. If you want a mystery to devour, this is the book for you. If you liked Gone Girl, this is the book for you. Because that's exactly what this is: Gone Girl fan fiction. I'm sure the use of the word ""Girl"" in the title was intentional. I won't say I disliked this book, but I will say it's derivative. Rachel is the girl who rides the train (to and from London) each day to a non-existant job. She was fired because she's an alcoholic. Perhaps Hawkins was trying to say something about the evils of alcohol, or perhaps she just needed an excuse to make the protagonist an unreliable narrator. Now, I like unreliable narrators, but Rachel's talk of acquiring/drinking/recovering from her alcoholic binges became tedious over the first fifty pages. It wasn't until page 54 (I read the ebook version) that this story got rolling. That's when Megan, the woman that Rachel ""stalks"" from her train window each day, went missing. What I liked best about The Girl On The Train was that I couldn't guess who was responsible for Megan's disappearance. A good whodunit has to keep the reader guessing—and this did! Hawkins also threw in a few poignant and insightful lines that I loved. My favorite was something ""Megan"" realized while in therapy: ""... the holes in your life are permanent. You have to grow around them, like tree roots around concrete ..."" I believe that to be true, yet I'd never thought of it that way.Unfortunately, I felt Rachel was an unrealistic character, even taking her alcoholism into account. She inserts herself into the mess of solving the crime (I imagine most alcoholics would be too self-centered to go to the trouble). She makes unrealistic decisions (like the idiots in horror movies; you get the picture) that totally frustrated me. But maybe I expect too much ...Three and a half Stars (rounded to four because I can recommend this to my friends who want an exciting book but aren't as critical as I am)."
1388,Elizabeth Berry,"Great Story But...The story itself is well written however, I was thoroughly sick of the main character's drinking problems. Aside from that, the only thing I didn't like about this story was the fact that the characters were unlikable people, every single one of them. The ending does have a good twist which I enjoyed. It would depend upon the person I was talking to whether or not I'd recommend this book. If it's just a good story you're after and you don't mind the characters all being pathetic, then I would say read and enjoy."
1389,Dana,"Popularity is a problem for me. Movies, books ... it doesn't matter, if I hear something is great, I go in with high expectations and often feel let down. On the other hand, if I hear something is terrible, I am just as likely to come away pleasantly surprised. So I try not to listen - and with this book I tried very hard, but from my peripheral vision I knew that people were talking about this book. That bothered me a little, but I went ahead anyway.With that said, I had some trouble reading it ... I didn't really like the main character - actually, none of the characters were very likable to me. They were extremely well written, however - this book begins less the mystery I was expecting and more of a study of the characters, their missteps and self-deceptions, and how these come together to form a mystery. In the middle of the book I was afraid that it wouldn't come together - Rachel seemed to much a mess - but it did, and I closed the book on the last page feeling pretty good about the journey. Warning: not a single healthy relationship in this book. Everyone is more concerned with themselves than others, not willing to give others the benefit of the doubt, or a sociopath. so if you are less than happy with your fellow man at the moment, hold off on reading this book till you are in a more positive state of mind."
1390,Jason,"I think if it hadn't been the holiday season I would've had more time to just sit down with this book and have it take up all of my time--but it didn't happen that way. The point is--this book was good. And definitely was good for filling the ""I finally read GONE GIRL, what should I read next"" need that I had.Every once in a while I stare off at some train passengers, and even more rare if I'm on an above ground subway. Maybe I won't look out the window the same way again...who knows.But the book was good. Definitely left me guessing. Do pick this one up when it comes out in January!"
1391,Meadow,"Very reminiscent of Gone Girl. Horrible people, good writing and story. "
1392,Nancy Stewart,"Wow! 4.5 stars. I just finished listening to this on Audible.com. It's almost 2 in the morning and I'm wide awake. What a great story! It took me back to some of the very best of the Hitchcock thrillers. Every character in the novel is flawed in some way, some more than others. Their lives intertwine in so many ways and it kept me guessing (almost) until the very end. If you are looking for a good old fashioned suspenseful page turner, take this train ride! I'll be looking for more books by Paula Hawkins. And by the way, the narration on this audiobook is superb. "
1393,Steve,"very good. very suspenseful. the story is told from 3 characters points of view, each speaking in the 1st person, and moves back and forth from present to the past, so i was a little confused in the beginning, but each chapter is named for the person who is talking so once i started paying attention i had no problem. "
1394,Eric Peterson,"As a standard whodunnit, it was nicely executed; I was surprised at several of the turns the story took, including the last big reveal. What intrigued me even more was the conceit of three first-person narrators, all of them deeply flawed. I wouldn't want to befriend any of them in life, but peering into their lives was fascinating. And it's always a nice reminder that you have no idea just how wretched a person's life may be, no matter how perfect it may seem from a comfortable distance. "
1395,Book Junkie,"Usually, I guess the ending halfway through. Not this one, not until the last couple of chapters. Up until that point, my list of suspects just kept growing. I've heard this compared to Gone Girl and for once I agree with the comparison. Loved the multiple perspectives. "
1396,Todd,"This book was really good and......really creepy. Innovative story telling that readily kept my interest. And I do wish they would stop calling it the next ""Gone Girl"". There are similarities I suppose and I agree with someone's review about neither book having one likeable character but I think it does this novel a disservice by making the comparison. This book has more of a Hitchcock feel and a cleverness that doesn't exist in GG. Highly recommended."
1397,Graham,"Age of the unreliable narratorFun little read. The narrator is so unreliable that it kept me guessing loss of different scenarios--frankly, more complex and interesting ones than what it actually turned out to be. Still, I enjoyed the story. "
1398,Lorna Adams,"When I started this book I had my doubts I would finish it. I'm glad I didn't give up, but it does take patience to read if you prefer your books a bit more fast paced. It builds up quite slowly, I enjoy books that get straight in there, so this was quite a challenge for me. What I did love about the book though is it does keep you guessing and I lost count how many times I changed my mind about who I thought the guilty person was. I suspected different characters in certain parts of the book, that's what made me carry on reading. I felt quite close to Megan, which did leave me feeling sad at a certain point in the story, I certainly didn't see that coming out about her past. I have marked the book 4 stars due to the slow build up. I think we can all relate to Rachel though regarding looking out the train window! I certainly do what she does when I travel by train."
1399,Avigail,"THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN is a dark, haunting and depressing psychological thriller, but it's incredibly effective thanks to the writing skills of author Paula Hawkins. This rather bleak story with intersecting timelines is told from the viewpoint of three different women Rachel, Anne and Megan. All the women are unreliable narrators with something to hide. In fact, most of the characters in this novel, including the men, lack veracity, and are a self-serving and unsympathetic group with plenty of skeletons in their closets. Lest I continue and divulge too much of the plot, let me just say that the twists and turns in the story are many and readers will be easily drawn in, making it easy to devour this book. I'd definitely encourage you to read this book and formulate your own opinions. So many people have absolutely loved it in its entirety, and been shocked by the way everything transpires, so perhaps you will as well. I think for the most part, this is a pretty great book, and I look forward to seeing what comes next in Hawkins' career."
1400,Bronwyn,"Fast read. This is billed as, ""If you liked Gone Girl, you'll love The Girl on the Train."" Yes, it was really good and had my heart pumping at the end, but it took a long time to get to the twisted part. It kept me guessing all the way through, however, and I do recommend it."
1401,Joanna Williams,It was a little slow to get into but once I got to the good part I couldn't put it down and the ending was great! Highly recommend. 
1402,Imran Said,"Picked up this book at the airport to keep myself occupied on the long flight to Doha. Perhaps its a testament to the strength of the novel as a thriller and murder mystery that I managed to finish it in one sitting. Its absolutely gripping, and with enough twist and turns to make you impatient to found out who did it. One particular fascinating aspect of this novel is that almost everyone in this book, with the probably exception of Rachel's overly nice housemate, is an awful human being. Some, such as the protagonist Rachel (an alcoholic washup with almost no direction in life) may be slightly better morally and in deeper character than others (such as Megan, Rachel's 'Jesse,' or Anna, Rachel's husband's new wife). As we progress through the book, and we dig deeper into the characters, even the characters we thought initially came off as kind-hearted we soon discover to have much darker, often shocking, secrets and character flaws. Another thing which is interesting about this novel is the ability of the author to weave all the lives of the seemingly unconnected characters into one larger narrative. Initially, what makes the book initially fascinating to me was that it seemed to concern a protagonist with seemingly no prior involvement in the live's of this particular couple suddenly being forced into it by sheer coincidence (in this case having passed by their house everyday on the subway). However, as we progress through the story we discover often surprising connections between the characters which only makes the story more gripping insofar that it makes the story both clearer and paradoxically raises more question, thus forcing you to continue reading!Since the author is female, it probably makes sense that this novel is written purely from the perspectives of almost all the female protagonists in the story. This unique writing style allows us to to continuously flesh out the story by analyzing particular events through the memories of each character involved, using their experiences to fully understand what had happened, rather than being forced to rely on solely one character's experiences as more traditional novels may have done. This becomes important when we later discover how certain protagonists can be unreliable witnesses. Indeed, with Rachel, who's such an alcoholic mess, this is crucial for the reader to get a better grip of important events in the story. Overall, this is a dark story, and anyone hoping for more uplifting material would be advised to stay away from this. However, for people who enjoy the occasional dark murder mystery with well done twists and turns, happy reading! "
1403,Tweedledum,Murder in Subburbia.A fast paced domestic thriller that moves in a linear way backwards and forwards in time much like the train that travels past the homes or former homes of the protagonists. The author keeps us guessing as she unpacks her characters personalities and histories as to who has actually done what. There are no heroes or heroines here. Only victims. If like me you've lived in a house that backs into a railway line you will recognise the way in which it's easy to get used to and discount this daily casual invasion of privacy and appreciate a well crafted story around this. 
1404,Jaden Wilkes,"I'd say 3.5 because it felt a tad slow in places, and some of it didn't quite add up for me. I found I didn't connect with or GAF about any of the characters. "
1405,Magistra,"I spent the whole book, knowing something was wrong, but couldn't figure out what is was. Ms. Hawkins successfully takes the reader on a wild ride of blackouts, lost memories, haunting pasts, and the pain of facing reality all wrapped up in one of the best thrillers I've read this past year."
1406,Christine Bongers,"Not a single likeable character in the entire book but one heck of a page-turner. Told from the perspectives of three female characters who have made train wrecks of their lives, I found it hard to look away. Which made it an excellent read on the plane."
1407,Jacquelyn,"I have owned this book for a while now (found it at a library sale for $1) but I was always hesitant to start it. I've never really delved into adult fiction but when my coblogger and one of my best bookish friends, Audris, texted me to say she was starting this, I knew I had to read it with her. I picked it up and oh boy, am I so glad I did.It definitely wasn't hard to read like I was anticipating. It read like a bit more mature YA mystery which I really enjoyed. It moved very quickly and there were always new discoveries being made that kept me glued to the pages. I really enjoyed the multiple point of views and timelines. I felt like they were necessary for this story line and it definitely made the book better. Each point of view was able to be differentiated and each person had a different voice, which I definitely appreciated. The timeline was a bit confusing at times (different times/months/years) so I kept having to check the dates but that is a minor complaint looking back on the entirety of it.This book was definitely a great book to buddy read. All day Audris and I were texting each other and reading the same chapter simultaneously so we could throw out theories and discuss. Audris is such an amazing person to buddy read with, but especially with mystery novels. She is always so on top of everything and she actually figured out the mystery. Once she texted me, it was so fun to put all of of the pieces together.I wasn't expecting the ending so it totally took me off guard but I really enjoyed it. My one complaint is these character's actions. I questioned basically every single thing they did. It felt as if they had no common sense and I understand that Rachel was an unreliable character but I am talking about ALL of the characters. I wanted to scream at them and ask where their brain went during all of this!Overall, an enjoyable mystery novel that had me glued to the pages. Definitely would recommend!"
1408,Pandora Black,"Ça se lit donc très vite (parce que ce sont de courts chapitres et que l'envie de savoir est très motivante ^^).Je comprends les comparaisons avec Gone Girl, même si les histoires sont très différentes, on retrouve le narrateur peu fiable et les apparences trompeuses... après il faut aimer se laisser manipuler et se prendre au jeu, mais c'était tout à fait ce dont j'avais besoin après plusieurs jours où j'étais moyennement motivée par ce que je lisais !"
1409,Mariana,"Apesar de ter acertado à primeira na pessoa responsável pelo crime, mesmo assim arrepiei-me com todos os contornos relacionados com a situação chave da história. Gostei particularmente da forma como o narrador nos desarmava por completo com afirmações inesperadas. Uma leitura interessante!"
1410,Imogen,"This book was one of those truly fantastic psychological thrillers that comes along only very rarely. I devoured this audiobook. It was great to finally end a reading slump I'd been in with such an addictive book. A book that is so annoyingly addictive that it's almost painful when you have to stop reading so that you can do things, like have a life: work, sleep, etc. People have been comparing this to Gone Girl quite a bit, and I can see what they mean, however, this is quite different. Similarities include an unreliable narrator and that it's an addictive psychological thriller. Otherwise, it's quite different. This book has three different narrators, all sharing their points of view, from different points of time. I really enjoyed this, and particularly like that the audiobook had three different narrators for each character. I found one of the speakers to have a particularly annoying, grating voice, another to have quite an irritating, husky voice, but luckily for me, I really enjoyed the main speaker. I know this is mostly personal preference, but it can certainly have an impact on how I feel about an audiobook.The main narrator of the story is Rachel. One is led to feel sorry for Rachel as she is suffering a lot of depression and anguish from her recent divorce. Her husband left her for another woman and she lost everything: her house, her husband and her dream life. As the story goes on, we learn more and more about Rachel's past. This act of not lying to the reader, but withholding information is something can be done really badly, or really well. Paula Hawkins nailed it. You can tell that there is something slightly off about Rachel from the beginning, and we soon learn that Rachel is currently battling a drinking problem. This is a brilliant way for the author to have an unreliable narrator, as Rachel suffers from black outs after her excessive drinking. So not only is she sometimes withholding information, but other times, she really just cannot remember what happened.A similar thing goes for the other two characters. Certain things are withheld for a while, until the reader slowly starts to piece things together. It was amazing.A lot of these characters are not very nice, but you also feel sorry for them. Anna, the woman that Rachel's husband left her for, is at first obviously seen as the enemy. We feel sorry for Rachel as this woman came in and ruined her life. However, as certain things come undone, we start to feel slightly sorry for Anna.I really didn't pick any of the things that happen throughout the book, so was pleasantly surprised with the outcome of everything, particularly the ending. There is certainly a build up to the climax, as the story shifts between narrators and dates. As the days go on and Rachel is trying to piece together what happened to Megan, while Megan's point of view gets closer and closer to the date she went missing.I really couldn't recommend this book enough, I absolutely loved it. I have been trying to find a similar book to read since, but have had no luck!I am eagerly awaiting any other book that Paula Hawkins publishes, because WOW. That woman can write!"
1411,Amanda,"Everyone is all a-buzz about this book, and I totally understand why. It's compelling and oh so hard to put down. I read it over the course of two afternoons and was mad each time I had to stop. A couple of things:-I hate all the main characters, which is never a book turn-off for me. I actually like it better when I hate the characters. It's impossible to like Rachel. Every thing she does is cringe-worthy and I found myself constantly congratulating myself on my good life choices as she fell further and further down the rabbit hole. Megan is impossible to like for so many reasons, although you sort of want to at the beginning. Anna is just a bitch, obviously.-I figured out the twist about halfway through. It was the way something was worded that gave it away to me.-The writing is what made the book. I think it would have been just another thriller if it wasn't for the nuanced characters and careful plotting.-Unlike so many people complained about with Gone Girl (I LIKED THE ENDING, SO SUE ME), the end is totally satisfying. That's not a spoiler, just a fact. This is a spoiler: (view spoiler)[OMG the corkscrew...Go Anna!! (hide spoiler)]"
1412,Sandeep Sharma,"Slow with buildup but the climax is exceptional. The presentation of the book is something that is unique. The way, the story is narrated by the author makes this book a must read. "
1413,Sasha,Everyone keeps saying that the culprit was easy to figure out but I didn't know until the end. Very strong audiobook and highly recommend to those looking for a thriller. I can definitely see the Gone Girl similarities but felt more of a connection with these cringe-worthy characters. 
1414,Emily Virgin,"I really loved this book. Although none of the characters were particularly likable in the traditional sense, I came to like Rachel and root for her. She was SO frustrating at times, but in the end, I still liked her. I have to admit that I had no idea how or why Megan disappeared until the very end of the book when it was finally revealed. Maybe I'm naive, but I have to think others had the same experience. Highly recommended this book, but beware - it's one of those that you just can't put down. I can definitely see this one being turned into a movie. "
1415,Cari,"Raise your hand if you love books that royally screw with your mind and have really twisted, unstable characters that make you cringe and question all of humanity... Both of my hands are raised high and I'm jumping up and down saying ""ME! I do!"". I can't help but adore books that royally screw with my mind and have really twisted, unstable characters that make me cringe and question all of humanity... because they are so damn fun! I hate to be like everyone else and describe The Girl on the Train as a faster-paced, more suspenseful Gone Girl, but that's actually a pretty good way to describe it. What I mean is that if you liked Gone Girl, you will love The Girl on the Train. Neither book is ""pretty"" and are at times awfully disturbing. Hawkins also seems to share Flynn's talent for creating really unlikable, nasty characters and having the story play out in their unstable, untrustworthy points-of-view. So I get it if these books aren't for everyone, which is why I wanted to make the claim that Gillian Flynn fans will have their socks rocked off by The Girl on the Train.  Despite similarities, these books are each very unique in terms of plot and will keep you guessing until the very end. I mentioned that books like this make me distrust people in general and although it's unsettling, it's kind of part of the appeal and suspense. You could ride the elevator with people just like these characters every day... or sit by them in church... or sleep next to them every night... *shivers*. Rachel, the main character in The Girl on the Train obsesses over a young couple whose house is passed by the train she rides every day. She fixates on them, imagines intimate details of their lives. I don't live by train tracks, but still... Creepy to think about being on a stranger's mind like that. *again with the shivers*. And on a final random thought, I've always been a litttle in love with the roar and whistle of a passing train. Imagining the sound really added to the reading experience for me, but I'm probably the only weirdo who did that. :) Loved having my mind messed with by The Girl on the Train!☆☆☆☆"
1416,Gill Chivas,I enjoyed this one. It took me a wee bit to get into it but by then end I couldn't put it down. It reminded me a little bit of a Gillian Flynn novel with flawed not very likeable characters. Very good for a debut novel though
1417,Anna Consor,"Before I read the comments, I thought to myself ""This reminds me a lot of Gone Girl."" Turns out, a lot of other people thought the same thing! The beginning was a little slow but once Megan/Jess disappeared, it started to get very good and I couldn't put it down. I listened to the audio book and the readers were very good. "
1418,Karla Velázquez,"Bueno, me gustó este libro... es diferente a lo que leo pero definitivamente merece la pena. En general durante toda la lectura sientes ese ambiente sombrío, con todos los personajes; sientes el misterio y la ansiedad por saber quién es el que lo hizo. El personaje de Rachel es interesante, creo que aunque se pueda pensar que es patético la forma en que ve el mundo es real y aunque depresiva realmente me llegó. También los otros personajes son buenos y todos tienen ese lado donde puedes odiarlos pero sabes que no puedes juzgarlos.De lo único que me podría quejar sería el final, fue entre apresurado y no creo que despertara tanto la emoción que me esperaba. Lo confieso, había leído el spoiler del final, así que esperaba que todo fuera más fuerte y creíble, no sé creo que fue bastante flojo y en algunas partes no entendía el porque. Por eso las cuatro estrellas.Ahora, creo que leeré Perdida. Era de esperarse que lo leyera primero, pero siempre es bueno jugar con eso. Y definitivamente espero como estará la película, será interesante. Sí, sí. "
1419,Linovariel,"I enjoyed this book a lot more than I had originally anticipated. I found the main character, Rachel, to be very annoying, mainly because I have very little sympathy for alcoholics who worsen their own situation. I also thought it was absolutely ridiculous that she wanted to be involved with something so beyond her understanding, and I found the absolute faith she had in the fantasies she created, in the face of evidence that literally no one is who she thought them to be, aggravating. All this said, the plot had me hooked. I wanted to know what was in the black spots in Rachel's memory. I wanted to know what happened to Megan. I trudged through my dislike of Rachel, and it was absolutely worth it. The story was great, and once the plot picks up it was a breeze to read. It's a fantastic read, and I'm sure there are plenty of people who wouldn't be as annoyed with Rachel as I was. 4/5 stars, it was an enjoyable read, but the dragging caused by Rachel's alcoholism certainly impaired a lot of my enjoyment."
1420,Wilma Larsson,"This book was better than I expected. I thought it was just going to be another thriller about a husband murdering his wife or something close to that. The mystery of the book, or the “thrilling” part, was actually pretty basic. Happy married couples. Crazy ex wife. Children. Cheating. This was all something I did expect, but what I really enjoyed was getting into Rachel’s head and experiencing the alcoholic that she was. How she just couldn't resist a drink and how the disappearance of Megan made her feel like she had a purpose in life again. It made me understand alcoholism a lot better than I previously did. I also enjoyed all the different relationships and how they all intertwined really well, some more than others, but that’s to be expected!I didn't actually predict the ending at first, which is unusual for me, so plus points to Paula Hawkins for great writing. I've also seen this book compared to Gone Girl, which is a book I never managed to finish because it was just too damned slow, so another plus point there. I, however, think that this book is probably more suited for people who are just starting out in the thriller genre or for someone who just want a quick, light read because for some reason I could not put this book down."
1421,Puja,"Oh but how I love unreliable narrators. Divisive as this book seems to be, I have to say I loved the way in which the author walked the fine line with her characters."
1422,Emily Goode,"A friend described this book as a ""bucket full of crazy"" and I would have to agree. But given that I like bucket-full-of-crazy books, I really enjoyed this. "
1423,Kirk Williamson,"Gone Girl definitely sparked my interest in modern day thrillers, and Hawkins was able to keep that spark alive. The haunting malice of suspicion is the central theme of the story, a large theme of many thrillers, if not explicitly stated. With an unreliable, alcoholic protagonist, grappling with life's vicissitudes on a train back and forth to London, it's extremely exhilarating to progress throughout this book amidst belief and disbelief. Feel sorry for Rachel, connect with Rachel, despise Rachel, that's for you to decide, which is a compelling component of this read. You'll be shocked by the plot twists and the continual thwarts Rachel inflicts upon herself due in part to her destructive lifestyle.Honestly, I was in the midst of finals when I read this book and still couldn't put it down. Every break I took, every night before falling asleep, I had to know more. I hope you find yourself on the same seat as me, opposite of Rachel, wondering what the hell is going on. "
1424,Michelle Turlock isler,"The Girl On The Train was a very good thriller. It can become a little confusing at times so I suggest reading it in a quiet place. Pay attention to the story and you will definitely find yourself flipping back through the book and checking if you read that correctly. It is exciting and builds up the pace even though there in an underlying somber tone throughout the novel. You can definitely label it a Thriller. There is a young lady that takes the train into work everyday. She passes by the same homes, every morning and evening. After witnessing a horrific crime, she finds her life turned upside down. There are many story lines intertwining through the novel and they all build up to a gigantic climax. I do not want to give anything away so I will keep the review as vague as possible. "
1425,Donna,"I chose the audio version of this book since I have a long commute to and from work, and it was just what I needed to make the commute ""shorter"". Suspenseful and an excellent mystery, it kept me engaged as a reader till the very end. Each character/narrator was clearly drawn, and I especially loved that the main protagonist, Rachel, was so undependable due to her drinking - it added another level of difficulty in solving the mystery. Loved this book!"
1426,Beth ,"Riverhead is doing a great marketing job for this book, right down to its very clever cover. But, reader, be warned: after all this hype, THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN may disappoint. While it will keep your attention, it probably won't be as unputdownable as claimed until the last couple of chapters. It wasn't for me.The girl on the train is Rachel. She's a raging alcoholic who has opinions about people that are often based on nothing and are always wrong. The entire book is about her alcoholic blackouts and figuring out what really happened. Some things about this book are aggravating. For instance, during tense moments, characters, especially Rachel, bite their lips, often so hard they draw blood. I could just imagine all the people walking around with bloody mouths they had chewed.The biggest aggravation is difficult to describe without saying too much and spoiling the story. It has to do with how everything is explained in the end. It really wouldn't happen that way and is too hard to swallow.Yet, even considering these and other faults, the book still rates four stars. That is simply because it kept my attention more than books I've rated with three stars.I won this ARC from the publisher and librarything.com."
1427,Myra,"I had every intention of reading a few chapters before bedtime...Now, I find myself at 5 a.m., with only 20 pages remaining!(Updated Review: 16 hours after finishing, and still thinking about it.)I became so utterly immersed in this story, I just could not stop reading. I HAD to know what happened, I found myself questioning each person involved at some point or another!My only regret is, not my lost/lack of sleep, but that it is over.I truly hope that Paula Hawkins is currently weaving another incredible story!I received this book from a GoodReads giveaway!"
1428,Fräulein Pusteblume,"KlappentextAuf alle anderen in diesem Abteil wirke ich völlig normal; ich tue, was sie tun: zur Arbeit pendeln, Termine machen, Dinge erledigen. Wie man sich irren kann.Jeden Morgen pendelt Rachel mit dem Zug in die Stadt, und jeden Morgen hält der Zug an der gleichen Stelle auf der Strecke an. Rachel blickt in die Gärten der umliegenden Häuser, sieht ihre Bewohner. Und eines Tages beobachtet sie etwas Schockierendes …AutorPaula Hawkins wuchs in Simbabwe auf. 1989 zog sie nach London, wo sie bis heute lebt. Sie arbeitete fünfzehn Jahre lang als Journalistin, bevor sie mit dem Schreiben von Romanen begann. Ihr erster Spannungsroman Girl on the Train eroberte in England und den USA auf Anhieb die Spitze der Bestsellerlisten, und noch vor Erscheinen des Romans sicherte sich DreamWorks die Filmrechte.InhaltJeden Morgen pendelt Rachel mit dem Zug in die Stadt, und jeden Morgen hält der Zug an der gleichen Stelle auf der Strecke an. Rachel blickt in die Gärten der umliegenden Häuser, beobachtet ihre Bewohner. Oft sieht sie ein junges Paar: Jess und Jason nennt Rachel die beiden. Sie führen – wie es scheint – ein perfektes Leben. Ein Leben, wie Rachel es sich wünscht.Eines Tages sieht sie etwas Schockierendes. Kurz darauf liest sie in der Zeitung vom Verschwinden einer Frau – daneben ein Foto von >>Jess<Der erste SatzSie liegt unter einer Silberbirke bei den alten Gleisen unter einem Steinhügel.Meine MeinungAuf >>Girl on the Train<< war ich unheimlich neugierig, ich musste es unbedingt haben und gleich lesen. Unsere Sommerlichen Temperaturen passten in diesem Fall wirklich sehr gut zur Geschichte :)Mit der Protagonistin Rachel wurde ich am Anfang gar nicht warm, sie war mir unsympathisch und ihr verhalten empfand ich zu Beginn der Geschichte mehr als fraglich. Auch mit Megan wurde ich nicht sofort warm. Der Anfang von Girl on the Train zog sich sehr, es dauerte einige Seiten bis die Geschichte ihren Reiz und ihre Fahrt aufnahm, aber dann oho konnte mich die Autorin Paula Hawkins ans Buch fesseln. Mehr mag ich euch gar nicht verraten ihr müsst es lesen.FazitNicht nur für Pendler eine Leseempfehlung. Wer Drama liebt, sollte zugreifen."
1429,IncessantBookworm,"There are not enough words to describe how fast I flew through this novel to figure out what in the heck is going on. Not usually a thriller genre type of reader, I was pleasantly surprised with how quickly obsessed and immersed I became with the story. Just when I thought I had something figure out, bam, Hawkins hits me with another curve-ball.I'll be honest, at first, I was concerned that the story would be closely related to that of Gone Girl, however although there were some moments of deja vu, I believe that The Girl on the Train has its own fresh storyline and twists and turns throughout. How could it not when the plot never slows down, especially with the help of smooth transitions of perspective to perspective, each one ending on a cliffhanger. I loved how no main character remained consistent in my opinions of them as I, along with each of the three women, were trying to figure out what happened? My emotions ranged from pity to hatred and anxiety to fear over and over throughout the story. There were moments where I had no idea what to think and I wanted to throw my hands in the air and give up trying to figure it all out. Read The Girl on the Train if you like the themes of: Jealousy Relationships Obsession Alcoholism, Counseling"
1430,georgia,it is a little slow to start but rolls along less than half way stick to it as it reminds me of a hitchcock movie with twists and psychological thoughts.
1431,Whitney,Wow! Seriously gripping story. Didn't know who did it untilthe very end!
1432,Najla Putri17,Sebenarnya mau ngasih bintang 3.5. Review selengkapnya menyusul. 
1433,Lisa Shultz,Lots of suspense and mystery to carry me along as I listened to the Audible version. That was fun because I enjoyed the accents. The story was interesting and unfolded gradually through the eyes (and voices) of 3 women. A fun book to read or hear while driving or traveling. 
1434,Tara (box5angel),Mind blown. That's all I've got. Ready for the movie. 'Cause you know it's coming. 
1435,Rachel,"As far as mysteries go, this followed the usual plot scheme. You get glimpses into the victim's life. Suspects are found. Suspects are found innocent despite misgivings otherwise. The actual killer is discovered in the end, and the protagonist's life is at stake when confronting the killer in one last struggle before the book is resolved.It's a good scheme. It works for a reason.What I loved about Paula Hawkins's book is that she added to that scheme elements you don't always find in novels. The protagonist wasn't supposed to be heavily involved in the mystery. She wasn't a journalist, a detective, a family member of the victim, a witness, or even a close neighbor. She was an alcoholic, brokenhearted, commuter who saw the victim on a regular basis as she rode the train.The author also gave us a heavily flawed protagonist. Rachel lets us into her world of struggling with day-to-day life. She shows us how she's drowning in the world as it is and turns to alcohol to escape from that. The struggle and the pain make her real. The addiction makes her vulnerable. As far as realistic characters go, Paula Hawkins has created one of the best."
1436,Entre palabras,"La chica del tren es de esos libros que hay que leer sin conocer nada sobre él, así que no voy a decir mucho sobre su trama. Solo diré que, aunque al principio todo parezca súper confuso y nada parezca tener sentido, al final las historias se van acercando y todo va encajando. Y hasta aquí puedo leer. O escribir, más bien.En cuanto a mi opinión sobre el libro he de deciros que me ha gustado muchísimo. He leído muy pocos libros de este género y me ha gustado la experiencia. Cuando comencé a leerlo casi me vuelvo loca, nada tenía sentido e incluso tuve que anotar a parte quién era cada personaje para no hacerme un lío. Pero luego todo cobra sentido. El libro está escrito de forma que hace que te montes tus propias teorías, tus propias sospechas.Además, la historia no está contada por un solo personaje, sino que se nos dan varias visiones, lo que nos hace ir encajando todas las partes.Por poner una pega, he de decir que la autora complica y enreda la historia quizá demasiado para la resolución que tiene todo al final, aunque en ningún momento lo había imaginado. Pero en general, el libro merece mucho la pena, y por ello le he puesto 4 estrellas sobre 5."
1437,Jessica Medved,"I listened to this over a week and a half and I enjoyed it! This story follows three women, Rachel, Anna, and Meghan. Rachel is the drunk ex wife. Anna is the beautiful new wife. And Meghan is the beautiful dead girl. The story starts out with Rachel riding the train into and out of London everyday. Everyday she passes two houses, one with Meghan where she fantasizes about the wonderful life they have and then also Anna's (which used to be hers) where she curses her ex husband and his new wife. Then one day Meghan goes missing and Rachel gets a little too involved in the investigation. She is convinced she knows who has done it. Then she starts questioning it all starts wondering if her memory is right. If Meghan was who she thought she was. All of the sudden the truth comes to her. At first in flashes and then in a huge wave. It was a compelling listen. I grew attached to the characters and their situations. I felt for Rachel and hated Anna. It was just so well written. My biggest grip is that the switching between characters was annoying and difficult to change tracks again, especially since it switches dates all the time. It just gets very distracting. This is only the third suspense or thriller kind of read I have ever read/listened to and I think I am really getting into the genre. I enjoy trying to figure out the mystery and the twists and turns. "
1438,Lisa Goetz-Spitko,Good twist at the end. A little tedious in the middle. 
1439,Angie,"I really enjoyed this book, I got it by chance as a present as I was unsure about purchasing it my myself but I must say - I loved it.I gave it four out of five stars due to ending. Although the ending was not terrible, I wished the author explained what happened to the other characters that I lives I was reading; what happened to Anna and Evie? What happened to Scott? The book ended abruptly with all that happened in the last chapters just to have the last chapter be Rachel moving away and finally stop drinking. BUT SERIOUSLY WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OTHERS?! As Rachel stated, the houses of Scott and Anna are now empty.I pace of the book was favorable which kept me reading, there was always something happening, always something revealing into the characters lives and always a reason for me to continue reading. I haven't really read many thriller books but this one gave me a good impression of the genre. I felt Paula's writing style was simple and engaging which is what I enjoyed in the book, the sentences were not so stretched out or the chapters which meant I could comfortably reach an end of a chapter before I had to set the book down.Overall, I really did enjoy this book but the ending still bothers me, I was invested in not just Rachel's life but the others and not knowing how Anna and Evie continued after Tom's murder and Scott being cleared makes me wonder."
1440,Shannon,"Before I decided to read this book, it was everywhere. Lists of books to read now that you'd finished this book and awards it had won, etc. I checked out a few reviews of it, to see what everyone said, and though most of the reviews were positive or were only negative for what I took to be unimportant reasons (like the cussing), I was surprised to see that a lot of people claimed they had figured out the twist. I thought to myself, yeah, sure, I'm sure you all figured it out. I thought, if it really were that easy to figure out, it wouldn't be so popular. Well, it is that easy. As soon as we get introduced to everyone and learn the basics of what's going on, it's pretty obvious. I thought maybe that was a trick, make one person seem obvious from the start and then have it be someone else. Nope, no surprises there. Despite this, the book was actually still a very interesting and compelling read. Since I felt sure I must be wrong, I kept wanting to read so much to find out what had really happened. Well-written, fast paced, all those things a good thriller should have. My only other complaint is that I wish Rachel were a tiny bit more likeable, and also slightly less stupid. All that drinking struck me as idiotic, but I guess fairly in character. A good read, definitely interesting enough to warrant the acclaim, but not much of a twist, sadly."
1441,Cynthia,wow .. loved it ... expected more of a surprise at the end but overall a good read ... hard to put down at times
1442,Haylie,"When are we going to stop promoting books with female protagonists as being the ""next Gone Girl""? This was a good book! Don't get me wrong. But it ain't no Gone Girl.I’m sure this is an outstanding book to simply read, but it’s even more thrilling when you listen to the audiobook (like I did). I have wanted to read this book for AGES and it finally came through to me on the library wait-list. I was SO EXCITED. And I certainly wasn’t disappointed.Rachel was so sad. So, so sad. I felt so bad for her, but I also know that she was semi-to blame for her situation. I felt for her, wanting to be involved so desperately in a situation she wasn't really involved with at all. She wanted to be a part of something exciting and that made so much sense to me.I didn't sympathize as much with Megan until she revealed her big secret, but even then, she wasn't very likeable. I was often irritated with her intense longing for a new life because she could just go and do it.Anna made me want to hurt someone. What a bad person! I got so tired of her talking about how important being a mother is. She said at one point that she felt like she should be paid for being a mother. I don't understand that. It was very annoying. Also, didn't like how she LOVED that she was a mistress. Cheaters suck, but she was pretty terrible. I definitely caught on to the big twist before it was revealed, but I still felt like I caught on way later than everyone else who has read this. What can I say? I love being tricked and not knowing what the big surprise is until the very last second. It was a good book. Not a new ""Gone Girl"", but a good book. It would translate well into a movie. It's definitely for people who like reading from different perspectives and like reading about women with problems."
1443,Animlgrl,"A good, fast paced, easy read. I loved the idea of watching someone else's life from the train...and then finding yourself involved in something you'd imagined...that was probably the creepiest part of this book. I have read others say that it is a twisted, messed up story, and certainly the characters are not normal (or are they?)...some have compared it to Gone Girl...I have not read that yet, so cannot make the comparison. But after reading other reviews on how ""sick"" and ""twisted"" this was, meh. It wasn't that for me at all. A smidge anticlimatic, but still a fast, gripping read."
1444,Márcia,"Gostei bastante,mas a meio do livro já tinha percebido quem era o assassino."
1445,Kiffany,Amazing debut thriller! The story had me with every twist and turn right up to the end.
1446,Tanya,"This novel is told from the perspective of three different women, Rachel, Megan and Anna; and centers on the disappearance of Megan. Rachel is an unemployed, divorcee with a drinking problem that makes her prone to blackouts. Megan is a young married woman with a troubled past and a propensity to run away from things. Anna is the new wife (and former mistress) of Rachel’s ex-husband.Each woman/narrator is as unreliable as the next, but each in her own way. So, if you don’t enjoy a first-person, unreliable narrator, this book will have you crawling the walls and looking for sharp things to jab into your eyes.Personally, I love a look into an addled mind. I mean, it freaks me out and haunts me for days, much like Gillian Flynn’s novels, but I love it. I have the belief that there are people out in the world that think and act just as these characters do. They see what they want to see, believe what they want to believe, rationalize things to fit their world view and do exactly what they want to do. It’s scarier than a horror flick, being inside a mind like that and then realizing that you do some of the exact same things; and, in fact, may be doing them as you are reading about them! “Now look what you made me do.”So, despite the fact that I will be giving everyone a second look for at least another couple of weeks to assess their level of delusion, I would recommend this book. Plus, I finished it in a couple of days, so it’s a quick read, maybe one for the commute to work."
1447,shady boots,Huh. That was interesting.
1448,Danielle,3.5 star
1449,Daniel Nichols,Can confirm. Is good.
1450,Amanda Coak,"I mostly enjoyed reading this book. I did have a few moments where Rachel was KILLING me because she is so obsessive and awkward that I couldn't deal. However, I think the book is enjoyable for anyone who likes a good, suspenseful, whodunit-type read. I figured out who did it pretty early on, but I wasn't prepared for the ending (which is so much more satisfying than Gone Girl). "
1451,Meagan Houle,"People have grumbled that this is ""no 'Gone Girl'"", but I ask, why does it need to be? It has plenty of merit on its own without being compared to Flynn's work (which, by the way, most people haven't actually read--they've just seen the movie). This does have the realism and unapologetic grit of a Flynn novel, and the murder mystery element makes it all the more familiar. But in my humble opinion, Hawkins has something flynn doesn't: a way with beautiful prose. She tells the story with excellent pacing, but her descriptions of even the most mundane details--a shaft of sunlight, or a glass of wine--are exquisite. From the first page, I knew I would love this book, for the writing alone if for no other reason. Fortunately, there's more to this book than excellent prose, though. Each voice--Megan, Anna, and Rachel--is distinct and necessary. I grew to dislike all the women for their pettiness, their tendency to swallow the honeyed words of an attractive man, and their unwillingness to pick up the pieces of their lives. But I grew to love them too: Anna, for her unflinching loyalty to her family, even if it might be misplaced; Rachel, for her ultimately kind nature; and Megan, for her flawed but fragile soul. Each of the characters were relatable enough, but I felt especially bonded to Rachel, whose obsessive personality and longing for acceptance struck a chord deep within me. She reminds me of, say, myself at fifteen or so, but with the insight and scars of a grown woman. I read this book in one sitting, and I can't wait to find out what else this author has to offer. I'd recommend this book to absolutely anyone! "
1452,Dhara,"Such a great twistKeeps you on your toes the whole time. An easy read for this summer, interested to see how they interpret the movie."
1453,Tia,"I'm only a quarter way through, but The Girl On The Train by Paula Hawkins is about a girl named Rachel who takes a train everyday. When she’s on the train she looks out the window when it goes pass this house. Rachel sees this house everyday when she’s on train and watches at couple that live at the house. One day she sees something that isn't right and she tries to get involved but ends making it worse. The book is pretty slow at the beginning, but then it picks up and gets more interesting towards the middle of the book. At the beginning nothing really happens because it's mostly her on the train and day to day life. Also it doesn't really talk about the couple in the house she sees everyday on the train. What happens to the couple in the house? “There is a pile of clothing on the side of the train tracks. Light blue cloth-- a shirt,perhaps--jumbled up with something dirty. It's probably rubbish, part of a load dumped into the scrubby little wood up the bank.” "
1454,Lara Morrow,"Great book - each character is screwed up in a major way. If nothing, you will feel really great about your own life when you finish this book. It's being compared to Gone Girl, which is it nothing like. I guessed what would happen about half way in. It's not a huge twist but it's entertaining. "
1455,Christopher Hicks,"This book was completely insane!! There were so many twists and turns and the characters were all demented!! Lol, I had a hard time putting it down!! "
1456,Cathy Klein,"I found THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN to be an interesting choice. I thought the premise was different and it moved along quite easily. Poor Rachel, the girl on the train, is having a hard time coping with her everyday life. Her marriage fell apart, she began drinking and she also lost her job all within a short amount of time. She decides to kind of hide what her life has become by still taking the train into London to appear to still be going to her job. As she does, the route takes her right by her old place where her ex-husband still lives with his current wife. At the same time, she also notices another couple just a few doors away that she decides to weave a perfect story around until one day she sees the unthinkable to her. Rachel sees the girl she perceives as the ""perfect wife' having an affair with someone else. This woman shortly also disappears and is found dead. Rachel decides to put herself smack dab in the middle of the mess to try to figure out what really happened. Neither the police, nor anyone else involved sees her as a credible witness due to her drinking and lying about her life. I actually came to feel very sorry for Rachel while at the same time wanting her to just grow up. Thankfully, she does redeem herself at the end of the tale, but during the story you are almost not surprised that one thing after another does not go her way.There is enough foreshadowing about 2/3 through the book for everyone to figure out who murdered Megan (""the perfect wife""). With that being said, it is still a satisfying ending with a lot of added intrigue and details not previously revealed. All in all, a good read I think ost will really like."
1457,Esther,"ik vond dit boek echt ontzettend goed. Er zijn weinig thrillers die ik goed vind, zoals het meisje in de trein. Ik had de clue ook niet verwacht. Een geweldig boek om in je boekenkast te hebben. :)"
1458,Joana Gonçalves,Meu deus! Este livro tirou-me o fôlego!Fiquei surpreendida! Não estava mesmo nada à espera deste desfecho! Gostei imenso! 4****
1459,Mary Ellen,"This was a fast paced fun read. It is part mystery, part thriller and part psychological drama. There are three narrators and all of them are untrustworthy. The book deals with their ""issues"" and how their lives become intertwined. I recommend it."
1460,Penney,"Dark and twisty turns. A modern who- dunnit with such an easy start that the end rattles. A shout out for a female, alcoholic protagonist. It's easy to write angry, man chasing, or shallow females, but another to create depth with such flaws."
1461,Catlin Moore,"I resented the main character - Rachel - right up until the end, when the author brilliantly shifted my entire perspective on her mental health and reality. I couldn't help but get involved in the nuances of everybody's lives in the book - a masterful statement about how our collective behavior (and voyeuristic nature) has evolved in modern times. "
1462,Jessica (Jess Hearts Books),"4.5 starsPeople watching is a pastime that most people indulge in on their daily commute. When you see the same faces every day it’s easy to imagine what their lives might be like.Rachel’s train stops outside the same row of houses every day and so a couple who live at one of the houses who Rachel has named “Jason and Jess” have come to feel familiar to her as she watches them live their lives for a couple of minutes each day.Then one day Rachel witnesses Jess kissing somebody who isn’t Jason and when she sees Jess – whose real name is Megan- is missing in the news the life that she’s observed for so long collides with her own as she becomes obsessed with unravelling the mystery.It becomes apparent early on in the book that Rachel is an unstable character. In the last two years her marriage has broken down after her ex-husbands affair, she’s had to leave her beloved home and she’s been fired, all the while becoming more and more dependent on alcohol to get through each day. She uses the mystery surrounding Megan’s disappearance as a distraction from her own life and the lengths she’ll go to to be involved are certainly unhinged.I think that a lot of people who pick this book up will find Rachel unlikeable but I was sympathetic towards her situation and found her such a compelling character to read about. The fact that she often experiences blackouts in her memory when she’s been drinking made her a very unreliable character who kept me guessing.I have to admit that I did see where the book was going when I was about half way in but there was also a lot of new information uncovered throughout the book that made me question myself. I really struggled to put this book down because I had to know if I was right!Overall The Girl on the Train was a well written and original thriller that I think would translate beautifully to the big screen. With the age old moral of never knowing what goes on behind closed doors it also shines a chilling light on the fact that we never really know those closest to us either."
1463,Ashley Stroman,"At first. I really did not like this book. I had a hard time relating to the main character, Rachel. I honestly did not care about her at all, which is not good when she is the main character of the story. However, about a third of the way through the book, I became more interested in the story and the characters. You learn more about why Rachel is the way she is, and you start to empathize for her. You also start to see the story unwind and see how all the characters are apart of the story. I thought the writing was excellent in the book, and I also liked how the story was presented. I also liked the ending of the book. I felt that there were hints early on in the story about a certain storyline, and I was glad that it actually happened . Overall, I liked this book a lot in the end. I also liked it more than Gone Girl, which is a book that this one is heavily compared to. Great book!"
1464,Courtney Jadevaia,"If you liked Gone Girl, this is definitely a good book for you. I love psychological thrillers like this. I was constantly on my toes and did not expect the ending at all. Def a MUST READ."
1465, εrica,"Holy crap... what an amazing thriller.I feel like, as an avid reader, I can guess who the murderer is or at very least the suspect, but until the characters started to know, I was clueless. The entire book kept me interested, but the last 100 had my complete attention. 4 stars because I wish I could say that I liked ANY of the characters in the book, but I didn't... I started to like Rachel at the very end, but it wasn't enough. I think I more ""felt for her"". Definitely worth the read and I'm looking forward now, to the movie!"
1466,Cos,"Se me hizo muy pero muy atrapante, no podía soltarlo. Me leí la mitad en un vuelo de ida y la otra mitad en el de vuelta. Le pongo 4 estrellas y no 5 porque no me termina de convencer el final, si bien la autora cierra la historia me dejó con ganas de más."
1467,Mary Fisher,"Not as good as I was hoping, although I could not put it down."
1468,Jocelyn,"I love books with unreliable narrators. Not only do I have the main plot to enjoy, but I also have the puzzle of which part of the narration is true. Imagine my delight on finding a book with three narrators, all unreliable! The Girl on the Train is told by Rachel, Anna, and Megan. Rachel is the lead narrator, if you will. She takes the train into and out of London everyday. It goes by the houses of Anna and Megan slowly enough that Racel often sees Megan and her husband. She doesn't know Megan so she makes up stories about their life together. Anna is married to Tom, Rachel's ex husband, who lives in the house that Tom and Rachel lived in.As Rachel continues her narration we learn that she drinks heavily and is having some trouble coming to terms with her divorce. When she sees Megan with another man she is disappointed. The next day Megan goes missing and Rachel feels the need to tell the police and Megan's husband about seeing the strange man. Her drinking makes this problematic as the police don't believe her, and she was in the neighborhood the night of the disappearence but doesn't remember anything from that night.When Anna takes over the narration, we learn that she is feeling harrased by Rachel because Rachel calls often and intrudes on her new life with Tom and their baby. Anna, though, has her own agenda. She had an affair withTom while he was still married to Rachel. Megan's narration starts about a year earlier than the rest of the book and describes the problems she is having with her life and marriage...not the perfect marriage that Rachel had invisioned, nor the perfect life.As the three lines of narration wend their way through the story, you realize that not everything is at it seems. As a reader, you feel sympathy for first one, then the other. They are all deeply flawed people, trying to find their ways out of situations, some of which are their own making.And then there are the men. Tom, Scott, and the therapist that first Megan, then Rachel, sees. Any of the characters could have caused Megan's disappearance. Everyone has skeletons in their respective closets, which make the book very interesting. It has been compared to Gone Girl quite a bit, partly because of the husband/wife dynamics and partly because of the twist at the end; but the twist wasn't as unexpected as in Gone Girl, and in the end, it wasn't as dark. This is not a book with a hero in it, and at one point I didn't like any of the characters, but there is character growth. Definitely a good mystery."

The holes in your life are permanent. You have to grow around them, like tree roots around concrete; you mould yourself through the gaps.
What was it that people used to say... Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned? I love it when girls roll up their sleeves and go on a rampage, killing everyone in their way, stilettos digging through the necks of their lying and cheating boyfriends or husbands. If some girl were to ask me what to do if she finds out that her boyfriend or husband is cheating on her, I would say, without batting an eyelid, ""
Go Amy Dunne on him
.""But you know, we rarely read about characters like that. It's often girl versus girl with the boy watching from a distance, clearly amused by the ongoing catfight. Whenever I read novels about women, the unconventional types, those that are flawed or broken in some way, I would always feel bad if I see some form of jealousy among them - between mother and child, for instance, or between sisters, and more often, between wives and mistresses. I feel bad because women are often represented in a bad light, like they're always out to scratch each other's faces or drag each other down ... where's the girl power ladies? And to think some of those reasons are always petty, ridiculous even. This reminds me of that classic story about the Trojan war which started with oafish Paris using the muscle between his legs to decide which goddess - Hera, Athena, or Aphrodite, deserved the title ""fairest"". And the rest, as they say, is history. The rest meaning that bloody war to get Helen back to Greece. Thinking about it now, I can't help but roll my eyes about the whole shallowness of it - these women - goddesses!! fighting over that silly title, and Aphrodite getting Paris and -married!!- Helen together, not realizing the disastrous outcome of her actions. I mean, it's the old times for God's sakes, everybody's so hotheaded it's either a spear down your throat or up your ass. So you see, as a woman, I don't like reading about pettiness and women fighting over things. Therefore, this novel felt a bit slippery for me, like my other hand's on the cover of my e-reader ready to slap the cover down should I decide I've had enough of this silliness. The thing is though, I stayed until the end. 
It was that good
.There are three unreliable narrators of the story - Rachel, Megan, and Anna. They are, by all means, unlikeable characters: Rachel is a needy, clingy, alcoholic who can't and doesn't want to move on from her divorce; Megan a lying and hysterical cheat, and Anna, a delusional and judgemental paranoid. Go on, take your pick. I won't deny that it was also a hard read, many times I'd find myself grunting in annoyance or exasperation, especially when I read Rachel's parts which dominated about 60% of the narrative. However, no matter how fucked up they all are, these are realistic portrayals. I can think of one or two real people who are their own Rachels, Megans, and Annas. Their stories will converge at some point - it was an evenly paced, if somewhat too fast, mystery-thriller, and it's a guaranteed guessing game till the end. As I've said, the characters are unreliable narrators, and there's this deceptive way of concealing significant events on Rachel's end because she has this habit of ""blacking out"" whenever she's in alcoholic stupor. Trust me, she'll be as frustrated as you are attempting to piece the events together. Personally, I liked the holding back, it gives more room for speculation like any typical mystery-thriller novel should do, except Hawkins also succeeded in keeping her characters well rounded (even the men who are equally fucked up!), the scenarios in my head were just endless. Definitely an engaging ride from start to end, I loved every bit of it, and loved-hated all the three women.Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned?Boys, you have no idea. "
1471,czai (the Blacksheep Project),"I picked this book up just because it's a suspenseful mystery... well at least that's what we people say. I see it on goodreads a lot. A LOT.Rachel takes the train every morning. She sees this perfectly married couple, Jess and Jason. But then one day, she doesn't. She sees the news and find that the wife, Jess, is missing. The night Jess went missing is the same night she seem to forget everything that happened then. She feels that she saw something important that night but then she's not sure.When other readers said this is suspenseful, I see now what they mean. It's got a really thrilling pace which changes from one point of view to another. Furthermore, the time between point of views are different. Two point of views, Rachel's and Anna's, are set in present, while Megan's is set from the past. The difference of the POVs and their time frame really adds up to the intriguing side of the story. As I read through, I always check out the dates, especially Megan's, and try to see how things will connect.Rachel is such an unreliable heroine. She mainly tells the story. She's a drunkard and would occasionally pass out and forget what happens. She fails to remember events and sometimes mixed them all together. Her narration is both thrilling and made me think twice about the culprit. In fact, I never really guessed who the culprit is (but I'm thinking people who've read Gone Girl would have guessed it since it's the book which this is compared to).The ending was totally heart stopping. I had to read it in one go. I can't put it down not because I still have no idea who the culprit is but once everything started making sense, everything just started going faster than usual and it was crazy. I like how exciting the climax is and how everything was perfectly put together.OVERALL, The Girl on the Train is a fast-paced thriller. I was immediately absorbed into its intriguing mystery with a climax that's really difficult to put down. It's got an unreliable heroine who decided to put herself in the middle of things. It's a recommended read for people who enjoys thriller-mysteries."
1472,Nati Beroiz,"Es verdad que la historia te atrapa y no te suelta en un segundo. Leí el libro en un día, por más que no sea algo totalmente nuevo, confieso que no podía parar de leerlo."
1473,Kaity,"Great story. The character development and twists had me hooked so quickly that I couldn't put it down, even if all of them were completely rotten people. One of the best for me so far this year. 4 "
1474,Katie Doughty,"Loved reading this book.... first one in a while that I truly did not want to put down. I love the way it is written with multiple narrators and jumping back and forth from morning to evening. I figured the whole book out on page 230! I had been cooking a different theory from pretty early on, but once I had that moment of clarity, I could see exactly where it was going and even what clues I missed. Definitely happy with this book club choice."
1475,Nancy,"I had to really feel sorry for Rachel, alcoholic, jobless, divorced living in a room of a ""friend"" who feels sorry for her. She is so alone. Her husband Tom dumped her for Anna and they had a baby. Anna and Tom are living in Rachel and Tom's old home. Rachel pretends to go to work each day and the train goes by her old home. She also checks out a home a few doors down and sees a couple that she invents a story around. She sees the woman (Megan) with another man and she is determined to tell the husband. But she is so drunk by the time she gets to the station and has a black out. The woman is reported missing and Rachel gets involved with the woman's husband (Scott) and the woman's therapist thinking she is helping out and trying to figure out what happened to Megan. Megan is found dead. The story is told in the voices of the women, Megan, Anna, and Megan. Hawkins makes the references to the men in Megan's story a little ambiguous so that you really don't know who her lover is, but I figured it out about 1/3 of the way through. Good story, quick read."
1476,Barbara The MarSienne,"Un très bon polar, original avec l'histoire du train et qui arrive à nous plonger dans une ambiance angoissante et dépressive. Le personnage de Rachel est tellement névrosée et obsessionnelle qu'on a tantôt envie de la détester que de l'aimer car elle en rajoute toujours une couche alors on a envie de lui dire ""Stop!"" mais elle a quand même un bon fond.Sinon avec ce livre on se rend bien compte que les apparences sont trompeuses et qu'on ne sait jamais comment ça se passe au sein d'un couple."
1477,Alycia,"LOVED this book. The only problem was the drinking problem in the book, I wanted Rach to be well & what the hell the end??? I didn't expect this I know I know"

"" I am no longer just the girl in the train, going back and forth without point or purpose. ""
If you are going to read this book, be prepared! This book is not the book where you'll find the characters were safe at their homes and will find their happily ever after. So, I suggest you to read this in the sunlight, if possible with lots of people swarming around you.The most interesting thing about this book is that: you cannot trust anyone in this book. Each character in this book was a wreck. After all, as quoted from Emily's review ""...between an alcoholic, a liar, and a cheat, who could you trust?""I think Paula Hawkins did a really great job about the characterization too, because as wrecked as they are, I still felt a thousand of emotions from pity, sympathy, disgust, tolerance, and so much more in each character and that's just a whole new experience for me."
1479,Wal.li,"Train spottingVor einigen Jahren wurde die etwas über 30jährige Rachel geschieden. Weil sie während der Arbeitszeit getrunken hat und ausfällig geworden ist, hat sie ihren Job verloren. Eine eigene Wohnung kann sie sich nicht leisten, doch ihrer Vermieterin und Freundin hat sie nicht einmal erzählt, dass sie arbeitslos ist. Jeden Morgen besteigt sie den Zug nach London, den der mitten auf der Strecke hält, in der Nähe ihres alten Hauses. Doch nicht nur dieses beobachtet Rachel. Ein paar Häuser weiter lebt ein junges Paar, das ihre Phantasie anregt. Sie malt sich aus, welch ein glückliches Leben die beiden führen, gibt ihnen Namen, wünscht sich, sie würde selbst ein glückliches Leben führen und nicht von einem Alkoholrausch zum Nächsten stolpern. Doch dann verschwindet die junge Frau.Nicht gerade sehr sympathisch wirkt die Alkoholikerin Rachel, die ihre Tage mit dem Gedanken an das, was verloren ist vertut, anstatt sich etwas Neuem zuzuwenden. Mit einigem Widerwillen liest man die Zeilen über ihr Gejammer, ihre Vergangenheitsbezogenheit, ihre alkoholgeschwängerten Ergüsse. Warum schließt sie nicht mit der Vergangenheit ab, mit ihrem Ex-Mann Tom, der doch offensichtlich nichts mehr mit ihr zu tun haben will. Er hat schließlich eine neue Frau und ein Kind. Nur nach und nach gehen einem einige der Hintergründe auf, die mit dazu beigetragen haben, dass aus Rachel die wurde, die ohne Ziel und Zweck mit dem Zug fährt. Erinnerungslücken, schlechte Träume und doch das Gefühl, etwas beitragen zu müssen, führen Rachel zur Polizei, wo jedoch schnell erkannt wird, wie wenig glaubhaft sie als Zeugin ist.So wie die Handlung nur langsam voranschreitet, so langsam geht einem als Leser auf, was mit Rachel geschehen ist. Und so wie Rachel nicht nur die Person ist, die sie am Anfang zu sein scheint, treiben auch die meisten anderen handelnden Personen ihre verborgenen Spiele. Mit jedem Wechsel der Perspektive erfährt der Leser eine neue Facette dieser sich langsam zum Thriller entwickelnden Geschichte. Mit fast unheimlicher Anspannung verfolgt man den Gang der Ereignisse, spürt die unbekannte Gefahr hinter jeden Ecke lauern. Ein psychologischer Spannungsroman, der einen nach und nach packt und schließlich nicht mehr loslässt. "
1480,Lisa Stosch,I am one of the few people I know who enjoyed this book. I thought it was creepy and I always love a mystery in the summer when I'm ready to read some lighter books. I thought the protagonist's struggle with alcoholism was disturbing but made the book intriguing. I would not hold high expectations or this book or attempt to analyze it too much or you may be disappointed. 
1481,A J,A gripping read - couldn't put this down!
1482,Janet Pittman,"I couldn't put this book down.... a great read during ""Dive Week"" on Cayman Brac! I kept trying to figure out the ""who dunnit"" while wondering which one of the main male and female characters was more psycho than the others. It was so interesting to see how their lives intertwined in this suspenseful story."
1483,Joodith,"Rachel is the Girl on the Train; during her daily commute in and out of London she observes the scenery out of the window; she knows it inside out – the discarded rubbish at the side of the tracks, the back gardens of the houses along the way – she misses nothing. She has even invented an idyllic life for a couple she sees regularly. One day she notices something which upsets her and sets in motion a train of events which will turn her life upside down.Rachel's life is a mess: a divorcee who has great difficulty accepting her ex-husband's new life; an alcoholic, often in a state of inebriation or lusting after her next drink. Having lost her job she continues her daily commute, not admitting to her friend (also her landlady) that she has no job. She is lonely and bitter and thoroughly unlikeable, and yet - and yet- this did not prevent me from reading this and marvelling at just how stupid she could be. She just cannot leave things alone and has a desperate need to be involved in the drama that unfolds, regardless of the consequences. Unlikeable or unsympathetic characters are usually a turn off, but in this instance the very fact that Rachel is so flawed works really well.The story is told in present tense mainly from Rachel's viewpoint, but with input from the other two main characters – Megan and Anna. Although well written and pacey, I found the actual structure – the different time lines, which actually span only just over a year or so – extremely confusing and had to keep flipping back to find out where I was. Although I had sussed this out well before the end (but then I do read a lot of this genre), it is clever, tense, with occasional touches of black humour and a good balance of character and plot. Paula Hawkins is definitely an author to watch. My thanks to Amazon Vine for a free copy to review."
1484,Kara,"Following the trend of books with unlikable and/or unreliable narrators, GIRL ON A TRAIN introduces us to three women whose lives are entangled in a web of lies and deceit involving each other. While all of the characters in this book behave despicably, I couldn't help but keep reading to see what happens to them. The plot started slow, but soon kicked into high speed, much like the train Rachel rides every day. It was fascinating to watch the web of lies untangle and learn the truth of what happened. I didn't care for any of the characters any better by the end, but was satisfied with how everything was tied up."
1485,Joana ,"I enjoyed this read, it was very interesting and intense but I feel like the main reason I didn't LOVED the book was because of my expectations being way too high. Anyway... This book made me think a lot and it changed my perspective in a lot of things (which I appreciate). "
1486,Anne Birdsong,"I did not read this book because of all the comparisons to Gone Girl, a book I thoroughly enjoyed. I did not want to read a half-ass attempt at a Gone Girl redux, and with ""girl"" in the title, I decided not to read it. Then, I was at my local bookstore, and one of the owners confessed he had given the book a try and really enjoyed it. I could find nothing else on the shelves that interested me, and my friend, Michelle, was reading the book as well, so I bought it. It's a good page-turner, with some very accurate depictions of an emotional abuse victim, how she is viewed by others (weak, possibly deranged), and how the abuser is viewed (charming, credible). It's a fast read, and a lot of the plot points are predictable, but still a good book."
1487,Aleksandra,"Obzirom na više loših od dobrih ocjena ove knjige koje sam čula, bila sam spremna na najgore! Pokazalo se ipak da meni ovo nije ni tako loša knjiga, zaplet je odličan, a roman se čita brzo očekujući rasplet, zapravo mogu reći da je ovo izvrstan predložak za film! Glavna junakinja, djevojka iz voza, Rejčel i pored svojih slobosti me nije nervirala, čak mi je bila simpatična i navijala sam za nju :) Knjiga ima tačno onoliko stranica koliko ovakva tema i zaslužuje, sve više od ovoga bi postalo zamorno jer u ovom žanru kraj je ono što se zapravo nestrpljivo očekuje. Podsjetila me na Plažu ružinih latica D. Koomson koja ima nešto bolje razrađenu priču, ali za tu temu previše stranica pa onda i postane zamorna... Marketing oko ove knjige je odrađen savršeno, postala je fenomen što mislim da ipak baš i ne zaslužuje, ali radi se o solidnoj triler-drami kojoj dajem 4."

Rachel it's a character you feel sorry for or you just hate her. I'm not gonna say the ending was a surprise, at the middle of the book I kind of knew, but I liked it anyway. I couldn't stop reading. I'm so sorry for people who didn't get the book at all. Maybe they were expecting a full thriller and I think The Girl On The Train is more about human emotions.

1489,Amyzula,Kept me turning the pages! I liked how the narrative switched from the different character's point of view and also enjoyed the British phrasing. Well written and a good however not surprising ending. A good read that holds your attention for sure!
1490,Ryan Dejonghe,"This book should aptly be called, Drunk Girl on Train: Crime Solver Edition. I’ve never seen the mechanism of drunkenness used for the slow reveal of ‘who dunnit?’. It’s brilliant, in a way. Without giving too much away: one girl is a messed-up drunk; another girl is a messed-up housewife; another girl..well..we don’t know too much of her present, just some messed-up, dark issues of her past. The book starts with a mysterious burial of a body and then later reveals a person gone missing. The comparisons to GONE GIRL are not without merit.I’m going to judge this book on “are we there yet?” moments versus “Holy Crap!!” moments. That’s what we expect from a GONE GIRL-like book, right? That made-into-a-movie book had back-and-forth narratives that twisted us around, shocked us, and left us begging to know what was going to happen. Until the crappy ending (please don’t disappoint us again, Gillian Flynn). Yes, I’ll judge this hopetfully-future-movie book on the ending, too. Just hang on.The first few chapters have that “Holy Crap!!” build-up. First the dedication to the buried body, then the crazy girl-with-issues on the train, ripping Band-Aids off her skin, digging nails into her wounds. Initial impression: this book is going to be CRAY-zy! Not quite. At least not from cover-to-cover.As the narratives flip back and forth and the fog of blacked-out drunkness begin to lift around 200 pages into it, you begin to wonder, “are we there yet?” Characters are developed in a solid manner, but you wonder if they are withholding information. That’s irksome. If a book doesn’t have a lot of action or twists, then tell us what’s happening! Such a tease.But I have to say, almost all is forgiven in the last several chapters of the book. Things get intense! Again, no spoilers here. Maybe those apparent lulls were a sign of skillful writing: it was all anticipation and build-up. And unlike GONE GIRL, I was actually satisfied with the ending. Kickass girls FTW!! (For the win.)This book is a page-turner that is great for the summer beaches. It has more “Holy Crap!!” than “are we there yet?” moments; in my opinion, that equals a net gain!"
1491,Emily Agnello,"What a remarkable book this was. There was so much thrill and action at the end. So many plot twists and affairs.This book only got four stars because 1. I do not like Tom and what he orginally did to Rachel, 2. I did not like Anna up until the very end because of the thrill she had while Tom was still with Rachel. But that's how life is. We get ourselves entangled with those whom we think we know but in return are a completely different person. I recomend this book to anyone whom enjoys thrillersand the novel Gone Girl. (Even though I still haven't read it oops)(It was one of the reviews on the dust jacket lol.)"
1492,Jorge Castanos,"Escribo este ""review"" casi exactamente una semana después que acabé el libro, a veces la vida misma se interpone en las cosas que uno suele hacer de inmediato, pero bueno.Disfruté de un 40% del libro el formato de audio (audible) y leí el otro 60%The Girl on the Train cuenta la historia de un grupo de personas, narrada desde el punto de vista de tres mujeres: Rachel, Megan y Anna. Diversas circunstancias logran que las vidas de estas mujeres se entrelacen.Difícil tejer una sinopsis sin soltar muchos detalles...Empieza un poco lento, pero no aburre. Abre con monólogos de dos de los personajes más importantes. Historias de fondo, pensamientos y demás. Rachel es alcohólica y tiende a ocultar muchas cosas, Megan tiene sus propios problemas; es inestable y no se considera feliz. Anna aparenta ser una mujer perfecta con una vida perfecta: el esposo perfecto y la pequeña hija perfecta.Es un libro sumamente fácil de leer, con una escritura simple pero exquisita a la vez, muy madura y con una premisa atractiva. Definitivamente no parece el primer intento de una autora.Comparan la novela con ""Gone Girl"" de Gillian Flynn y sobre eso puedo decir que, al igual que Flynn, Hawkins traza a personajes femeninos complejos, multidimensionales y ricos en detalles pero, a diferencia de Flynn que también crea personajes masculinos con igual complejidad, Hawkins peca de presentarnos a sus personajes masculinos como muchas autoras inexpertas; en imagen: perfectos, en expresión: teatrales, en fondo: vacíos.Otro defecto que tiene el libro es que resulta bastante predecible; aún así, la escritura, la perspectiva de los personajes y el desarrollo mismo del libro te hacen apretar el pedal aún creas conocer lo que va pasando.Con apenas 336 páginas de extensión y con largas tandas de lectura garantizadas, The Girl on the Train se lee bastante rápido y se disfruta plenamente a pesar de sus aisladas deficiencias.La autora cita a Agatha Christie, Donna Tartt, Kate Atkinson, Tana French y, por supuesto, a Gillian Flynn como sus autoras favoritas e inspiraciones para su escritura en el género de thriller y suspenso. Un listado que se debe de tener presente a la hora de comparar y recomendar la novela de Paula Hawkins.Definitivamente leería un próximo libro de ella."
1493,Pamela,"When I commuted in Paris, I took the Métro. The majority of the lines run underground, but a few of them have sections that burst out into sunlight. I didn't have a set schedule of lines to take; a few different routes would get me to the same place. If I wanted, I could walk to the 11 and ride it all the way down the hill from which Belleville and Ménilmontant gaze upon the heart of Paris. The cars on the 11 (the brown line, a rather fecal brown, alas) were a bit rattletrap, and so when gravity shot the train down the hill, everything jumbled around and it was mildly exhilarating, as much as a commute/headlong rush down an underground can be exhilarating. Sometimes I worried the brakes would fail. Then I practiced my Gallic shrug and got on with life.Line 5, on which my stop was situated, crosses the Seine, and for a moment, I would see the city: Nôtre Dame and Île de la Cité, the Tour Eiffel, the Tour Montparnasse. Then back into darkness again. My commute was ever changing: it was an organic thing. I never saw the same people on my trains (or if I did, I was far too busy adopting a posture of Gallic indifference to notice). Part of that experience is why The Girl on the Train's narrative grabbed me: Rachel (the titular girl) passes the same house every day on her commute into London on the (also titular) train. She often sees the inhabitants outside, and she's invented names and a whole life for them. In her mind, Jess and Jason (not their real names--these are the names Rachel's given them) are the perfect couple, and Rachel finds solace in the normalcy of their lives. Seeing her fantasy couple day after day when the train makes a stop at a light keeps Rachel grounded. It's a tenuous link to reality, as Rachel's life is, not to put too fine a point on it, a complete mess.A few years ago, Rachel's husband, Tom, had an affair. He left her and had a baby with his new wife, Anna. Rachel and Tom had been trying to have a baby, but with no success. Discouraged, Rachel turned to drinking. Now, she's single, living with an acquaintance from university, fired from her job for drunkenness, and slurping canned gin and tonics at every opportunity.Let me take a moment to say that I had no idea one could purchase a can of G&T in Great Britain. This sounds simultaneously gross and intriguing.Anyway. Rachel drinks so much that she experiences total blackouts, and often gets off the train to go to her old house. Incidentally, it's in the same neighborhood as Jess' house--the one she watches every day from the train. One night, she catches the eye of a red haired chap on the train, and she's pretty sure she gets off at that stop with: the stop where her old house is. The next morning, she wakes up in bed covered in blood and in her skivvies. She has no memory of the night before, only that she walked through the underpass and... nothing. Later that day, a woman is reported missing: it's Jess, only her real name is Megan, and her husband's real name is Scott. And nothing is what Rachel thought it was.Hawkins has slowly been alternating narrative point of view between Rachel and Megan (pre-disappearance), and when she tosses Anna (the new wife) into the mix, it gets even cattier. Not that I think women should be catty--au contraire! Anna's supremely self-centered way of thinking reminded me a bit of Amy in Gone Girl (a book to which The Girl on the Train has been compared, and rightly so, for the tautness of the writing and the unflinching look into the ugly side of human nature--which is most of it, but that's neither here nor there). Rachel does everything she can to make the reader dislike her, and yet, I found myself rooting for her. Every time she made a dumb mistake or had yet another drink, I still cared about her. And as in my review of Gone Girl, I can't divulge too much of the plot without ruining the whole thing. Hawkins creates strong characters, thick tension, and a solid setting. I did guess part of the Big Reveal about halfway through the book, but rather than being disappointed by this, I felt validated that I had picked up on the cues Hawkins gave in the narration. My only quibble would be the ending. Again, to return to Gone Girl, a lot of people I know didn't like the ending. I loved it. I thought it was perfect for the book and for the characters. In The Girl on the Train, the ending fit, but it happened too fast. I felt like I slammed into a brick wall and slowly slid down like a cartoon character. That's it? It's not an ambiguous ending; it's a short ending, and it doesn't address the issue brought up by the actions of one of the main characters slightly earlier in the book (well, that was ambiguous). If you must, click for the spoiler:(view spoiler)[Okay, so what's up with Scott, Megan's husband? Obviously, he is emotionally and physically abusive, but why don't we hear anything else about him after he attacks Rachel and locks her in the closet? Are we, the readers, to assume that everything will come out once Rachel is validated as a witness? And another thing: I seriously thought Tom was slipping Rachel GSB when she was having her blackouts. Somehow, that makes more sense to me than him just waiting for her to have an alcohol blackout. (hide spoiler)] On the whole, however, The Girl on the Train was a fantastic read and something I'd recommend to pretty much anyone. I'll never think about commuting the same way."
1494,Madri,"The Girl on the Train is deel van die nuwe genre, “chick noir”, wat ŉ tipe korrektief op chick lit is. Chick noir beskryf die donker kant of aftakeling van die huwelik, daar is geen happily-ever-after eindes of mooi pienk omslae nie. Dit speel met die idee dat jy nooit werklik iemand ken nie - ook nie die persoon wat langs jou slaap nie. Paula Hawkins het hierdie tendens goed raakgesien en verstaan. En ŉ stappie verder gegaan: sy ontgin meer as net die huwelik. Sy wys die donker wêreld van drankmisbruik, lewer kommentaar op die voyeuristiese samelewing waarin ons leef en die grense tussen realiteit en ŉ “werklikheid” wat ons self skep. Sy speel met herinnering en hoe beïnvloedbaar ons is - nie net in die verhaal nie, maar ook deur die leser se idee van gebeure en houding teenoor die karakters kort-kort op sy kop te draai. Ek het tot reg aan die einde getwyfel aan my oordele en vermoedens. Dis wat 'n mens soek by 'n sielkundige riller!"
1495,Brandi,"A mystery that will have you guessing to the very end. Told from the views of Rachel, Anna, and Megan, we get to see how different parts of the story weave together. Each person sees the situations in a different light and it makes you realize that you may not truly know someone else. "
1496,comablack,"Come sempre quando finisco un libro, la cosa principale che tengo in considerazione per valutare quanto mi sia piaciuto è quanto mi abbia coinvolta.Esistono libri favolosi coi quali però si fa fatica ad andare avanti, e ci sono libri dalla trama mediocre, poco articolata, dai quali però è difficile staccarsi. ""La ragazza del treno"" appartiene perlopiù alla seconda categoria.La storia che fa da sfondo al romanzo si può riassumere in poche parole: Rachel, disoccupata e alcolizzata, ogni giorno passa in treno davanti alla via dove prima abitava. La sua vecchia casa, la sua vecchia vita... e due nuovi vicini. Rachel li vede nel loro giardino, sembrano una coppia così perfetta e invidiabile. Ma un giorno vede qualcosa che non quadra, che la turba. Da qui si snoda tutto il romanzo.Uno stile semplice ma una storia che cattura. A tratti mi ha ricordato l'atmosfera tesa di ""L'amore bugiardo"" ma mi ha fatto pensare anche a ""Una donna di troppo"". Cinematograficamente parlando fa venire in mente il bellissimo ""Match point"" di Woody Allen.4.5 stelle, perchè quelli da 5 mi hanno dato qualcosina in più."
1497,Samantha,"This hooked me from the very beginning, which is something Gone Girl didn't do (I keep seeing those two compared everywhere so I thought this was worth mentioning). It was stressful the majority of the time (so stressful that one character in particular had me ripping my hair out by the end) but ultimately satisfying.I was immediately enthralled with the narrators. Their unreliability didn't frustrate me, but made me more interested in figuring out what was going on. I was especially invested in Rachel's character. She's a (**potential spoiler**: alcoholic) and because of this some of her actions left me embarrassed for or frustrated with her, but she was still very sympathetic to me. Megan seemed to be the most complex, although that's not to say the other characters weren't. Anna seemed very one dimensional, but she surprised me by the end. The male characters were less developed than the female ones, but that's to be expected since we don't get any insight into their minds aside from what the female characters tell us about them. There were a couple times when I was brought out of the story because what a character did/thought seemed completely irrational to me... A lot of the shock value of the novel lied in the decisions the characters made, when they did things that I could never imagine doing in a million years. But their actions ultimately made sense considering their situations. These are very broken/sick/disturbed people who act in broken/sick/disturbing ways.Now that I've finished, I want to go back and look for all of the clues I didn't see right away. There's little filler here. You could 'solve the mystery' if you pay close enough attention... Which is why I cried ""Why didn't you see?! Why didn't you notice that?!"" to myself once things started wrapping up. If you like to solve mysteries before the characters do, this book would be for you. I should mention that I listened to the audiobook version of this. Listening to a book instead of reading it makes it a lot easier to get distracted and lose what's happening. It took me a few chapters to figure out that the narrators were speaking in different times-- this wouldn't have happened if I'd been reading it. This author tended to use the last sentence of chapters to add in something suspicious, telling, something to keep the reader on her toes. But I didn't have time to linger over the end of chapters like I might with a physical book. The characters voices coloured my impressions of them. I disliked Anna's voice, which immediately coloured my interpretation of her and made me dislike her more than I might have otherwise. Rachel's voice reminded me of Kate Winslet's, which might've made me like her more. Megan's voice sounded exactly like Lady Edith Crawley from Downton Abbey (Laura Carmichael) which I loved. It gave her a slight air of snobbery which fit the character well. I know a lot of people look down on audiobooks, but I'd recommend this one. It can completely change the experience you have. I went into this with little expectations and came out completely satisfied. For someone who casually reads thrillers, I thought this was really good and worth the read (/listen). "
1498,Anna Helm,Suspenseful and engaging. Wanted to strangle most everyone. 
1499,Tracy Fleming-Swehla,"I could not put this down. Delicious! Loved the twists & tuns. I don't want to say anything else, but I thought it was a great read."
1500,Shannon Kennedy newby,Nicely fast paced and engaging. Interesting twists and plays out satisfyingly. 
1501,"Debbie ""DJ"" Wilson","Looking for a great thriller? Look no further, the train has arrived. Paula Hawkins has written a tightly woven mystery with painful secrets and startling truths reveled along the way.The main character Rachael, is a heavy drinker, whose life is teetering on the edge. She has lost her husband, and her job. Yet, she continues to ride the train into the city every day, pretending to go to work. Along the way, Rachael creates a story about a perfect couple who's home backs the tracks, a home just a few houses down from where she lived with her husband.Enter Megan, who's story begins one year before Rachael's. I must confess, I got a little confused with the dates interspersed throughout the story, but realized the author was using them cleverly. Meagan's story seems to move quickly forward, while Rachael's, very slowly. I thought they were a perfect analogy for two trains on different tracks, bound to converge at some point along the way. And converge they do. Megan goes missing on a day Rachael has drank herself into a black out. What has happened to Megan and what does her story have to do with not only Rachael herself, but also her fantasy story of the perfect couple? This is definitely a thriller that keep me moving quickly through the pages. I wasn't completely satisfied with the ending, but also, loved the authors ability to keep the story bound to a short list of characters. I have no doubt this will be a big hit for thriller fans."
1502,Christopher,"Two thirds of this book were fantastic: compelling, original, and despite my dislike of thrillers, I was intrigued. And then the last hundred pages or so went in a direction I neither expected, nor particularly cared for. Instead of taking advantage of a multitude of opportunities for originality and cleverness, Hawkins instead veers off into Clichéland, taking with her what had made the book so gripping - its unexpectedness. Also I felt that Rachel's character, whilst a captivating unreliable narrator and interesting protagonist, was sometimes too heavily based upon her alcoholism, as a substitute for actual development. Despite all this, I did enjoy this book, and it's not anything short of very good - it merely caves under the strain of perhaps being pre-emptively labelled and marketed as a 'thriller', and is thus unable to really come into its own without feeling like it is appeasing the expectations of an audience anticipating thrills, rather than a well-written, consistently original novel. "
1503,Krys,"
Something happened, something bad.
I'll give this story a solid 4 stars.Can I start off by saying I haven't read Gone Girl yet? Because I haven't, I have a vague idea of the plot and story but I haven't read it so I can't compare it to that. Which is fine by me. Who wants to have their book compared to someone else's, it should be judged on its own merit. Who is to say she hadn't been working on this book between jobs long before Gone Girl had already been published? I don't know either way, but I'm just saying... So that's me with my disclaimer, can't compare it to Gone Girl, sorry, not sorry.Wow, what a creepy read. This story is told from the point of view of 3 very unreliable women. The first and main one is Rachel, an alcoholic, and you spend your whole read wondering how much of what you're getting from her can be trusted since half the time she can't even reliably remember what she did. The other two women are Anna, the mistress who became the wife that took the alcoholics place (try saying that 3 times in a row) and Megan,the dead woman that the story evolves around (her story is injected throughout, the moments past and present, that lead up to her death).Rachel, has idealized a couple she can see from her seat on the train that passes by their house, a couple she dubs ""Jess"" and ""Jason"". She imagines their life of beautiful wedded bliss, how happy they are together, perhaps to make up for how her own life is going down the drain since her husband left her for his mistress, and she started drinking her life away. Then the unthinkable happens, one day she witnesses something that shatters her idealized story for the couple as the train passes by Jess and Jason's home. Then, a couple days later she sees ""Jess'"" face on a news story, a woman who is actually named Megan that has gone missing.Can what Rachel saw that day help the police catch the killer or is she only going to make things worse?Did I like this book? Absolutely.It is everything I love about mysteries. There is intrigue and secrets within secrets and you never really know who you should be trusting... even the end leaves you with a sense of unease about how much trust anyone in this story deserves. While the story doesn't go quite as fast as I usually prefer, it was still a great book.What surprised me about me liking this story was that I didn't even really care much for the narrators. I was probably more curious about Megan than anything but I really didn't care for Anna, her attitude in general really annoyed me. Rachel, while I felt slightly bad for her, also annoyed me because it was obviously time to move on from her husband. Despite feeling that about the narrators I still felt compelled to find out where the story was going to bring them in the end. While I had guessed pretty early on, about the ""who"" it was that did something bad, I still hadn't anticipated just how skillfully Paula Hawkins was going to weave everything together. Lovely read, I hope she writes more thrillers, she's very skilled at it and I'd love to read more from her."
1504,Marina,"Spoilers!!!!!!!!I KNEW IT!Sorry, I just needed to boast because I figured it all out quite early (well, not so early, but once the clues where all there, I did figure it out pretty quickly)What bothered me a bit is that because of the description of the book, I expected something completely different. The title itself is not misleading, but the description is! Because never ever would I have thought that the girl on the train IS the protagonist. So that was a bit irritating first and somehow it disappointed me (because like I said, I was expeting something else). Another thing that I did not like is the fact that Rachel and Megan were way too similar. Whenever I read from Anna's POV, it was crystal clear. But I could not distinguish between Rachel and Megan (if you ignore the context!), I felt like there was no real difference between them.Furthermore, I was a bit angry sometimes that many of these women were so weak and depressed, but I guess that's really common in adult books. And somehow it was understandable.What I LOVED is the mind games! The suspect is constantly changing. Whenever Rachel thinks about who the killer is, there is always a motive somewhere nearby to back her theory up. Paula Hawkin's did a great job when it comes to the core question of the book. There were some moments that I thought were going to be unnecessary, like the scene where Rachel dreamt about Scott choking Megan, and I was thinking 'why would that be important? Why does Rachel dream something like that if it turns out to be a lie?' Because if those scenes were put into the story just to irritate the reader, I would critize them, but all those dreams that Rachel had acutally made sense in the end!Rachel:I felt sorry for Rachel. At first, I was constantly thinking JUST PULL YOURSELF TOGEHTER! But, after all those secrets had come out and I realized what was done to her, I felt sorry for her because she was so convinced and believed everything Tom has told her. And what I really liked in this book is the step-by-step realization: When Rachel had the feeling that what Tom said about what she had done, embarrassing him, hitting him etc. did not feel like her at all. That she did not feel sorry for those actions because she can not really remember them. It was done so slowly and slightly, so the reader could really see this realization dawning on Rachel.Anna:The writing style used whenever Anna was thinking/acting etc. fits the character. If you for example think about that moment or actually, the moments, when Anna sees Rachel, she always says/thinks that Rachel is grinning at her and that she has this suspicious, evil smile on her face. But when the story switches to Rachel's POV, you actually see that Rachel is shocked to be caught and has no bad intention. And this proves or shows how much Anna hates Rachel and why she interprets her behaviour that way.I was very unsure of Anna. I didn't know whether I could trust her, heck I even suspected her! Especially towards the end of the book, I had some grave doubts and actually feared that the story might not end quite so well for Rachel, because I honestly thought Anna was so naive and believes Tom.Scott:I always suspected that the way Rachel sees Scott can never be accurate and that there is much more to him than one might think, though especially towards the end of the story I was convinced that he can not be the killer for these two reasons: 1. it would be too obvious, 2. he loved Megan. Because despite of him being really jealous, a controll freak and even being abusive, he could not have killed Megan.Tom:I did not like Tom from the very beginning. I just did not trust him one single bit. Turns out I was right about him. What I noticed immediately is how differently he behaved, depending on whom he was with! Whenever he was with Anna, he was talking so badly about Rachel, and in fact, he sometimes said things that were a bit too much for only wanting to calm Anna. And when he was with Rachel, HE DEFINITELY LEAD HER ON. And that made me really mad, because I realized that he is manipulative. And when it actually came out that he is so much more than that, namely a psychopath, I wasn't really surprised.The sad thing though is that people like him exist. Tom knew EXACTLY what to tell Rachel/Anna/Megan, he knew what they needed to hear and he knew how to say it so that they would believe him. And all those women did not really know who he really is, and if you are in need of a certain person and Tom turns out to be this certain person in this certain situation (or more accurately: pretends to be this person), then of course you trust him.And this is what made this story so incredibly good: you could understand every person in this book and you can't really blame any of these characters for trusting Tom or for example blame Anna for hating Rachel. All those people were played with, they ended up broken and confused, it was really difficult to get clarity into their minds which made them so fragile.And I also loved the fact that this perfect picture Rachel had of 'Jason and Jesse', this perfect couple, turned out to be so far from that and was just a big fat lie/illusion.This book made me turn pages like there is no tomorrow. And except for the misleading expectations it creates and the lacking of difference in the writing style for the different POVs, there is nothing I can criticize!"
1505,Misty Fogg,"It was billed as Gone Girl-esque and did not disappoint. I was in the mood for a psychological thriller and this fed my appetite for a thrilling read with irredeemable characters. One of the main characters in an alcoholic mess and another is a damaged girl that loves to get validation through cheating. I like reading a story through the eyes of flawed characters, even if I can't relate to them personally. It makes it fun. "
1506,Denelle,Maybe not quite worth all the hype but still a solid read. 
1507,Brandt,"There's always a risk an author takes when writing a story with an unreliable narrator, and Rachel Watson, the main of three narrators of the Girl on the Train is as unreliable as they come. She's an alcoholic and is subject to drink induced blackouts that are a major part of the plot of The Girl on the Train. Having an alcoholic unreliable narrator tell the majority of a story is a sure-fire invitation to fall into cliche and produce a stereotypical character. After all, we've seen these sorts of stories before--the film The Lost Weekend being probably the greatest of these. But in her first novel, Paula Hawkins manages to create a very flawed and human character. When Rachel Watson, the eponymous Girl on the Train sees people from the windows of the train she rides religiously every morning at 8:04 AM in an attempt to fool her flatmate into thinking she still has a job, she daydreams about those she sees on the train. She fantasizes that those she observes have perfect lives that she herself cannot obtain, so these fantasies will have to do. I felt like it was a very human thing to do--who hasn't filled in the back story for some stranger they take a fancy to out on the street? Imagining is a very human thing to do, especially when trying to avoid pain and loss.The story was very compelling. I managed to read this book in a 24 hour period, which is something I rarely do. There are flaws--I wasn't keen on the extra narrators, but they were essential to getting the whole story. Unfortunately, if Hawkins lets us know early on who narrator Megan is talking about, the tension and suspense of the novel would probably get blown. As it is, it's easy to figure out before the big reveal. But in this story the characters shine and it's a fantastic first effort."
1508,Odette Romo,Slow startSlow start but over all it was a good read. Didn't like the whiney spells but great twist in the end never thought was coming. 
1509,Dominika,"4.5 starsErőteljes hangulat rögtön az elejétől, amitől még jó sokáig nem tudok majd megszabadulni! Elmélyültem olvastam végig a történetet, bele lehet feledkezni és annyi igazság volt benne, hogy engem megvett a valóságosságával.Hiába a negatív kritika, ez a könyv semmihez sem fogható. Eleve, ha valaminek úgy indulunk neki, hogy ""ez hasonló a Holtodiglanhoz"" akkor nagyot fogunk koppanni. Nem kell semmit sem semmihez sem hasonlítani, egyszerűen felesleges.A felépítése is nagyon ígéretes volt; a lassúság ahogy elkezdődött szinte úgy tűnt, mintha emlékezett kiesésünk lenne és nagyon idegesítő lenne a tény, hogy mi is történhetett. Rachel karaktere nagyon tetszett, egyszerűen nem tudtam nem kedvelni, annyira valóságos és mai volt. Lehetett érzékelni, ahogy fejlődött mint karakter.A történet összeállt már a vége előtt számomra (view spoiler)[ azért reménykedtem benne, hogy nem happy end lesz a vége, hanem mondjuk Rachelt eltünteti Tom és végül Anna vele maradna. Sokkal irritálóbb lett volna és pont ezért tökéletesebb  (hide spoiler)], de elfogadom és így is tetszett!Engem Paula Hawkins meggyőzött, szívesen olvasok a jövőben tőle még könyvet!"
1510,Madeleine,"Mörka hemligheter och skam som river upp sår. Ytlighet och det som gömmer sig under ytan. En oerhört inträngande thriller som stegras alltmer mot slutet. Det finns mycket jag uppskattar med denna bok - bland annat de tre perspektiv en får följa, vilka nyanserar händelseförloppet på ett fint och spännande sätt."
1511,Tom Mathews,"4 1/2 out of 5. This book has been called 'Hitchcockian' and it is an apt description. I can easily see it as a Hitchcock movie. I can say this without spoiling anything. Rachel is the queen of all unreliable narrators. She's a hopeless alcoholic who has destroyed her life. Her husband has left her for another woman. She's been fired from her job. She's a hair's-breadth away from getting kicked out of her lodging. She has blackouts where she does embarrassing things (or so she's told) to the point where she starts almost every conversation with ""I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."" Believe me, she says that a lot.When she becomes involved in the investigation disappearance of woman she had seen while commuting to the job she no longer had, Rachel begins to show how obsessive a character she really is. She lies and connives her way into the investigation and into the lives of people who very well could be a murderer. How else can such a situation end but badly?For much of the book I was repelled by Rachel. Her mendacity, obsessive nature, and weakness of character got her mixed up in the case and also make it hard to feel sympathetic towards her. What is compelling, though, is the question of what happened during her blackout on the night of the disappearance. Was she involved in Megan's disappearance? Was she a witness? These are all elements a classic Hitchcockian thriller....I listened to the audio version downloaded from the library. While narrator Clare Corbett did a good job in her portrayal of Rachel, Anna and Megan, more attention could have been paid to her diction and the recording in general was muffled and indistinct."
1512,Vanessa ,"This book was so twisted...I loved it! You never knew who's perspective was real, thence the suspense. The thrill. It was surprisingly over the top, equalling one wicked train ride! I gave it 3.5 out 5 stars."
1513,Gail Coffelt,"This was an exciting story. Began a little slow but once it got going, hard to put down."
1514,Kathie,"The point of view shifted among three women. The time period kept shifting as well. I found it a little hard to follow until I glanced back to prior chapters to compare time periods. If it was the intent of the author to make the reader feel as confused as Rachel often was, she succeeded with this reader. I disliked most of the characters in the book, Rachel, Megan, Anna, Tom, Scott, and detective Riley. What a cast of messed up people. I felt like the author carefully laid out their faults which evoked some strong feelings in me. I found myself shifting from thinking how I would like to tell the different characters -- you are incredibly naïve, get a grip on reality, you deserve this, he's abusing you, stay out of it, no wonder no one believes you, etc. Even though I did not like the characters, the author deserves four stars for evoking such strong reactions. "
1515,7_Eli,"It’s a lively Saturday morning, I am downtown. I am noticing, like many others, the things going around me. The people talking, the cars moving, light fall wind against their faces. Unlike everyone else, I am doing something they aren't. Every action I see, I think about what it has taken for that to happen. A man walks out with a coffee. Maybe he just got out of poverty and is getting his life together, and this is the first coffee he could afford in a long time. Then, a car speeds down the road. Maybe that driver just lost a family member in an accident. But not long ago, I didn’t think like that. I noticed everything, but then it left me, and I never thought about it again, like most people. Surprisingly enough, it was a book that changed the way I thought.The simple act of reading  The Girl on The Train  is what did it. This book is probably one of the most influential books I have ever read. It's ability to incorporate many good parts of a writer into one work is truly amazing. The plot was thrilling and on task, the writing craft was superb, and especially what the author did with character development blew my mind. These are some of the biggest parts that really stand out in this book to me. First off, the plot in  The Girl on the Train  is unique and well written. In the exposition, it's not some massive life changing scene that sets off the rising action. Take a look at this passage, ""He's a cousin from Australia, staying for a couple weeks; he's Jason's oldest friend, best man at their wedding. Jess walks towards him, she puts her hand around her waist and kisses him, long and deep. The train moves."" You probably won't believe it, but that's the exposition. Yep, that's it. Even with that as an exposition, the book is one of the most thrilling plots I have ever read, even more so than the ones with the massive exposition. That short, but powerful and simple passage sets of a whirlwind of action and thrill that ends in an breathtaking double murder, plot-twist ending. That simple start to an amazing book.I think Paula Hawkins' greatest part of this book was the character development. It may seem cliche to most readers, but I noticed something special about it. Like any good author, she is able to let the reader really understand the character. We are able to understand Rachael very well. But, what Hawkins does after that, is quite interesting. Most good readers can predict what a character will do, once they know them, but in  The Girl on the Train,  it is really hard to predict what will happen next. I find this to be a very good trait about this book because it is unlike the others and adds a new level of suspense to it because we can never anticipate the next move of a character.Finally, the plot in this book is also amazingly unique. While having subtle plot parts, like the exposition, it also isn’t like most others books. Those books add to the plot in chunks (i.e. cliff-hanger chapter endings). But, in  The Girl on the Train,  every plot part is revealed it bits and pieces throughout. This may seem odd, but to me as a reader, it allows me to have more time to think of what will happen next. Hawkins gives enough clues to find out what will happen next, and this adds new suspense to a reader who has the skills to do that.Going back to what I started with, this book has truly changed the way I have thought about the world around me. Rachael has to do this to solve the crime (I won't say anymore than this), and in the end, she solves the crime, finds the murderer, gets a job, and solves her alcoholism. The way Hawkins is able to show how effective this is in the book and in real life is one of the many skills she has.  The Girl on The Train  has been one of the most powerful, yet simple books I have ever read. Its ability to change the way I think in  real life  really showcases its beauty. Hawkins is able to use a simple exposition to create a powerful story, while not telling us each new part of the plot. She makes her characters into complex yet understandable people. I love this book for many reasons, and would definitely read it again."
1516,Robyn,"If Maeve Binchy wrote thrillers, it might be like this one. People compare it to Gillian Flynn, but I disagree. It didn't have that same intensity but it was mysterious none the less. I like how the main character was an ugly duckling and it didn't end in a normal storybook fashion. Very Binchy-esc. The ugly duck is just that, normal with a side of crazy. Great read. "
1517,Jen Estrella,"All thrillers feel similar to me in a lot of ways. There are terrible ones, and occasionally great ones, but mostly they're all in between those two extremes. This is no exception, neither terrible or amazing, but satisfactorily entertaining. Tho I will say that I definitely preferred this one to Gone Girl; but I am one of the few who hated Gone Girl..sooo for me to say that is not exactly saying much.One thing about this book is it was slightly misleading. The back blurb led me to believe one thing, but what really happened was something entirely different, tho that's not necessarily a negative. This is yet another thriller told thru coinciding alternate viewpoints, a chapter for one person, another chapter for another person, etc etc. This particular story unfolded in a pretty clever way, the opposing view points bringing about a unique and rounded story line. None of the characters were particularly likable, and Lord knows I'm not one of those intellectuals who can usually rise above a hateful protagonist and like the book anyway (GONE GIRL! Confederacy of Dunces!) but somehow, Hawkins managed to make these characters unlikable but yet still sympathetic, which was the key thing for me. And I hate to say this because anyone who's read the book will then think I am a psycho, but I found myself totally relating to Megan's character. Like a lot. It left me pondering the possibility of Hawkins having similar issues as myself because some of those things she described would be hard to tap into had you not had personal experience with them. OR maybe Hawkins just knew a crazy bitch once ;)My final verdict was a pretty pleased one. Despite the fact that I didn't really like the ending...something about it didn't sit right with me...but I was sufficiently surprised by it so I'll excuse whatever small feeling of dissatisfaction it left me with in favor of surprises and shocks. That's what a thriller is supposed to do right?! Thrill me? I have to say...I was adequately thrilled. "
1518,Indira Pino,"Caras vemos... No creí que me gustara el suspenso sin lo retorcido, pero este libro me atrapó desde el principio... "
1519,Charlene,"The Girl on the Train is one messed up story. Every character in this book is pathetic and sad and the pacing did slow down about a third of the way through. However, I found the mystery compelling enough to keep listening. There'll be no rehash of the plot here since it has been broken down and examined by several thousand people already. I'll just say that the last third of the book was a LOT of fun to listen to and I had my earbuds glued to my ears until the grand finale. And I do think it was grand, considering. I'm surprised that I enjoyed this audio as much as I did. Usually when everyone is raving about a book, I'm the only one that hates it. I'm glad that this time, I enjoyed the book too. It feels nice to belong, once in a great while.A special thanks goes out to my friend Nev Murray who kindly gifted me this audio book. Thanks, Nev! "
1520,Lindsey Phelps,"This book was recommended as a ""read if you liked Gone Girl"" book and I agree! It was very good and very twisty. "
1521,Andi,"It's hard reading a book with unlikable characters. But that doesn't make this book any less gripping.Girl on a Train starts rather innocently, with a young woman (Rachel) who takes a train to London every day, and watches (admires) a couple in their morning routine, outside on the terrace. When she sees something out of sorts, we take notice as she does. When Rachel learns the woman (Megan) is now missing, she feels that she must step forward and share what she saw, with the hope that this will help locate Megan.We soon learn how unreliable Rachel is--she's an alcoholic with a history with both this location and its nearby occupants. She's lost her job. She's divorced because of her drinking. She takes the train every day to lend the appearance to her flatmate of going to work every day, when she's really just spending her time drinking or hanging out at the library.Narration continually flips between Rachel and two other female characters, Megan and Anna (Rachel's ex's new wife). Watch the narrator and time changes when reading this one, because the narration isn't linear between shifts. It was hard to put this book down. I was anxious to find out what really happened the night of Megan's disappearance. There are clues throughout, but the ending was still somewhat surprising to me. This was a good choice for book club!"
1522,Tellulah Darling,"I got sucked in from page one and had to keep tensely reading to solve the mystery of Rachel's blackouts and the truth of Megan. If you want thoroughly dysfunctional characters, a compelling mystery and just a great suspenseful read, I recommend this book!"
1523,Adriananas,"Most reviewers who didn't like this book hated the fucked-up characters and the depressive, sullen mood of the story. That's exactly what I liked about it. It wasn't the mystery that I enjoyed most, or the major plot reveal. I thought those were okay, yet what made TGotT compelling for me, were the painfully disturbing characters; These characters aren't just unlikable, they are majorly messed up. Rachel, the alcoholic protagonist, was unsettling to read about. I could almost taste her misery in my mouth, from the self-destructive behaviour, the irrational erratic moments, to the rare sparks of hope followed by relapse. No, I did not like the characters. Not Rachel, nor Anna, Megan or Scott. There are very few redeeming moments for all of them and I can see why so many hated this book because of it. But their unappeal was not gratuitous. In my eyes, this wasn't a novel wherein you are meant to identify with the characters, to relate. They are meant to make you sick. As a character study, this was an excellent book. "
1524,Nancy Singel,"Fun modern day mystery--loved all the red herrings throughout. The silly ending, however, had me going ""Come on now. Really?"". I'll be interested to see if a screenwriter changes the ending when the book is inevitably made into a movie."
1525,Juan Rodríguez,"Crean el hype. No es prosa de lujo, pero está inteligentemente escrita y MUY bien estructurada. No lo verás venir, ese twist.--Believe the hype. It's not high prose, but it's smartly written and VERY well structured. You won't see that twist coming."
1526,Carole,"I really enjoyed this book! I agree with the other reviewers that the characters aren't likable, but I enjoyed Rachel as an alcoholic, unreliable narrator. It made the mystery and confusion regarding the problem believable because of her black-outs. I listened to this on audio and the narrators were fantastic. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time I listened. I highly recommend this novel!"
1527,Karen Kline,"This author has an amazing-but-unbeknowst-to-me method for creating a book I couldn't put down. I found myself trying to figure out how I could get out of my personal commitments so that I could go read this darn book. I simply can't figure out why I liked this book --while reading it--so much, because in retrospect it hasn't really stayed with me. I found all of the characters quite unlikable and the voice changes from chapter to chapter were sometimes hard to get into. But, dang it, I wanted to know which despicable character had killed the other despicable one. One month after finishing this book, I cannot remember the characters' names but I do remember throughout the book thinking the names were forgettable and I was forever confusing one for the other. I wanted the drunk girl to redeem herself. I wanted the men to eventually man up. I wanted the dead girl to have had a purpose for living. I wanted the home-wrecker to be honest to herself. How did I end up caring about these characters?! Paula Hawkins got inside my head, and I may have to read this book again to unlock her mesmerizing effect! Do I recommend this book? Um, kinda...well, ask me next month..."
1528,Booksdingle,Really liked the idea and the pace of this though I did guess what/who happened before the end
1529,Frank,Very suspenseful! The comparison to Gone Girl is an insult.... This book is actually enjoyable! 
1530,Maree,"I never know if I tend to dislike books more when I listen to them on tape rather than reading them, but this book seemed kind of slow and plodding, especially at the beginning (and DH agreed). Luckily, it did pick up, and left us with a good mystery and stuff to talk about during our looong road trip. But the problem about a story where everyone has problems is that they often just aren't sympathetic to where the reader wants to root for them. I felt this way with all the main characters, really. Usually I really enjoy a realistic voice with problems, but it's hard to continue to have sympathy for alcoholics, for example. If you know that drinking is going to make you do horrible things, you'd think you wouldn't do it so often...but yeah, it's an addiction, got it."
1531,Amber O'Toole,"Gripping and an ending I didn't guess. Also, I listened on audio and I think every book should be read by British narrators. "
1532,Jennifer at BookShelfery,"
What an amazing mystery!  The Girl On the Train had me on the edge of my proverbial seat the entire time.  Jessica already reviewed this same audio, and after reading her review post-listen, I agree with basically everything she says.The story is manipulative.  It's the kind of mystery that makes your heart race as you try to discern any clues Hawkins may have left on the pages as to whodunit.  I spent the entire book desperate for some kind of idea of who the killer was.  And while I had my suspicions (that were right on the money, thankyouverymuch!), I think Hawkins did a great job at making me second-guess myself all the way to the end.All of the characters are simply awful.  Truly, there was not one character I actually liked, but I ""didn't like"" them in the best possible way.  No pun intended, but listening to how they went through their situations was like watching a train wreck happen.  You knew it was coming and you just couldn't look away.  I liked that I disliked them because it gave the story a little bit of schadenfreude for me.I'm not going to spend a lot of time renumerating on this story since Jessica already did a fantastic review of it.  But suffice to say I loved this audio.  It was the kind of gripping mystery with awesome narration that I can easily become addicted to.  I will definitely be looking for more from this author! Narrator 4-1-1 Clare Corbett, Louise Brealey, and India Fisher each narrated from a different character's point of view, and they were perfectly cast.  Their voices fit the personalities so well and I enjoyed listening to them.  I will definitely be looking for more of their performances.This book may have been provided in exchange for an honest review, and therefore will be noted on the original post. "
1533,anne,"I cannot stand Rachel omigod. I know she's going through some stuff, some serious depressing stuff even. I get that but she must at least see what her behavior have cost herself and people around her. But I like that she's not deeply rooted with vengeance towards her ex husband or the new wife. If she could just stop drinking urgh. If there's one thing I can learn from this book is how terrible drinking is. But the ending tho. I would have never suspected that Tom would do such thing. It was such a great shock because he was introduced to us as kind loving he's all that material husband kind of guy and Scott was introduced as someone possessive and abusive. And when he hurt Rachel, I really really thought it's Scott. I'm annoyed with Detective Riley though and I'm so thankful that her POV isn't in the book. Not only she's prejudice but she's also judgmental. When the author add Anna's POV, sometimes I have a hard time distinguishing between her and Rachel. Apart from what they think about and what they do, there's no difference in their tone. I've read better POVish book. I think it would be more interesting if the author include Tom's POV. It will be fair towards the story. The first 50 pages of the book is kinda a drag. I checked, the excitement starts at page 50. Uuuuu what I like and hate the most about the book is how the characters were introduced. When you first read it, it felt like you accidentally skipped the introduction but actually, the introduction details were slipped in between the rambling. "
1534,anna,"*3.75/5*I expected this book to be really well written as so many people marketed this as the next Gone Girl, but it was lacking something for me. I didn't blow me away like Gone Girl did, and when there was a major reveal, I was like 'oh alright ok' and couldn't really care. However, this was a really fun break from reading YA! "
1535,Esthy,"If you liked Gone Girl, I think you'll enjoy this. Hawkins is a better writer in my opinion. More subtle, less cartoonish. We are all rubberneckers, some reluctant and secretive, some enthusiastic. So, what better place to rubberneck than from the window of a train? This is really the jumping off place for the whole plot here. A passenger on the train is witness to a crucial piece of evidence (or what she perceives as such) in the disappearance of a young woman. Lives are enmeshed. People are and aren't quite who you thought them to be. And we are all peering out of the train intently to see if we can get a glimpse. Psychological crime novels fall somewhere in the no man land between mainstream fiction and detective genre, which is a hard game to play, but I think Hawkins did it well. Not masterfully like say Smilla's Sense of Snow, but well. Page turingingly well. The characters while mostly quite believable, are all various shades of yuck. And here is the major issue that MomToKippy brought up: How to care about (or enjoy) a book if you dislike/are revolted by all the characters? Good question. I recently had this issue on Netflix's series Bloodline. I have a different take though. Rachel, the heroin here, is a falling down drunk, a pathetic, lying manipulator (never met a drunk who isn't any of these things actually). It's a bit hard to care who prevails when the best possible character spends a lot of time doing things like lying, peeing herself, blacking out and vomiting. Anyway, and perhaps it's the relative repulsiveness of all the other significant characters, I was still rooting for her. But it's more than that. She's a real underdog and you really want her to pull through, and you want to know what happens, you really do. At least I did. Read it in 2 sittings. My library has a 25 person waitlist, and I have two friends begging for my copy. Crime fiction with a psychological angle, this is for you. It leaves Gone Girl in the dust IMO. "
1536,Kerstin,4.5/5 starsWell... That was unexpected.
1537,Moonjeweler,"There are so many books in this self publishing era I just can't finish that I give this one 4 stars for keeping my interest until the end. However, the characters are all really pathetic and unlikeable which makes it really hard to care about what happens to them. The main detective work revolves around the female protagonist being blacked out drunk all the time and not remembering what happens, which is tiring. The ultimate answer to the mystery in the book is satisfying, however it's somewhat ruined by a ridiculous twist at the very end. "
1538,Bill,"I had heard a lot of chatter surrounding this book long before I read it; anyone who saw me reading Gone Girl a while back would immediately follow up ""Well have you read The Girl on the Train?"". So when I finally got my hands on a copy, I decided to give it a shot.The biggest thing I can say about this book is that really gathered steam as it went. In the first couple of chapters, I had a little trouble getting my teeth into the story and the characters, but as time went on, it really came together in an amazing crescendo. There was suspense, there was some adventure, and a lot of the things I was at first kind of skeptical about all played vital roles in the book's conclusion. It's a fairly quick read, and it does sort of echo Gone Girl's suspense and twisting plot, so it's little surprise that the two have been talked about in the same breath so frequently. Definitely worth the read, especially since it's such a buzz book right now. "
1539,Amanda Loves books,a slow start but once I got into it I really enjoyed it
1540,David,"Um livro de cortar a respiração. Apesar de a verdadeira acção ficar circunscrita às últimas 100 páginas (nem tanto), daí ter dado 4 estrelas. Mas recebe justamente o título de livro do ano de 2015. Recomendo."
1541,The Cannibal,"♫ Ding Dong ♪ *voix suave * Les passagers à destination du polar psychologique sont priés d’embarquer.Que ceux qui veulent aller vite changent de train et montent dans un TGV. Mais ils ne verront jamais ce qu’il se passe dans les maisons qui longent la ligne de notre banlieusard.Qui n’a jamais été tenté de jeter un coup d’œil dans les maisons qui se trouvent à proximité d’une ligne de chemin de fer en passant juste à côté ? Rachel est comme vous et moi, elle a aussi ce petit travers.Si Rachel avait eu un bon bouquin comme celui qui narre son histoire, elle aurait été tellement captivée par le roman qu’elle n’aurait jamais zieuté la vie de ce couple à la vie si parfaite et ne les aurait pas baptisé Jason et Jess.Rachel… j’ai eu envie de la tuer, vous savez. De lui plonger la tête dans de l’eau glacée et de lui murmurer à l’oreille qu’il serait plus que temps de se reprendre au lieu de sombrer dans les délices des bouteilles de vin blanc (et elle a mauvais goût, du blanc, beurk !).Rachel… plus épave que la « Licorne » après avoir sombré, plus imbibée qu’une éponge, elle vivote, telle une amibe, chez sa copine, se lamentant encore et encore sur son ex qui l’a quittée pour une autre. Sa vie par en… quenouille (vous avez eu peur, je parie) et elle ne fait rien pour inverser la courbe.Rachel… qui m’a énervée à toujours geindre, à ne pas avoir de volonté, et à se plaindre encore et encore pour des choses qu’elle a faite mais dont elle ne garde aucun souvenir. Bref, un personnage que j’ai détesté de prime abord. On est d’accord que c’était de prime abord…Ici, on fait dans le roman policier psychologique, les personnages sont bien travaillés, tous bien distincts les uns des autres, avec leurs qualités, leurs défauts.Le récit est articulé autour de trois narratrices : Rachel l’éponge, Anna la voleuse du mari de Rachel et Megan « Jess », la femme qui se veut indépendante.Le changement de narrateur vous empêche aussi de flinguer Rachel parce que, plus de 300 pages avec elle en train de se lamenter et de regarder sa vie partir en lambeaux, je n’aurais pas tenu sans commettre un crime.L’avantage du récit, aussi, c’est les petits retours dans le passé, avec Megan, afin de savoir ce qu’il s’est passé avant sa disparition.Chiche en personnages mais riche dans leur profondeur, ce roman, une fois ouvert, se referme difficilement. Hormis lorsque vous arrivez à la dernière page, of course.Bien qu’on ne courre pas dans tous les sens, les aller-retour entre le passé et le présent pimentent le récit, font monter la pression (à bière) et nous font mousser.Au débouchage, le vin avait l’air banal, peu engageant… Mais une fois la première gorgée avalée, les tanins se font sentir, le goût prend toute sa saveur et le récit roule sur la langue, est long en bouche, vous monte à la tête et on a qu’une envie : se resservir !Bluffée j’ai été et bien que j’ai eu des soupçons sur le personnage qui avait tué le docteur Lenoir dans la bibliothèque avec la clé anglaise. Mais j’avoue qu’avant de pointer correctement le coupable, j’avais un peu visé à côté.Un roman plus psychologique que trépidant (c’est pas 24H chrono), plus profond que léger, et bien plus intéressant qu’il ne me laissait penser au départ. Mention spéciale à un personnage foutrement bien campé ! Machiavélique ce roman.♫ Ding Dong ♪ Veuillez attacher vos ceintures, ça pourrait secouer durant le voyage de ce train."
1542,Ashby Dodd,"The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins easily scored a spot on my top-reads list, the twists and turns were perfectly placed and the wobbly credibility of main character was written in a way that was both convincing and questionable all at the same time. Hawkins’ writing is masterful in this thrilling novel that I couldn’t put down.The story is told from multiple points of view but often from the viewpoint of Rachel, a alcoholic woman in her 30’s who can see no apparent reason to get her addiction under control. Even though she’s lost her job and has no prospects on the horizon, she travels back and forth on the same commuter trains every weekday morning and evening. When her home-bound train comes to one of its regular stops every evening, Rachel checks in on a couple she has come to call Jason and Jess. In her mind, they are the perfect couple and they resemble everything that she has lost.When something terrible happens on the street where Jason and Jess live, Rachel can’t help but insert herself into the investigation – after all, she’s a perfect day-to-day eyewitness from the train, isn’t she?Reading Paul Hawkins’ words felt like being inside Rachel’s head, unable to completely trust the memories that she knows to be true and unable to recover the memories that hold clues to what happened that night. As she struggles to get her alcoholic ways under control and put her heartbreaking past behind her, she tumbles further and further into an investigation she may have no business being a part of. With every new memory and piece of information uncovered, the reader is just as torn as Rachel is, save herself and get out or get her memories back and possibly help save a new friend.I highly recommend picking up this thriller. After the first couple of chapters I had made decisions on all the characters involved… and they only ended up twisting and turning throughout the rest of the book, including my opinions on Rachel. Hawkins’ words are deliberate and well thought out, careful to never give away too much of the truth until it is absolutely necessary."
1543,Jillian Shiebler,"It took a little bit to get into it, but it intrigued me. Then I suddenly couldn't put it down. If I could, I would give it another half star for that alone. I was suspecting everyone at different points, which made me keep reading. Much better ending than Gone Girl too. Fast read and I enjoyed that it had different characters perspectives, but they were shorter and Rachel was still the protagonist. I could see it being a good movie too! Sometimes the characters seemed pathetic, and even though almost everyone hated Rachel (including herself), I found myself rooting for her. Left me feeling like I made the right choice with the way it ended."
1544,Monica Natu,This is one of those books that you cannot let go unless you have read the end. I felt the book dragged on a bit in the middle few pages. Nevertheless a very revetting read.
1545,Bob,"Slow start, difficulty with some dialogue, but the ending was worth the read"
1546,Carol ,"So many people compared this debut book to Gone Girl..Gone Girl was a terrible hate filled book..there, I said it. This book was hard for me to get into because of the ""other book""...Starts off with Rachel, an alcoholic and I thought of pitching it, but glad I continued. Gripping..tense..I did not like any of the characters..still a riveting story I just had to finish...Rachel is the girl on the train. The same daily dull trip until one day she saw something shocking that will change everything..."
1547,Jimmy,"Given the subject matter present here, so dark and murky at times a reader needs a halogen headlamp, it may sound a bit flippant to admit this book was a breath of fresh air. I've hit a dry patch with my reading in the past few weeks, it was just refreshing to find something that was engaging, good, and utterly unputdownable. There were parts of this book where I actually let out a scandalized ""Ooooh"" in the manner of a fifth grader watching cafeteria cat fight. It's the kind of book you find yourself taking breaks from not only to absorb and reflect on what's happening, but also to stretch it out a little longer to prolong the enjoyment.Thrillers tend to not be my cup of tea. When the plot focuses on the 'whodunit' rather than the 'whydunit' or 'howdunit', I lose interest if only because the question of 'who' is typically answered within the first few chapters. There's a quote out there, something about a shotgun prominently above the mantel in the first act must be fired in the third. In my experience, this is how the books of this genre typically seem to play out. (view spoiler)[There's not really a whole lot of mystery in the mystery book when you know the Big Bad is going to be one of the three or so main characters. (hide spoiler)] The comparisons between Girl on the Train and Gone Girl are inevitable, obvious and accurate...beyond pointing this out, I don't even want to say how or why the two are similar because I want to strictly avoid spoilers. Sufficed to say, the similarities go beyond breathless blurb hype about this Girl being the new Girl. In my opinion, Gone Girl's greatest strength was the journey, not the destination. When The Girl on the Train keeps the focus on the journey, on the characters themselves it is gripping and engaging and at times completely heartbreaking. A quick and dirty summary --not to sound lazy but I hate writing plot blurbs. The summary you read on the book's jacket or on Amazon is accurate. Go with that-- Rachel's life has gone down the crapper. She's a barely functioning divorced alcoholic. Recently fired from her job due to her drinking problem, Rachel still goes through the motions of her old routine by riding the train into the city every morning and home every evening, rather than come clean to the old college friend from whom she's renting a room. The route the train takes passes by Rachel's old neighborhood, passing by not only the house she shared with her ex husband but also a home occupied by two beautiful strangers. Catching only glimpses into the lives of these two people, Rachel invents a perfect fantasy for the two of them, only to have this fantasy shattered when...stuff happens. Making an effort to avoid spoilers while still discussing the book makes for a tricky review, what can I say.The characters are multilayered onions, their connections to one another are wickedly tangled. That is where the true twists and turns come with TGotT (can I abbreviate? I'm going to), not about the mystery behind the Big Bad but on the characters themselves. The reader's footing is never sure with anyone, three cheers for unreliable narrators. There are no clear cut good or bad guys because just as Rachel's perspective on the lives she invents for these people she sees ends up on it's ear, anything the reader determines about the character of the characters can shift dramatically. My absolute favorite characters in any book are the unlikable ones...not the cool anti-heroes, not the self insert blank slates, not the perfectly perfect Mary Sues. To me, tropes are hard sells. Give me a character that has actual flaws with a dose of ugly humanity any day of the week. And Rachel, the titular girl on train, is so damned dark. You switch from feeling extraordinarily sorry for her to being disgusted with her antics to wanting to give her a hug to wishing you could just shake her and demand she pull herself together.To state independently of motivation, the things these characters do are terrible. Not just Rachel but pretty much every single person featured. A laundry list of their sins include adultery, abuse, manipulation, cruelty, judgment, lying and more. They do terrible things, immoral things, things the gutcheck response might just be ""Oh, that is just unforgivable"". But then another layer is peeled off the onion, a little more is revealed and it suddenly becomes not so cut and dried, not so easy to assign blame or judgement. And yet, the terrible acts still stand. But! Throughout the book, there is explanation for the terrible things. Aside from the Big Bad, while there initially there is no demand for absolution (more on that in a second) for the terrible things there is at least understanding for why they were done in the first place.My only disappointment with the book came in the final quarter. Near the end it dissolves into a breathless, ""Woman in Jeopardy"" Lifetime movie. It stumbles and moves from understanding of the above mentioned terrible things to a rather hoary demand for both absolution and and then of course, redemption which I found heavy handed, disappointing.(view spoiler)[ Putting this behind a cut even though I'm going to vague it up...the who in whodunit is fairly obvious from the midpoint of the book, shotgun over the mantle style. All the same, at the end it was a let down to have the framing set up to explain why people did the things they did, explaining their actions and such, only to have the reasoning behind the Big Bad's actions be summed up more or less as ""Yup. This person is evil. Pure evil. Bake 'em away, toys."" And I don't know...maybe that's the point, in a Stampy the Elephant sort of way: Some people are just jerks.  (hide spoiler)]One of the reviews here on good reads says something along the lines of if you are considering this book, stop reading reviews and get it. I agree wholeheartedly. It wasn't without it's flaws, but this was an entertaining, gripping read. I really enjoyed it, I could definitely see this going on my re-read list and I look forward to seeing more of this author's work in the future."
1548,Mesmerizing Mehnaz,"This was an interesting read.It was faster paced and quite thrilling with lots of twists and turns.But in the end the the plot kinds of gave away itself.I mean if you can guess whats gonna happen next,then there's not much left to the story,is it?The writing is refreshingly amazing given this is her first time writing a novel.I liked the way she presented the characters.Now,about the comparison with Gone Girl,there's not much stuffs common between them,apart from them both being thrillers.Gone Girl had kind of an unique twist,whereas the twist in this plot has done many times before.All in all,I quite liked the book.I had to read it within a day given the suspense it was building up.And I can say it was worth it."
1549,Ron,"It’s a taught thriller of a book. I wanted to read it because of all the hype, and for the most part I understand why The Girl on the Train became such a phenomenon this year. For me, the juxtaposition of viewpoints was the strong attribute of the story. It’s what kept this book at a good pace, and actually helped to increase the intensity in the latter half of the book. If it wasn’t for alternating views, I probably would have become overly frustrated with the main character after the first 100 pages.The ending was slightly off for me, but in not disappointment. A great first book for this author."
1550,Rob,I actually really enjoyed this. It was a really easy read and despite predictable turns it dragged me out of a reading slump. Full video review here.
1551,Melero Guerrisa,Enthralling and fast paced. Great setup and narration. The ending could be less cheesy but overall a good summer read! 
1552,Catherine,I would rate this book 4.5 stars. Most of the book was the kind of thriller that I didn't want to put down so I finished it quickly and found it an engrossing read. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that there was some inconsistency in terms of the main character's (Rachel) relationship with her ex husband (Tom) and the ending of the book. (view spoiler)[ Right up until the end of the book Rachel views Tom very positively and remembers all the great parts about their relationship. He is described as if he is an empathetic person who left her because her drinking made her intolerable and he had just fallen in love with someone else. Then when he is revealed at the end to be basically a sociopath who just uses people for his own means it didn't ring true that Rachel (despite her alcoholic blackouts) wouldn't have had any memories of him that were anything other than positive or any warning bells that he had treated other people badly during their time together. For me this book would have been much more interesting if Tom's new wife Anna had turned out to be the murderer. (hide spoiler)]
1553,Evi G,"This is a great, well-written and well-crafted thriller... I read it in one day and did not want to put it down. Very gripping. The author draws you into the characters, you care about them even if, most of the time, you may not particularly like them.That said, I found the voices of the three women to be very similar; in fact, indistinguishable at times. And a bit old fashioned. At one point, Rachel says that women are only valued for their looks and their roles as mothers. All three women appear to value themselves only in relationship to a man. I suppose that women like this do still exist, but I do not happen to know any. "
1554,Ken Walker,"A fun, quick read. Not a real puzzler of a whodunit, but well-written with fully realized characters. I enjoyed it. "
1555,Barb,"This was a solid 4.5 stars for me.It grabbed me and kept me sucked in from start to finish. I devoured it.I enjoyed the shifting POV. It kept me on my toes. The three main women were fucked up and unstable, so they made really unreliable narrators ... which added to the mystery, to trying to figure out what was really going on.I won't say that the ending was a major shock. I had my suspicions, and near the end I just needed confirmation. Regardless, it was all wrapped up in a satisfying way."
1556,Reba,"Yes, I loved this. Loved the crazy, unreliable narrators. I just sat back and let them take for their whack-job, unstable ride. I liked that this was jumbled, but fast-paced, yet teeth-grindingly slow at times (OK, we get that Rachel is drunk...again) and whiplash fast at others. With some nice little red herrings, and characters you love to hate, once good thing is this book will sure make you feel better about yourself. One caveat...you will crave a gin and tonic, but think twice about actually having one. "
1557,Liz Keegans,"Wow! ""The Girl on the Train"" takes voyeurism to a whole new level. What a great story with lots of twists and surprises; all the way to the end. The story was intricate and the characters well developed. I found myself shaking my head, ""talking"" to the characters, getting angry and frustrated, being empathetic, hoping for a few different outcomes. But, be warned, once you start reading, this is a hard book to put down!!!"
1558,Lisa (Lost in Literature),"One unreliable narrator after another, this story is packed to the rim with confusion and doubt. I was constantly wondering what was going on, who was good, who was bad… all of it! All of these characters were flawed. All of them put doubts in my mind. And all of them had me questioning their every move.I was utterly void of any culprit guess throughout the entire story. I do have to say I’m the type of reader that doesn’t attempt to figure out the story. I just kind of go with it. So maybe that’s why I had NO IDEA who I should be hating on at any given moment. So many characters, all terrible in their own way… it was a pretty chaotic ride!I can’t say I was gripping my seat, terrified, wondering what was going to happen next. I didn’t really have that feeling at all (until closer to the end). It was much more suspenseful than thrilling to me. I was immediately drawn in and felt as if I was completely lost from page 1, yet I liked being lost. I was so eager to unravel this intricate weave of horrific events, characters, and scenarios one page at a time. It was definitely intense, and I was sucked right in.“I have lost control over everything, even the places in my head.”A powerful story filled to the brim with doubt, questions, and suspicions. A story that will make you question everything you know about everyone you’ve encountered, how quickly we form judgments on a person before we truly “know” them, and will surely have you feeling frustrated, disgusted, and even empathy at times. If you enjoy psychological thrillers, you won’t want to miss this one.Audiobook Impressions:All of these narrators were really great. My first time for each one. And though I honestly have difficulty with accents quite often, these three narrators quashed that issue of mine immediately. I would definitely recommend the audiobook for this story.(Thanks to Penguin Audio for the review copy!)Find this review and others like it at Lost in Literature!

1559,Liz Crowe,"In the wake of ""Gone Girl"" I can see how this book got so much attention. There really is nothing quite like an unreliable narrator, but this book is sort of not that. It is, however, a fast-past, well-structured-from-the-outside-in-to-the-solution style thriller.Three women are at the crux of this thing, that is staged around one woman's lonely daily trip into and out of central London on the train--a trip that is fake, since you come to find out she's been sacked from her PR job for being drunk at work, after being ditched by her husband for a hotter, more fertile replacement.It does not contain anyone you can really identify with, or ""like"" as I'm told by readers and editors that one ""must have,"" although ""Rachel"" is set up to be that. We've all been heartbroken by life and she is a sad sack for a lot of reasons that feel very realistic even though her cringe-worthy actions get a bit stale after a while. The novel's over-arching ""good girl"" vs. ""bad girl"" thing sort of bugged me once I figured out ""who did it."" But the author keeps you on the edge of your seat with a fast-paced narrative. Although you see the plot train coming, you can't stop watching so as to see how it all ends.I give it 4 stars here but it's really more a 3.5 in my mind. 5 stars for writing style, 2.5 for plot."
1560,Rafaeldavid29,"No mejor que Perdida, pero adictiva y entretenida (a pesar que la trama no se enfoca realmente en el misterio)"
1561,Ela,"""Das Leben ist kein Absatz und der Tod ist keine Klammer"" S. 19Es wurde viel Wind um ""Girl on the Train"" gemacht. Letztendlich konnte ich mich dem Buch nicht entziehen, da ich immer wahnsinnig interessiert daran bin, was wirklich hinter dem Hype steckt. Der Erzählstil der Geschichte gefiel mir gut. Die Szenen sind zeitlich abgegrenzt mit Datumsangabe sowie den Tageszeiten morgens/nachmittags/abends. Das war wie eine Art Tagebuch oder Protokoll der Ereignisse. Paula Hawkins erzählt die Geschichte aus der Sicht von Rachel, aus der von Jess, die eigentlich Megan heißt, sowie aus der von Anna, die neue Frau von Rachels Ex-Mann. Dabei gibt sie allen drei Frauen gleich viel Raum, sodass man nicht unbedingt nur von Rachel als Hauptprotagonistin ausgehen kann.Sie sind allesamt schwierige Charaktere, die beim Leser nicht unbedingt Sympathien wecken dürften. Rachel hat seit einigen Jahren mit einem Alkoholproblem zu kämpfen. Ihr Mann hat sie deswegen für eine andere verlassen und durch die Trinkerei hat sie auch ihren Job verloren. Sie versucht den Schein aufrecht zu erhalten, in dem sie immer noch so tut, als würde sie jeden Morgen zur Arbeit fahren. Sie steigt in den Zug, nur um abends wieder zu ihrer Mitbewohnerin zurückzukehren. Sie lebt eindeutig in ihrer eigenen Welt, was sich auch dadurch abzeichnet, dass sie sich diese Geschichten zu Megan und Scott alias ""Jess"" und ""Jason"" ausdenkt. Anfangs empfindet man vielleicht noch eine Art Mitleid für sie, aber sie begeht einfach immer und immer wieder dieselben Fehler, sodass man sie sehr schnell einfach nur schütteln möchte. Anna und Megan sind allerdings auch nicht unbedingt die Heldinnen des Romans. Megan hat ein traumatisches Erlebnis aus Jugendjahren nie wirklich verarbeitet, sodass sie bis heute nicht immer nachvollziehbare Sachen macht und Anna wirkt mit ihrer Paranoia und ihrem Beschützerinstikt um ihr Kind eher nervig. Je weiter man liest, desto mehr bekommt man das Gefühl, dass jeder hier in der Geschichte einen psychischen Knacks weg hat.Die Geschichte beginnt sehr langsam mit einer Einführung in Rachels Leben, ihren Gewohnheiten, ihrer Vergangenheit sowie ihrer Fantasie bezüglich Megan und Scott. Richtig interessant wurde das Ganze aber erst, als Megan plötzlich verschwindet. Rachel war an diesem Abend in der Nähe von Megan, hat aber keinerlei Erinnerung mehr daran, was passiert ist, weswegen sie der Sache auf den Grund gehen will. Sie versucht Stück für Stück zu rekonstruieren, was an diesem Abend geschehen ist, versucht die Lücken zu füllen und muss sich dafür nicht nur mit den letzten Tagen, sondern mit ihrer gesamten Vergangenheit auseinandersetzen und wie ihr Leben letzten Endes den Bach runter ging. Das Buch hat mich durchaus gefesselt und ich wollte schon wissen, was mit Megan passiert ist und was Rachel damit zu hat. Aber das Buch wies zwischendurch einige Längen auf, die es zu überbrücken galt, gerade wenn Rachel mal wieder dabei war sich zu betrinken und es mich leider überhaupt nicht mehr interessiert hat, was dann mit ihr passiert oder wie es ihr geht. Zum Schluss macht es die Autorin nochmal spannend, auch wenn ich mir relativ früh denken konnte, was passiert ist. Das hat dem ganzen ein bisschen den Spaß wieder genommen. Den Weg zur Lösung hat Paula Hawkins aber verständlich und lückenlos dargestellt ohne dabei zu übertreiben. AbschlusswortBei ""Girl on the Train"" nehmen vorallem die Charaktere viel Raum ein. Im Endeffekt erzählen sie alle auf ihre eigene Art und ihren Wahrnehmungen die gleiche Geschichte. Dabei ecken sie immer wieder an und manchmal ist ihnen offenbar nicht mehr zu helfen, sodass sie nicht unbedingt Sympathien wecken werden. Was das Ganze aber wiederum in einem interessanten Licht erscheinen lässt, da einem hier nicht die heile Welt vorgespielt wird, wie es sonst oft der Fall ist. Das Buch ist für mich kein richtiger Thriller, aber auch kein Krimi. Es ist eine Art Spannungsroman, der zwar einige Längen aufweist, sich aber um die alles entscheidende Frage was wirklich geschehen ist durchaus lesen lassen kann."
1562,Bree T,"Rachel takes the same commuter train to work every morning. It’s a slow one, often stopping at the same signal for minutes at a time. Rachel watches a house that backs onto the tracks and the couple that live inside. In her head she’s named them Jason and Jess and she’s constructed a whole life for them. In the summer she watches as they sit on a makeshift terrace, sipping coffee.Rachel tries to avoid looking several houses down from Jason and Jess’s house as that’s where she used to live. In the before. Before she started drinking so much she blacked out and woke up with gaps in her memories. Before she found out her husband Tom was having an affair. Before Anna moved in, with her growing belly.One day a headline catches Rachel’s attention. Jess’s real name is Megan and she’s missing. And the night she went missing, Rachel was lurking around the area, trying to talk to Tom again. But she was very drunk and even though she thinks she might know something, she has to unlock it from her brain. There are things that aren’t adding up…but who is going to trust a drunk who can’t let her ex-husband go?It seems like the publishing industry is always promising readers the next something. This one is marketed as Rear Window meets Gone Girl and I love the concept because I suspect that most people have a little Rachel in them. I don’t mean the drinking to excess (although some probably have that too) and the stalking the ex (ditto) but I think there are a lot of people out there, myself included, who have a bit of the voyeur. Rachel has seen a couple from the window of the train she takes every day and she’s constructed a whole life for them. She’s given them names (Jason and Jess), created careers for them, imagines what they get up to when they’re in other parts of the house where she can’t see them. She’s come to believe in them, feel like she knows them. In Rachel’s head, Jason and Jess are real people, almost like friends.Rachel has been on a downward spiral for years now with the ending of her marriage. She was already drinking before the end of it but now she just drinks more. She rents a room from her friend Cathy, who prides herself on her niceness but Rachel is testing even that with her behaviour. She drinks on the way home from work on the train, she drinks during the day. When she’s not thinking about Jason and Jess, she’s thinking about Tom. She leaves countless messages on his mobile, she calls the house repeatedly and in the middle of the night, she goes around there and stands in the street and has, on occasion, made more of a nuisance of herself than that. Rachel does and says a lot of things that she cannot remember and even though as a reader you feel sorry for her for the demise of her marriage, there’s no denying that quite frankly, Rachel is an absolute mess and at times warrants more disgust than pity. And yet there’s clearly something in her mind, just on the fringes, that Rachel cannot access. At times I feared for her wellbeing, like on the night she’s out near the train station closest to Jason and Jess (really named Scott and Megan) and all she has the next mornings are bruises, an injury on her skull that looks like she’s been deliberately hit and the vague recollection of a guy with red hair grabbing her arm.The Girl On The Train starts out with a glimpse into a dissolute and ruined life and inserts it into a mystery. The story gently guides you along in one direction before neatly presenting the first of many twists and turns. Chances are most people will figure it out before the end but sometimes, it’s not about the endgame. It’s about how you get there and I think that this book does a great job in constructing the story that takes you there. Rachel is so unreliable and so pathetic that you wonder just how she could possibly have the answer to what day it is, let alone much more than that. Told in three parts with points of view from Rachel, Anna and Megan, each of these characters are multifaceted and at times, utterly unlikable. Rachel should’ve moved away from the area when the marriage ended instead of taking the train every morning that takes her past her old house and allows her glimpses into her ex-husband’s new life. She definitely shouldn’t be calling, turning up, and on one occasion, going into the house. Anna gloried in her role as mistress and gave little to no thought to the woman that preceded her until she began to wonder if history was repeating itself. Megan has had a difficult past and she’s restless and reckless.The Girl On The Train is an interesting look at relationships and how very rarely are they what they seem. Rachel has memories of her marriage with Tom, she has constructed a relationship for Jason and Jess that differs from the reality. Anna, likewise has perceptions of her relationship with Tom and believes that things are truly different for them. She blames Rachel and her drinking, feels pity for Tom and what he had to put up with. People believe what they want to about others and especially about themselves. Things are always different when it’s you.This was a tight, enjoyable thriller that I had to read in a single sitting."
1563,Kitti Boesel,"I devoured this book. It is unlike anything I have read and was even frustrating at times. The main character has issues, to say the least, and you really just want to smack her sometimes. The story has enough twists to keep you guessing and I didn't figure things out until WAY towards the end after she has practically told you who did what. This book will have you rethinking how you view other people. I recommend it to most people, but if you get annoyed by weak main characters, this book will just make you crazy."
1564,Shai,"
Being someone who loves to people watch, and spends a lot of time catching trains... I obviously had to pick up this book.
Do you ever see someone and wonder what their life is like? Maybe you've created stories for people you see regularly on your daily commute, at school, or work. What if you saw them every day, living their exciting and wonderful life... only to have them suddenly disappear? Rachel is thrust into the middle of a dark and complicated whirlwind of relationships, betrayal and lies. She never thought anything bad would happen to her 'Jess & Jason', nor did she think she'd be connected in ways she'd never imagined. I didn't know a lot going into this book; only that it has been compared to Gone Girl (which I'm still yet to read), and I see it EVERYWHERE. For some reason, I was expecting a completely different story, but was still hooked regardless. From the first page, The Girl on the Train held me tightly and wouldn't let go until I'd read the last sentence. There were some slower parts in the middle, where things started to feel a bit repetitive and boring, but it soon picked up again and finished with a bang. Throughout the novel, we're presented with the perspectives of Rachel, Anna and Megan. I found it easy to differentiate their voices from one another, and enjoyed reading each of their chapters - though Rachel's (main character) was my favourite. I could really connect with how her mind worked - she's constantly observing people and creating stories for them, wanting to figure them out, wanting to solve things. Unlike Rachel however, I've never had a drop of alcohol, and she's a raging alcoholic. Hahaha. Because of this, she was a rather unreliable narrator at times, and I was confused and annoyed with a lot of the things she did, which ultimately made the situation worse... but it all added to the suspense throughout. I'll admit, just a little over halfway through the book, I knew what was going on and also what was going to happen, but it didn't spoil anything for me at all. I do have some unanswered questions regarding some of the characters and their relationships with one another, but nothing too major. Being her debut novel, Hawkins wrote an amazing, gripping and fast-paced story that definitely deserves the hype it's been getting.I'm definitely planning on reading any other books she releases in the future, and will at some point (soon, hopefully!) be picking up Gone Girl, because now I'm in the mood for thrillers. XD Definitely recommended!"
1565,Shan,"The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins is a debut novel that may just become the psychological thriller of 2015. I don’t read many thriller or mystery novels but I was hooked on this one from the start. It was my first book of 2015 and I devoured it all in one day.This book is already being compared to Gone Girl, The Silent Wife, and Before I Go To Sleep, and even though I have only read one of those (The Silent Wife), I can see why. This is going to be a talked-about book, in fact it already is. I don’t generally gravitate toward thrillers, I never felt the pull to read Gone Girl even when everyone was talking about it. But something about this book grabbed me when I read the blurb and it held on to me tightly from the very first page. The movie rights to the book were acquired by DreamWorks back in March, so you know that this is going to be one of the big books of 2015.You can read my full review here"
1566,Jenjaylu,I liked this book. Did seem similar to Gone Girl which I liked as well
1567,Stacey Cleworth,"On the surface, Rachel, the girl on the train, appears to be the ordinary commuter. Catching the same train every day, she observes life and in particular, the life of those who live in the trackside houses. Her journey provides an escape, it allows her to break away from her compulsive drinking, self pitying and relentless thoughts of her ex husband, Tom, and his new family – living in their old home.‘Jess and Jason’, a beautiful couple whose terrace balcony can be seen from the train, provide much entertainment for Rachel’s imagination – she feels as though she knows the intricate details of their perfect life at 15 Blenheim Road. Staggering through each day, Rachel provides an obsessive account of the couples life as she sees it. One day, she is shocked by what she sees. Shortly afterwards, she recognises the face of ‘Jess’ on the front of a newspaper – she has vanished. Between her alcoholism and blackouts, Rachel becomes knotted in the lives of the couple, attempting to tell the police everything she knows: the blue dress, the red-haired man, the underpass, her bleeding lip.Emulating Gillian Flynn’s Gone Girl, Hawkins demonstrates the gripping nature of juggling perspectives, including the flawed and undependable protagonist. The Girl on the Train builds unanticipated empathy, alluring characters, enthralling twists, guesses and second guesses. A compulsive 8 out of 10.For more of my book reviews: www.writingaboutreading101.wordpress.com"
1568,Ju Haghverdian,"3.5 starsHaving the habit of not reading about a book before reading it, I had no idea what this story was about but after all the buzz about it I was expecting something more disturbing than Gone Girl. I feel a bit disappointed because although the story is kind of creepy, it is far from the amount of distress I felt after reading Gone Girl.I couldn't sympathize with any of the characters, they were annoying and miserable in their own way, creepy and overbearing.I have no respect for cheaters so Megan and Tom were even more repulsive to me... Anna is included in the cheaters category by association.I just couldn't understand why Rachel was mislead all that time, come on, don't you talk to your friends or wouldn't you try to find out if you really did all that crap to try to apologize or something?! “I felt isolated in my misery. I became lonely, so I drank a bit, and then a bit more, and then I became lonelier, because no one likes being around a drunk. I lost and I drank and I drank and I lost.”It took me a long time to be sure who it was, it wasn't that predictable this time but after the truth is out the development was quite a downer, I was expecting a smarter explanation than that and a more exciting turn of events... a real twist. Just comes to show that the grass is not always greener... appearances can definitely be deceiving."
1569,Kitty,"Yes, I got sucked in and bought a book that's been #1 on the bestseller's list for a couple months. Did it live up to the hype? In a way, yes. Once it got going, the plot was fast-paced and had lots of twists and turns, reminding me of an episode of Dateline NBC. The weird thing is that I never really liked any of the characters or was rooting for them in any way. I think it's unusual that I give a four star rating to a book with characters I didn't like. If you're looking for a book with sex, violence, deception and alcohol abuse (sounds like Dateline, doesn't it?), this is the book for you. "
1570,Megan,"This book is exactly as advertised, a fast paced, psychological thriller. Great read!"
1571,Estefanía,"Primero que nada quiero aclarar que es un 4.5El libro me gusto, la trama y como te lleva a querer terminarlo de una vez por todas.La lectura es ágil, rápida de leer. Me encanta la esencia que da al ya creer que tienes al culpable y al final resulta que no es. El libro es bueno en sí, pero no es lo que esperaba, durante todo el libro de hace tener altas expectativas del final pero no resulta lo que realmente querías para el final. Igual y me hubiese gustado que hubiera un corto epílogo. No me arrepiento de leerlo, es una buena lectura para pasar el rato, ya que te cautiva desde la sinopsis.(Es mi primer reseña, no me critiquen, buenos si pero criticas constructivas)"
1572,Marianne Meyers,"A good thriller, pulls you right in. I always like it when a narrator waffles between being trustworthy or untrustworthy, it makes the story more interesting, and I find myself questioning all that has happened. "
1573,Hillary Pincus,"What a ride! Ms. Hawkins ""The Girl on the Train"" did a great job of keeping me hooked in this ""whodunit"". I felt for the characters (by felt I mean a range of feelings from disgust to sympathy) though I can't say that I LIKED any of them. They all pissed me off pretty well at one point or another, but I think that adds to this selection for me. Not a fan of the characters (though character development was well-done), but was still eager to find out the truth!Great read!"
1574,Nadine,"“Life is not a paragraph, and death is no parenthesis.” The Girl on the Train follows Rachel as she commutes on the same train everyday. On the train she looks out the window and sees a couple living in a house. Rachel makes up a life for them and goes as far as to give them names, jobs, and personality traits. One day she sees something that changes her view of the fictional couple. She decides to go to the police with the information, but she soon realizes that she's made the situation worse.I read this book because of the comparison to Gone Girl. I wanted to read something similar to Gone Girl (the awful characters, plot twist, etc.). In my opinion, The Girl on the Train is not as good or as well plotted as Gone Girl but it is still cohesive and twisted story worth the read.The writing style in this book is what makes the book worth reading. It is written in diary format that oscillates from morning to evening. There are big portions of the story missing and the writer of the diary selects what portions are told to the reader and which are omitted. It also allows the characters to reveal information selectively. As a reader you think you know the full story, but a few chapters later you realize that you don't know the full story and you were only fed bits and pieces. This realization makes the reader second guess the information being told and the character. The characters in this book are written with precision. The author did a fantastic job of making the reader feel sympathy for the main character then slowly change your opinion about her. You feel one way about her at the beginning of the book, but by the end you feel something else entirely. The pacing of this book is slow, which is not a bad thing. The focus of this story is on the characters and their actions and thoughts. Sip this story like a hot cup of tea because you'll appreciate it more. So just enjoy the narrative, slow pace, and story as it slowly unfolds.Overall, The Girl on the Train is an interesting read about people. Do not expect a thrill ride with an incredible mystery. This book is first and foremost about people. Enjoy the writing, the characters, and the plot as it slowly unfolds. Sit back and enjoy the ride!"
1575,Christy Esmahan,I really enjoyed this book. From the first page I could tell that the narrator was crazy--and I wanted to find out what happens. Very entertaining!
1576,Kristin (KC),"4.5 StarsAnother fast-paced psychological thriller that kept me glued to its pages!If you're a fan of Gillian Flynn’s twisted, artful, and suspenseful storytelling, I’d recommend checking out The Girl on the Train.Have you ever gazed through the window on a train and wondered what the people living in those houses you pass are doing with their lives? Perhaps you’ve conjured up your own theories, mentally orchestrating their daily occurrences all while longing to obtain the security you've imagined they possess?Rachel’s life has become entirely engulfed by these sorts of daydreams, zeroing in on one couple in particular — a couple she spots daily out on their terrace during her train ride into work. Rachel sees them as beautiful and happy; peaceful and together. All that she is not. As Rachel’s once happy life devolves into a nightmare of alcoholism and loneliness, she finds solace in these quiet minutes on the train. But when her path crosses with the “perfect” people of her daydreams, Rachel gets a chilling dose of reality… All is not always as it seems, and everyone is harboring a secret.While this book offers a mysterious, edgy chain of events sure to keep you guessing, you’re not likely to build a bond with its characters. Each of them are flawed and contribute to a largely heavyhearted plot. But it doesn’t seem we’re meant to fall in love with this cast, and I don’t believe this will hinder your connection to the story. This author’s writing is polished, her ideas are well-constructed, and she displays powerful themes that do not need the aid of repetition to be recognized or appreciated. The story is told in first person, and alternates between the candid and often morbid perspectives of three women whose lives eventually interlink. I had a hard time putting this book down. A must-read for all you psychological thriller lovers!

One for sorrow, two for joy, three for a girl, four for a boy, five for silver, six for gold, seven for a secret never to be told. I’ve got a few of those…

1577,Smelleykins,"This book had such a good PR run. Like it was everywhere. There was so much hype about it, everyone wanted to read it. Me included. I waited a few weeks or so before i decided to buy it and it's really rare i buy a book and read it with a week or two. But figured this would be a quick read. I wasn't wrong. The Girl On The Train is described as the next Gone Girl. Whilst I've never read that book before, I cant' comment. However it's addictive. It does shout out to be read in one sitting, it's a page turner. It's classed as a thriller, I'm unsure if it really is such. It does have the whole drama and suspense in it and mystery but is it scary enough to be a thriller. Probably not.The story is told via three different view points Rachel, who is the girl on the train. Megan and also Anna. The characters are so different, one minute they're likeable, the next you can't stand them. They're real. Rachel is just a raving alcoholic, Megan is the girl Rachel views from the train everyday. Anna is the one who got the husband. They're just three totally messed up women who through some crazy times, are brought together in a way they probably never expected. Their lives are turned upside down and they're sad, lonely, crying out for attention. They're just human.It wasn't until the last probably 30 odd pages, I really understood what was happening, what brought everyone together. It wasn't what i was expecting either. I think that was a good thing. I like being surprised, I love not guessing halfway through a book at the ending. So well done on that. I didn't love the book and I can't say why because I just don't know. Perhaps because of all the hype, a reader sometimes goes into a book expecting great things. I think it failed on that but I'm not sure why. There seemed something missing and I can't say what. It was good. Does the book live upto it's hype, I guess it depends on the reader. I can see this being made into a film though."
1578,Cheyanne,"Rachel, the ""girl on the train,"" is a completely original and unlikely sleuth. Divorced, depressed, alcoholic, and obsessed with her ex-husband, she tortures herself with glimpses of her old home and neighborhood as she commutes to and from London by train. Then she becomes convinced she has witnessed something sinister and her fixation shifts from mooning over her ex to solving a crime. As an investigator, she is hampered not only by her complete lack of training, naiveté, and emotional involvement, but also by occasional drunken blackouts that make it difficult for her remember the clues she's stumbled upon. Yet, I found Rachel increasingly endearing as she struggles courageously to uncover more than one terrible secret. The narrative shifts between her point of view and that of two other women who are essential to the plot but less interesting as characters. The novel has a few flaws-- the final confrontation is a bit too drawn out and melodramatic and the denouement a bit too quick and neat for my taste-- but these are minor quibbles. All in all, it's a well-told story with an unconventional heroine."
1579,Niki Mclaren,"Unreliable narrator's are the best kind! I am going to give this one four stars because I couldn't put it down. There were a few things I could get nitpicky about but it isn't worth it. It was interesting and fast paced, and I don't think there is a lot more you can ask for in a thriller."
1580,Deanne,"I may be rating The Girl on the Train a bit high. While I wouldn't exactly call it an outstanding work of literature, I am giving it 4 stars based on the fact that I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. There have been quite a few books that I've read lately that I felt like I was slogging through, so this book was really a welcome change. It was intriguing from the start and had good flow throughout. No slogging whatsoever!This book has been compared to Gone Girl quite a bit, and it may be similar in terms of popularity and likelihood of becoming a major motion picture. On the other hand it's quite a bit different in that while there are ""twists,"" it's not ""twisted."" My only criticism would be that I thought the outcome may have became apparent a tad too early, but other than that, I thought the plot was very well constructed. No good can come from my revealing any more details here, so I'll just say that I would highly recommend this to anyone in the mood for a thrilling, yet quick and easy read. It would be the perfect book to take with you on the plane."
1581,Helen Dunn,Great murder mystery told from various POV and primarily from the view of an unreliable narrator.While I can't say that I was completely blindsided by the developments I didn't guess them early and enjoyed every second as they played out before me.This will be my suggestion for those asking what book to read on vacation this summer. 
1582,Shelley Giusti,Compelling and intense! Will keep you on the edge of your seat until the last page.
1583,Barbpie,a gripping page-turner à la Gone Girl (but better) and set in England. 
1584,Denise Cowling,Great read! Disappointed with the ending. Worth reading.
1585,Anita Pomerantz,"The Girl on the Train is a well structured psychological suspense story. It follows three women, Rachel, Megan, and Anna. Megan and Anna live in the same neighborhood abutting a train track. Rachel rides by their homes each day on the train. Their lives are entwined from the start, and when one of the three goes missing, the suspense level ratchets up. Hawkins does a great job of creating flawed characters and revealing their stories in a way that will make you keep reading. There have been a lot of comparisons to Gone Girl, but frankly I thought Gone Girl was more original and had more twists. But The Girl on the Train is well crafted and ultimately satisfying - - Hawkins knows how to tell a story. Personally, I didn't think there was anything especially literary about this book, but if you are just looking for a good pleasure read, I'd recommend it. Perfect for a vacation, a plane ride, or the beach!"
1586,Ellie Lloyd,"For the majority of this book I just kept thinking, I'm only going to be able to rate this book as 2 or 3 stars. It had such good reviews that I was expecting it to be amazing from the beginning. It wasn't. For the first 60% of the book I kept debating with myself of whether I should finish it or just give up because I found it rather repetitive and tediously slow. Nothing was particularly happening. Nothing was getting resolved, and there wasn't really anything new happening. But then I hit the 60% mark and it really began to pick up. I read the last section of the book in less than a day, I didn't want to put it down. I loved the ending, the way that it didn't just happen but crept in slowly over the course of the second half. There was always the possibility that it would go that way, but it was slim. So when it did it was both shocking and exciting. For a book that I previously couldn't wait to finish and get it over with, I was suddenly extremely anxious to find out what happened. I was eager to reach the end. I guess, the last 40% is why I bumped my rating up to 4 stars and I have to say that I am pleased that I did decide to persevere and finish this book!"
1587,Jefna,"unreliable narrator, good building tension, blackouts and foggy memory, jealousy, alcoholism, murder...a good mixture to keep me turning the pages."
1588,Janette Fleming,"Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning. Every day she rattles down the track, flashes past a stretch of cozy suburban homes, and stops at the signal that allows her to daily watch the same couple breakfasting on their deck. She’s even started to feel like she knows them. “Jess and Jason,” she calls them. Their life—as she sees it—is perfect. Not unlike the life she recently lost.And then she sees something shocking. It’s only a minute until the train moves on, but it’s enough. Now everything’s changed. Unable to keep it to herself, Rachel offers what she knows to the police, and becomes inextricably entwined in what happens next, as well as in the lives of everyone involved. Has she done more harm than good?Compulsively readable, The Girl on the Train is an emotionally immersive, Hitchcockian thriller and an electrifying debut.>"
1589,Kirty Vedula,"A mystery that works because of the feverish narration and sheer unpredictability (until about 70% of the book). I would not call it a classic, yet it is an exhilarating one-sitting read. I don't know if its because of the setting or a bit of domesticity - but I found a tinge of Sophie Kinsella in this author. Who knew? :D"
1590,Elizabeth Joseph,"4.5/5When I started reading this book with too many flawed characters, I was not sure if I was going to like this. Rachel's character who is the main narrator seemed to be absolutely horrible and I hated her. But slowly I got pulled into the story and there was no way I could put this book down.A great thriller and it is too fast paced that you just get carried the way Paula Hawkins wants you to!Full Review here "
1591,Bria,"This book started out slow as hell. Listening to a drunken fat lady staring out of train window didn't seem very enticing, but once she started acting on her fantasies (and no one can create a fantasy world quite like a drunk can!), the book picked up pace quickly.Sitting with strangers always creates this heavy awkward silence and people are all trying their best to be like rocks and give nothing away and not look at each other. And yet we are all curious about the people next to us and who they are and what they do. So we make stuff up! But.....drunken Rachel actually goes and talks to and gets involved with the strangers she makes up fantasies about!! Which seemed hilarious and like a train wreck (ugh couldn't help that bad pun) waiting to happen.And naturally it did! Everything Rachel could have messed up she did, mainly because she spends her whole life being drunken and confused, plus she got hit on the head countless times....but she was still interesting and compelling. She is trying to figure out what's going on so fervently that as a reader you can't help but cheer her on and speed through the pages so you can find out too!! Plus it's always fun to have a slightly unreliable narrator like Rachel (or like the other two female narrators) because they act like normal people and see things their own selfish narrow-minded way which adds to the confusion and mystery of the book.After this book I....1. Am never going to trust those random people that try to talk to me in supermarkets or gas stations because you never know what nice face could be hiding a cheating lying killer2. Never go on blind dates (same reason as number one)3. Keep my weird fantasies to myself so I don't end up beaten and drunk4. Buy a gun before I confront someone with murder (so I don't end up beaten and drunk...or dead)Hahahahaha! But seriously though, Rachel and this book is light years better than Gone Girl (which I didn't like at all). Also I probably should have listened to Carrie Underwood's Black Cadillacs song on repeat while I read this...."
1592,Carrie ,"Have you ever driven by stretches of houses wondering what life was like behind those walls? Now imagine driving past them daily, the stories you can make up in your own mind of the people inside, their lives, even giving them names. What happens when you see something, something that changes how you think of these people. What do you do? What do you do when you don't know who to trust? When everything is lie, or everything is a black hole because you can't bear the reality so you drink away the time, faking the life you live because telling the truth of what really is too hard to face. This book makes you take a look at others, realizing that what you see on the outside isn't always what is. What a page turner, I was constantly wondering and in the dark until the last 50 page or so. I started to think hmm maybe, and it turns out my suspicions were correct. Highly recommend this book."
1593,Sarah *on hiatus*,"Believe the hype.I read this in a few sittings. It was insanely addicting and mysterious. Reminds me a bit of Gillian Flynn who writes flawed, unlikable and bitter females. I love the connections between the characters and even though I guessed the twist, I was never really sure and wanted to keep reading. And it's becoming a movie!Starring two of my favorites: Rebecca Ferguson (a Swedish actress who outshone everyone in the last Mission Impossible movie) and Emily Blunt (I have such a celebrity crush on her after The day after tomorrow. SQUEAL.)Recommended for those who like mysteries and thrillers with a good dose of drama."
1594,Santie,I really liked it but not as earth shatteringly good as reviews made me believe.
1595,Redfox5," I've just come back from a holiday in beautiful La Palma. I stayed at the amazing La Palma princess hotel and I was really excited when I saw a bookshelf in reception where people could exchange their books. I had brought 5 books with me, and as there was lots of laying about in the sun, I raced through them. Which means I had a chance to take some from the Bookshelf :) I picked this one as you would have to be living under a rock to not notice this book creeping about in book stores. It does live up to the hype. It's really gripping, the way it unfolds, not like I thought it would be at all. We've all been that girl on the train(well a sober version) and wondered about the lives of the people who live along the rail tracks or our fellow commuters. When I used to get the train to college, a girl in red coat used to get on everyday. I always wondered about her and I never even said hello. I've been Rachel(again a sober version) and I've been Anna so I could sympathize with them both, however two years is way too long to still be depressed about a relationship ending! Get over it girl! Good job Cathy is so nice, as I would have kicked Rachel out ages ago. I wasn't expecting the ending and I loved how everything started falling into place, an awesome book! "
1596,Ti,"*No Spoilers*The Short of It:A nosy woman on the train witnesses something odd and decides to look into it further.The Rest of It:This book is a lot of fun. Lots of page turning, plenty of twists and a classic unreliable narrator. Good stuff.Rachel is an alcoholic and has lost her job. She rides the train all day to keep her roommate from knowing that she’s now unemployed. Her train happens to pass by the house she once owned with her husband, Tom. Tom is now married to Anna and they live happily in what was once her home. Rachel’s train ride through London is often spent tipping a bottle back. Seeing her old home and sometimes even catching a glimpse of the other woman, is enough to make her drink and drink she does. So much so, that what she sees is often not remembered later.That memory thing becomes a problem early on.Yes. It. Does.Rachel’s daily observances include a couple that she’s come to know as Jess and Jason, names she’s made up to give them substance. She watches them interacting on the balcony of their apartment, and she’s dreamed up a back story for them. But when Jess does something out of character for her, and then a crime is committed, Rachel takes it upon herself to investigate.As you can imagine, things get out of hand. Rachel sticks her nose into their lives and in the process, ends up involving her ex-husband and his wife. Both, really want nothing to do with Rachel but out of obligation, aware of Rachel’s raging alcoholism, Tom tries to look out for her when he can, which infuriates Anna.Tension mounts as the story unfolds and when you get to those last few chapters, you can’t help but turn the kids away, let your dinner burn, etc. The ending needs to be read uninterrupted. Don’t tell me that I didn’t warn you.But, honestly, Rachel’s antics were a little tiring. Just when I started to grow bored with her, some critical piece of info would surface and then I’d be flipping pages again. I suppose that’s a sign of true suspense because there was no way I was going to put the book down. I knew that from the start. Does it deserve the hype? Yes, I think so. If you pick it up for pure fun, you will enjoy it quite a bit. If you pick it apart and compare it to other books, you might find fault with some of it but really, who has the time for that?Read it, because it’s fun and it’s a great distraction from all the crap going on in the world today.For more reviews, visit my blog: Book Chatter."
1597,Linda,"I saw reviews of this book that were all over the map from ""thrilling, stunning,"" etc., to ""I was so disappointed."" So I was not sure whether it was worth reading.But I read it.It's a very interesting book. I really liked the way it was structured: told from the point of view of the women involved with nothing from the men, since most of them were suspects.Our narrator is not a very sympathetic character. She is an alcoholic who suffers from blackouts. One of those occurred the night a woman, subsequently found murdered, is abducted and in the same area. Rachel commutes daily to London even though she was fired from her job and makes up stories about a couple she sees nearlyn everyday who live in her old neighborhood. She fantasizes about getting back with her ex-husband, who is remarried with a young child, and harrasses him with emails, phone calls and visits to the neighborhood. His wife is frightened of her.But Rachel has lovely fantasies about the couple - Jason and Jess she calls them.Then one day she sees Jess with another man, who appears to kiss her passionately. When ""Jess"" disappears, Rachel feels that she needs to contact the police, and eventually, the husband to let them know. She is declared an ""unreliable witness"" due to her alcoholism and stalking of her ex. But she manages to insert herself into the investigation. It's the first time she feels like not drinking.Apparent guilt shifts constantly, especially when her body is found beaten and murdered. Rachel seems to have ""memories"" of the night Jess disappeared, but they may be ""false"" memories since she suffered a blackout that night.Rachel persists. She visits Jess's former counselor. She visits and is befriended by Jess's husband (until he finds out she DIDN'T know Jess and is alcoholic and stating that she knows something about that night even though she was suffering a blackout.In spite of her good intentions, Rachel manages to make the investigation more complex than it needs to be. Her convictions switch from the husband (it couldn't be, she thinks. He's not capable.) to the ""other man"" she saw who MUST be guilty.The ending is good except for one thing. I'm constantly amazed that these killers seem to have to unburden themselves completely to their last ""victim."" I realize this is the way the author tells us how it happened and I also realize that some killers do unburden themselves but rarely to the extent that fiction killers do. In this book, it seemed especially jarring to me.But the killer was unsuspected. And the final resolution was great.It's definitely worth reading."
1598,Janeka,"Classificação: 4,5 estrelasNão acho que seja o livro ou o thriller do ano, mas é uma boa e rápida leitura - com algumas revelações surpreendentes e outras que, bem, se estava mesmo à espera,"
1599,Jo-anne Atkinson,"Rachel is a mess, she is an alcoholic and has lost her husband. Maintaining the pretence to all around her that she still has a job she commutes to London daily, always on the same train, the train that passes behind her old marital home. On the same street, just where the train pauses at a signal, live a young couple and Rachel fantasises about their life together. One day she sees the woman kiss another man and is upset, that weekend the woman disappears. Rachel is concerned about what happened and this is compounded by the fact that Rachel saw the woman on the night she disappeared. Unfortunately Rachel was drunk at the time and can only see a few flashbacks in her memory. What happened to Megan and can Rachel put the pieces together in time.I started this book with complete scepticism, comparisons with 'Gone Girl' abound and I like my books to have an original twist. Up till halfway through the book I felt it dragging a little. Then something changed, I'm not sure what, and this became a nail-biting thriller. There are twists aplenty and whilst the ending is neat, it leaves a little bit more. Rachel is not a sympathetic character, there isn't a single one in the book, and that's why it works. In the end this draws on the originality of Gone Girl but takes it to a new place and Hawkins has written with restraint. A deserved popular read."
1600,Saumil,"Welcome to the world of messy, alcoholic, lying female narrators whom you cannot trust at all. Rarely have I read a book in recent times that didn't reveal the real stuff up until the last 30-40 pages. It made you turn page after page even though the situations shown in the book were disgusting. When I started reading it, it looked like a rip-off of Gone Girl and I thought I'd go on hating this book, but it was even creepier than Gone Girl, and that says something and I actually liked this one. The characters are really well created and it keeps you guessing up until the last moment who the real culprit is. The first person narrative with different timelines of each character gave the book a different dimension altogether. For a thriller, the most important thing is to not reveal too much information too early and for a debut author Paula Hawkins did a really good job with this, and kept you glued to the book till the last. "
1601,May,"This was REALLY hard to put down (uh, it's 4 AM) and I kept wanting to read more and needing to KNOW more, so the author has definitely succeeded in that. It does really drive home the point of the unreliable narrators and (maybe it's just me but) I think it did a good job at keeping things under wraps. However, at some points, I kinda went, well this is clearly meant to be a new Gone Girl/clearly this is written to make a good movie (and it will definitely make a good movie). Still, tho, given the fact that I read it all and I couldn't stop reading it, even though it FREAKED ME OUT, I think people should definitely check it out."
1602,Max,"At first I thought everyone was terrible. Not one of the characters were redeeming in the least. Tom - cheating on his wifeScott - mentally abusiveRachel - an alcoholicMegan - cheating on her husbandAnne - the mistressLooking back over the book, nope, no one was redeemable in the end besides maybe Rachel and Anne. I mean they both were terrible people, but they had been expertly manipulated. Perhaps the reader is manipulated as well, thinking that Rachel is even more terrible than what she actually appears to be, thanks to the words and thoughts of Tom. I'd say that even if I hated everyone, there have been few books that have made me turn the page so quickly to find out exactly what happened next. Perhaps I was hoping for a neatly tied up ending that was never going to come. Or perhaps I was surprised, because I thought Anne was manipulated enough to go along with Tom's plan. Surprised that she would drive the ""dagger"" deeper into the wound. I guess I'm just glad it wasn't some weird outside character that committed the crime. Neither the therapist or the old boyfriend were the causes of Megan's death, but she sure was naive. "
1603,Lynette Jones,"I will start by saying that this is a well written book . My only complaint is that the main character is an alcoholic and the reader spends a lot of time watching her drink, cry in her gin and regret it the next day. In defense of the character I believe the author has caught the life of an addict quite well. But, it isn’t my favorite type of reading.That being said, this book is a good mystery with a bit of thriller thrown in to the mix. Rachael is the girl on the train. She rides the train every day into the city and every day she rides it home again. The train she takes passes the house where she used to live before her husband left her for another woman. As she rides the train, she has noticed the couple who lives in the house a few doors down and has started creating a fantasy life around them.Every day on the train, Rachael has several Gin and Tonics and several more on the way home. Then a few more when she gets home from the bottle she hides in her room. She is beginning to have black outs and forget what she has done while she has blacked out. Often, she calls her ex-husband and cries on his shoulder or alternately she screams at him. His wife, has had enough of Rachael and wants her out of their lives.One day Rachael notices that the woman in her perfect couple is kissing another man on the patio where she habitually sees them as she passes by on the train and this begins to shatter her fantasy about this couple. Then the woman disappears. Rachael tells the police what she has seen and what she thinks she knows, but they dismiss her as an unreliable witness once they investigate her background.The story is told in three voices Rachael, Anna and Meghan. Anna is the woman who stole Rachael’s husband away, Meghan is the woman from the balcony. As each woman tells their story, the story of who is killed and why is slowly unfolded. The story of Rachael trying to unravel the truth behind the death, and her part in it, becomes clear.This story delves deeply into the lives of three very different women and the problems that are troubling them as they live what appears to be very normal lives. The layers are slowly peeled back and as the depths are revealed, so are the secrets that each of the women are hiding. When all the secrets have been revealed, it is clear who the killer is and why murder was the option chosen to deal with the problem.This story deals with adult themes and situations that people find themselves in when their lives begin to spin out of control. An interesting read and a good story."
1604,Yvonne,"This book had way too much narration with lots of telling instead of showing but it was nonetheless compelling enough to keep me going for a quick read. We spend the time in the heads of three very flawed major characters, Rachel, Anna and Megan with the main one being the alcoholic Rachel.She is quite an annoying character in many ways. In fact, no one in here is particularly sympathetic which in a way made it easier to enjoy the storyline. You're almost guaranteed a good ending no matter how it turned out. Still, you end wanting to know what happened to all of them on that July day in 2013. The results of course, is not really all that surprising but ended up being a good albeit simple yarn. "
1605,Melissa T,"Very suspenseful! The characters are not to be trusted and I suspected each of them at one point or another. Just when I thought I had it figured out, something happened to make me suspect someone else and that's how I like it. This book is often compared to Gone Girl, but other than the suspense and the characters having issues that make them seem untrustworthy, I don't really see the comparison. But I liked it on its own and would recommend it to fans of psychological thrillers. "
1606,Michael Waters,"Extremely clever and really well paced. Proof that a thriller doesn't need one large ""Wow"" moment, but rather a bunch of smaller twists, in order to be unputdownable. Best of all, there is a point toward the middle of this book where I realized I did not trust a single character. Everyone in this book seems guilty, when you look at them from the right light."
1607,Skye Skye,"A haunting tale of three women, three men---one treacherous and deceitful; multiple narratives ingeniously spliced together and told via the vantage point of a train. Ms. Hawkins' exquisite prose breathes life and a myriad of emotions into each inner dialogue and casts a spell of inquisitive suspense and wonder within the reader. The conclusion was predictable and that drops my rating from five stars to four and half..One point I found fascinating is the author manages to convey how frequently we gaze at other people's lives with secret longing and hidden envy, but the reality is that we all have private, dark areas and life is never what it seems to someone else. I loved this."
1608,AJ,"Enjoyed the hell out of this book, even while it was freaking me out. The characters are complex and all vaguely unlikable, which is a nice change from the Mary Sue's I've been getting in a lot of other books. There's enough humanity in them to make them if not sympathetic, then logically cohesive. The AHA plot moment was a little Plot Ex Machina for me, but thinking back there was some foreshadowing that I could have paid more attention to. While I nothing'd the format (kind of clever, a little tedious), I really liked the writing style. Looking forward to future books by this author, hopefully!"
1609,Stacie,Great read! About 20% to go and will not sleep until I know who killed Megan!!!Started reading late last night and spent most of today reading.... Riveting!
1610,Minty McBunny,"Wow! This book was quite a ride, I literally struggled to put it down at bedtime and spent the whole next day finishing. The only reason I knocked off a star was that the climactic ending felt a bit contrived, I certainly hope the identity of the killer was not meant to be a surprise, but I definitely enjoyed Rachel's character, the suspense was excellently crafted and the pacing was spot on. Very impressive for a debut. "
1611,Patrícia,"Opinião completa, aqui:http://pedacinho-literario.blogspot.c... Observa. As casas. As árvores. Assimila. A paisagem. As pessoas. Sente. Inveja. Ciúme. Felicidade... ?Uma janela, uma breve passagem, rápida, veloz, pode desvendar mil e um segredos, desenhar mil e uma possibilidades, desencadear mil e um acontecimentos. Rachel bem o sabe – de toda a vez que o comboio pára no sinal, de toda a vez que tem um vislumbre da Jess e do Jason, a sua mente transforma a realidade que desconhece em algo íntimo, só seu. Mas Rachel sabe também que essa fantasia pode mudar de um momento para o outro, e quando tal acontece, o mundo que a rodeia, o presente em que sobrevive, pode não ser forte o suficiente para que a sua voz seja ouvida, as suas palavras levadas em conta, o seu testemunho credível. A Rapariga no Comboio trata-se de um thriller contado a três perspectivas mas é Rachel quem domina a narrativa com o seu discurso imprevisível e, tantas vezes, traiçoeiro. Acreditar naquilo que ela vê e no que julga recordar – breves e turvas memórias de um estado embriagado – é um desafio psicológico para o leitor, mas também o é o enigma em torno do desaparecimento súbito de Megan, e a felicidade – falsa?, verdadeira? – de Anna. Cada uma destas três mulheres sofre à sua maneira, vítimas de um casamento falhado, de um passado traumatizante e de um futuro inseguro. E cada uma destas três mulheres vive em torno de algo humano, algo palpável, algo como a pertença a um lugar, a alguém. Rachel quer ser uma pessoa melhor mas não sabe como, quer recuperar algo que perdeu sabendo que tal nunca será possível; Megan quer largar o passado e concentrar-se num casamento que tanto lhe traz alegria quanto tristeza, que tanto lhe esboça um sorriso nos lábios como a afugenta; e Anna quer finalmente ter a sua família feliz, o seu núcleo de conforto mesmo que para isso certas medidas – mais bruscas, mais radicais – tenham de ser tomadas. Um enredo feito, quase por inteiro, de personagens, esta foi uma surpresa pela qual nunca esperei. O sucesso que envolve A Rapariga no Comboio encontra-se visível em cada página percorrida, cada capítulo único, cada segredo revelado e cada reviravolta vertiginosa. Os acontecimentos sucedem-se em catadupa, assim como as dúvidas e os dilemas, ao mesmo tempo que Rachel tenta juntar as peças de um puzzle que em tudo se mostra incompleto, impossível de resolver.Enquanto leitores, somos transportados para uma Londres sombria onde nada é o que parece e tudo é provável; mas enquanto curiosos, somos levados a indagar sobre a identidade do verdadeiro vilão, sobre o que aconteceu em tão turbulenta noite, e sobre o que poderá vir a ser das vidas destas personagens tão absolutamente singulares e tão estranhamente arrepiantes e palpáveis.

1612,Cindy,Slow start but fast ending! 
1613,Gabriel Garcia,"""The Girl on the Train"" by Paula Hawkins, is a thrilling book viewed from a women who lost pretty much everything in her life. Rachel the main character in the book, is a women who takes the train around London every morning. She soon started becoming an alcoholic after her ex-husband Tom left her. Now she just travels around London, usually passing by her old house, and neighborhood. She stares at the people and the couples. However, it was specifically one couple she paid attention to. Their names were Jess and Jason, the perfect couple that Megan had once been apart, and now dreamed about. However the couple wasn't as perfect as she thought they were. There real names were Megan and Scott, and now Megan was missing. Now Rachel gets right in the middle of the investigation. What she gets involved in though is much darker and scarier then what she actually thought was real. People who enjoy books about people getting past illusions, and finding about he truth will enjoy this book."
1614,Marcela,"3.5 StarsThe Girl on the Train was a good read for the most part. I was quickly hooked with the plot and how the story is told from the perspective of three characters, Rachel, Megan, and Anna. The only thing is, none of the three narrators can be trusted. I thought that was very clever from Paula Hawkins. Reading this book I wanted to root for Rachel -the girl on the train- but as an alcoholic she just kept making bad choice after bad choice and that's how the whole story becomes a tangled up mess. This type of mystery plot made me think of Gone Girl and Dark Places. In fact, I became excited thinking it was going to be that type of book with several ""twists in the plot"" and guessing the ""who did it?"" However, that was my problem with this book and the fact that I figured it out a bit soon. I kept hoping to be wrong and have another twist in the story, but I was right and that made the story feel a bit flat at the end. Overall, I think it was a good, entertaining book."
1615,Trian Lesmana,"Seru. Novel ini membuat pembaca menebak-menebak. Paula Hawkins pandai memainkan skenario dan alur yang bikin greget. Semakin tipis sisa halaman yang belum terbaca, makin menarik. Dibutuhkan konsentrasi membaca yang lebih untuk novel ini karena harus memperhatikan setting waktu dalam cerita. "
1616,Simran Mehta,A riveting masterpiece that has been carefully plotted and written with all the right details to keep you from putting the book down till the very end. One of the best thrillers I've read. 
1617,Al,"I wish I hadn't guessed whodunnit less than a quarter of the way through--or rather, that my guess hadn't been validated, but oh, what a wonderful cast of entirely unlikeable, messed up, falling apart, disastrous characters nonetheless. And what a wonderful plot of jerked-around suspicions and pieced-together interactions. My only complaints regard a few issues surrounding the ending, but the rest is so good, so much fun, that it's more than worth picking up--and then being unable to put down."
1618,Leandra,"This book was a good thriller to read. I have to admit, I was looking all over for clues and I still missed them. I didn't figure out who was the culprit till nearly the end.Rachel was an EXTEMELY hard character to warm too. She was depressing but I am glad the author gradually unfolded her past to show where she came from. I wish we had more in depth review of Tom but still what a fun book to read.I highly recommend for lazy rainy afternoons in fall and maybe some summer reading."
1619,Cherie,"Good, well paced mystery. In the genre of Gone Girl in that there aren't many likable characters but you don't mind because the story is moving along. I enjoyed reading this but I like a good mystery. All of the characters are flawed, but I'm more than o.k. with that! It's a fast read, enjoy!"
1620,Sanah,"I won't tell you what the book was about, but I will tell you how it makes you feel. No spoilers here. My Review -How do you trust the story of an unemployed, forgetful, obsessed alcoholic? You don't. You stare at her, judge her and then walk away. A New York Times Bestseller, The Girl on the Train is nothing short of a breathtaking journey into the human mind, it's snap judgements, and people in general. The story revolves around Rachel- a jobless, divorced, alcoholic living with a roommate. The story involves Rachel, Megan, Anna and Tom. The other characters, as vital as the aforementioned, just flow in and out of the story - in perfect rhythm of a pro knitter. Rachel takes the same train to work every day. She obsesses over the same houses every day. She dreams up a life for the tenants of that house. She imagines what their life would be like. She knows that it's just her imagination but her imagination is the only thing nowadays that keeps her going. Then one day, something changes. Something is off. She knows it, she reports it and she tries to face it. Before she knows it, her memories are failing her and her heart is swaying her. She is caught between her imagination, her reality and her memory. She confronts them, despite her better judgement and for the first time, her imagination and her reality collide in a way she never saw coming. Her present emotions and past actions make for a saucy story and a terrible life. The characters are relatable and despicable at once. Hawkins has boldly merged the lined between good and bad and dances carefully on the little chasm in between. The reader is never fully sure of what to think or how to feel. Hawkins keeps you wondering, hoping and yet double guessing yourself.  The Girl on the Train is a fast paced, well written, beautifully developed book. It leaves you with an uneasy happiness and a relaxed sigh. Throughout the book, you are evoked and provoked and yet calmed. The characters are real - they are ugly, they are mean and yet, they are beautiful.The portrayal of the human mind and desire is so raw, it leaves you struggling to find peace except till the very end.

1621,Jewelianne,"So I didn't quite drink the kool-aid on this one. I thought it was a good book. I wanted to know what happened, and unlike many of you I did NOT guess who the villain was right away. (I'm sorry, Camille. I could have seen it going in different ways. I guess I'm not as smart as you are. ;) ) I also enjoyed that I didn't really like the characters for a lot of the book. Rachel! Get yourself together, girl! It felt sort of realistic. I mean, would you like Rachel in real life? Even if you were close to her, she would probably drive you insane. But I have to admit I don't quite understand the huge amount of hype. "
1622,Tiff Hill,"I generally stick to YA, but I was pleasantly surprised with this one! I wasn't sure at first if I would like it switching between the different perspectives, but in the end I actually really enjoyed it! If one got too long, or dull it was ok because another perspective would pop up in a second. I would definitely recommend this book! Oh, and this was the first time in a while I didn't see the plot twist coming. I totally thought it was one person throughout the entire book until right about the time they said it was another! Awesome! "
1623,Kristi Vitale,"Moments on a moving train. You're sitting quietly, anonymously. Life out the window flashes by in an instant, in segments -- scenery, sunlight, shadow, flash, flash, changing fast, continuous movement, continuous change, with heavy clicks of wheels on track. This is what I feel, what I see when I read The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins. In those moments you witness time and life at 50 mph. Going too fast to know if there's more behind the glimpse. Your perception influenced by what you want to envision, what you like seeing outside. But you witness something bad in a quick out your window. Then you think you know something even worse. Now you're able to step off the train and delve deep into the mystery. Reality may be a whole different story. Your keen perception, off. You think you know. But now you don't. Maybe it's best to remain anonymous.. No way. You're too far gone. Now that you're either entirely intrigued, or slightly confused, read this fun thriller. It's really, really good. And it's been a long time since I've read a book I couldn't put down. We all loved it - 4 out of 5 stars from each one of the Mindful Readers"
1624,Jim,"Like a creepy, paranoid and atmospheric Hitchcock thriller leached onto the written page (elements of Rear Window come to mind). Deeply flawed characters struggling to carry on in an environment where troubled pasts, chronic lies and bad choices predominate, everything is uncertain and nothing is quite what it seems. Do you think you know, or can imagine, how other people live their lives? Ms. Hawkins' view of the world suggests quite the opposite...that we can really never know what is percolating behind our neighbors' closed doors or under their skins. And based on these characters we probably don't want to know. Her story is more than a routine mystery who-done-it: it is interesting, psychologically nuanced, well-plotted and a compelling read."
1625,Sassiie,"2am, way too late to start a book. So I thought I'll just read the first fifty pages. So I thought 4am, let me just finish this chapter. So I thought Oh 7am---time to walk my dog already?8am---I can finally sleep. After I write this review, of course. HahahaThis was such a quick action packed read. Loved it. Though I have to agree with some people who say, the ending fell a bit short. The rest of the story was great so I'll let it slide. The author had me guessing like crazy. I kept switching culprits. It was even better than the main narrator was so unreliable, made me think a bit harder. Can't say the reveal was as shocking as I would've like, but my heart was racing so, that's a good sign as any in my book."
1626,Junemarie Brandt,"The format was a little contrived, but overall compelling narrative. Several unrealistic plot turns, and you just wanted to sold each of the three narrators to shape up emotionally, they were all damaged and self destructive."
1627,Betsy,"good story, although it dragged in parts. So many unlike able characters, you think any one of then could have ""done it."" Some parts are still kind of vague to me, though...It's one of those books that you have to work at reading. but, I liked it."
1628, Jenny ➳,"Finished this in one sitting.Extremely captivating, thrilling and suspenseful.These characters that are introduced to the readers are fleshed out, exposing every emotion and deceit that a human can be capable of.A recommend for lovers of suspense, and thrillers set within a marriage type setting. I absolutely loved the motif of the trains - added to the perfectness of it. "
1629,Natalie Brignac,"Wow! This book takes you through the screwed up lives of the main characters, while allowing you to be sympathetic to their situations they have placed themselves in. I loved it and love the ending I truly did not see coming!"
1630,Sabine,"Vorweg vielleicht eins – das Buch wird oft als Thriller oder Krimi gehandelt; das ist es aus meiner Sicht nicht. Es ist ein toller Roman, der vor allem durch die (zugegebenermaßen kaputten und leider auch unsympathischen) Charaktere glänzt und der eher ein Psychodrama oder eine Charakterstudie darstellt. Und liest man das Buch aus dieser Sicht, finde ich es richtig gelungen.Das Buch ist aus Sicht dreier verschiedener Frauen geschrieben, die jeweils als Ich-Erzählerin auftreten und ihre Sicht verschiedener Dinge schildern. Zunächst fand ich das verwirrend, doch nach und nach wird klar, wie die verschiedenen Personen miteinander verbunden sind. Jedem Kapitel ist aber vorangestellt, aus wessen Sicht gerade geschildert wird, so dass eigentlich keine Verwechslungen auftreten können, zumal auch die Erzählweisen der drei Frauen ganz unterschiedlich war. Schwierig fand ich nur die Zeitsprünge – während Rachel und Anna immer ihre Eindrücke aus aktueller Sicht schildern, liegen das, was Megan zu sagen hat, in der Vergangenheit, ein paar Monate vor den aktuellen Ereignissen.Der Einstieg in die Geschichte ist zugegebenermaßen gemächlich und richtig spannend wird es erst nach ca. 100 Seiten. Dennoch aber hat mir auch der Anfang gefallen, weil er Möglichkeit gibt, Rachel kennenzulernen und sich auf sie einzulassen. Sie ist mir zwar nicht sympathisch, dennoch aber fand ich ihre Gedanken und Gefühle interessant und ihren Charakter einfach wunderbar ausgearbeitet. Sie treibt durchs Leben, gibt sich dem Alkohol hin, warum, erfährt man im Lauf der Geschichte, und scheitert immer wieder an der Aufgabe, endlich die Finger von ihm zu lassen. Auch ihr Handeln wird deutlich vom Alkohol bestimmt, und so konnte ich vieles einfach nicht nachvollziehen. Trotzdem aber habe ich ihre Abschnitte immer gerne gelesen, ihre Verzweiflung gespürt und letztlich auch ihren – wenn auch versteckten - Lebenswillen. Auch die anderen Charaktere sind sehr gut gezeichnet, wobei es neben den beiden anderen erzählenden Frauen Megan und Anna auch noch deren Ehemänner und eine Mitbewohnerin von Rachel gibt. Sympathisch ist mir keiner der Figuren, aber sie sind sehr lebensnah und echt, sie wirken mit ihren Problemen authentisch, und alle kann ich mir so oder ähnlich tatsächlich auch vorstellen.Toll fand ich vor allem, dass die Geschichte gar nicht mehr Personen braucht, um trotzdem zu fesseln. Es ist eher eine subtile, untergründige Spannung, die mich gepackt hat und mich das Buch hat in kurzer Zeit verschlingen lassen, und auch wenn das Ende vielleicht vorhersehbar war, fand ich es doch schlüssig und glaubhaft. An der einen oder anderen Stelle war mir die Geschichte etwas zu lang gezogen, denn Rachels Gedanken wiederholen sich, dadurch aber wird ihre Not noch mal deutlicher und trotz dieser Längen hatte die Geschichte auf mich eine Sogwirkung. Vielleicht aber auch, weil mich der Schreibstil total überzeugt hat – ich fand ihn nicht nur angenehm zu lesen, sondern sehr eindringlich und den Punkt genau treffend. Er hat eine düstere Atmosphäre geschaffen und die verzweifelte Grundstimmung aller Beteiligten wunderbar transportiert – kurz gesagt: mich hat er gefangen genommen und richtig in die Geschichte gezogen.Mein FazitWer einen Thriller oder einen Krimi erwartet, der wird wahrscheinlich enttäuscht sein von dieser Geschichte, denn der Roman gleicht eher einem Psychodrama oder einer Charakterstudie. Und als solches ist er wirklich gelungen. Die Charaktere sind fantastisch gestaltet, sehr authentisch und glaubhaft, die Geschichte ist eher untergründig spannend und der Schreibstil durch seine Eindringlichkeit sehr fesselnd. Mir hat das Buch sehr gut gefallen – einen Stern ziehe ich nur ab, da es durch einige Gedankenwiederholungen doch zu wenigen Längen gekommen ist. Trotzdem hat mich „Girl on the train“ sehr gut unterhalten und verdient von mir 4/5 Sternen. "
1631,Simon Taylor,"The Girl on the Train is a tense thriller about a missing woman, told by multiple narrators in a non-linear arrangement. It might sound like Gone Girl, and has been heavily compared to it, but the comparison does both a disservice.The most prominent narrator is Rachel Watson, an infertile alcoholic who has been divorced and fired and is staying with a university friend while pretending to put her life back together. She is the titular girl on the train, and while pretending to go to work each day she looks longingly at the street she used to live in, fantasting about a perfect couple she often sees. The other narrators are Anna, her husband’s new wife who lives in the same house as they used to, and Megan, one half of Rachel’s perfect girl and the one who goes missing.Megan’s disappearance draws Rachel into their lives, having observed them from the train for some time. She believes she has information that might help. Soon, the three households become rapidly entwined in each other’s dramas.None of the characters are immediately likeable, but it’s hard not to feel sorry for Rachel. She may be her own worst enemy, but it wouldn’t do her any harm to catch a break. Hawkins does well to maintain such a tight cast, keeping a very small core of characters central to all of the action. They all have backstories, all have secrets and are all very carefully devised, though none of them have any particularly distinct personality.There are some surprises in store along the way, though the pace is sluggish in parts and the ending isn’t particularly difficult to predict. The Girl on the Train instead provides some compelling character drama; this is a real study in how people affect each other, the impact that one life has on another, and how each person is the sum of their history. It traces the butterfly effect of relationships and lies.There may be some delays, but The Girl on the Train is well worth the ride."
1632,Rebecca Kim,"Thrillers aren't my favorite, but this one was super well-done. Even though the main character frustrated me for a long time, I still couldn't put it down! It all paid off in the end, loved the final twists!"
1633,The Story Center,"I listened to “The Girl on the Train,” by Paula Hawkins as I have been repeatedly told to give it a try. Set in the London suburban outskirts, and propelled through the story by way of a commuter train, this psychological thriller jumps forwards and backwards, interspersing points-of view. Three women tell one story – a whodunit. Rachel is the broken woman on the train who is forced to roll by her old life every day. She's an alcoholic and still obsessing on her ex-husband.Anna is the young wife and mother who stole herself a husband, and now misses her days as a mistress. Megan is the seemingly perfect wife on the balcony with the carefree appearance and the handsome husband, but she hides secrets and yearns to run away. It was a fresh story (quite a feat in the age of ""Gone Girl"") with remarkable pacing and tension, but also an amazing audiobook with fantastic narrators.I highly recommend the story, and will add - listen to it if you can.As far as debut authors go, Paula Hawkins is one to watch."
1634,Robert Miller,"This is the first book of fiction I have read in 20 years; I am told that reading only nonfiction makes a person less interesting, so not wanting to risk it, I picked this book up. The author tells the story through the words of three narrators, Rachel, Megan and Anna. Rachel is a scorned, hard-drinking, unemployed woman who displaces her pain over the loss of her husband (Tom) to another woman (Anna), by regularly riding a train to and from her rented suburban apartment to London; she gives anyone who knows her the impression that she is going to work each day even though she was fired because of her excessive drinking. She fantasizes over a particular house on the route and makes up names for the occupants she perceives to be leading the ideal life as husband and wife- a life she used to have. One day, she sees a man at this house, embracing the women who isn't her husband. Later, she finds out the woman (her real name is Megan) turns up missing and her real husband (Scott) becomes a suspect. Her ex lives next door (not a fantasy) with Anna. The crux of the mystery turns on Rachel's ability to recall details in spite of her alcohol-induced stupors, her lack of credibility, and about four suspects- all who had the motive and opportunity to kill Megan. There are ample trysts, sexual scenes, and twists in the book making it exciting. I recommend this book. "
1635,JP,"The main character, Rachel Watson, is so pathetic and unlikable that sometimes you feel disencouraged to keep reading, and give up on the story. That would be a big mistake. Once you get into reading it’s hard to stop.Rachel is the girl on the train, passenger on a daily, one-hour train into London from its suburbs. On the way, the train often stops for several minutes near Rachel’s old house, where she lived for a period of time and happily with her then husband Tom. From her train window, she looks into the backyards, houses and windows of her former neighborhood.From the train window, she sees the lives of middle-class families, and it’s a daily reminder of her own let downs: She’s in her 30s, divorced, childless, lonely and arguably an alcoholic. She has not a soul she is close to. She just lives. Her self-destructive life revolves around sadness and jealousy, especially of her ex-husband’s new life. She suffers from drunken blackouts and moments of weakness that leave her confused and feeling guilty, though she’s not sure of what."
1636,Mer,"Not going to lie to you, I gasped and screamed out loud at sections. Very entertaining. You don't need to be on a train whilst reading, but there were times when I was on a train and it gave it a lil' somethin' somethin' extra."
1637,Calvin,"A real page turner, kept me guessing for the guts of two days till I'd finished."
1638,James Koppert,my friend leant me this one for my holiday and I couldn't put it down. cleverly written and cleverly designed in its delivery.
1639,Sheryl,"A really good compelling story with some really unlikable characters. Rachel was a divorced alcoholic woman who takes the train from the suburbs to downtown London and stares out the window and imagines the life of the people that live in the houses along the tracks. She envisions the life of one particular home and is devastated that the wife in this house is having an affair. And did I mention that her ex-husband and his new wife and child live a few doors down also along the tracks. When the wife disappears, Rachel becomes involved. The book is told from 3 narrator perspectives, Rachel, the main character, Megan, the wife who disappears, and Ana, the new wife of Tom (Rachel's ex and Megan's neighbor). "
1640,Jaime,"I won this in a Goodreads giveaway.Rachel: The ex-wife, still trying to get over Tom. She's an alcoholic whose life is in shambles. I don't like her because of her lies, especially when she tells her roommate Cathy that she's trying to get better and going to AA. She rides the train into London every day, passing behind her old house in the process.Anna: The current wife, with some paranoid issues. I don't like her because she never cared she was a homewrecker, didn't care when she broke up Rachel and Tom's marriage (especially with her pregnancy), and will immediately jump to assumptions when she's told something bad about someone.Megan: A woman Rachel sees from the train, who lives with her husband Scott just a few doors down from where Rachel used to live (and where Tom & Anna currently are). I don't like her because she's a cheater and a liar, but her background shows that she has some psychological issues. I don't sympathize, especially when she takes advantage of help she receives.The story focuses around the three women's points of views and how their lives end up entwined.I don't like Scott because he's emotionally abusive by constantly checking in on Anna and being distrustful.I don't like Tom because he's a cheat and a liar and a sneak.I don't like the psychologist Abdic because he gets with his client and seems to be a creep.Basically, all of the characters irritated me and yet I did not want to stop reading. I didn't want to work so I could finish the book. I don't know what to give it. It was great and kept everyone guessing and the characters encountered new people and situations. But I really couldn't tolerate the characters. (view spoiler)[Except Abdic, because everyone makes mistakes and his he stopped (hide spoiler)]. Maybe Rachel, in the end."
1641,Michele Christensen,"I enjoyed this book. It kept my attention and was fast-paced. I thought the characters were all very interesting and intriguing. Unlike many people I did not think all of the characters were horrible people. I did not care for Tom, Anna, or Scott but Rachel and Megan had some very real flaws and insights into being a human being. Where they are hot mess? Yes. Are many people hot messes? Yes. It's part of being human. We got a view into what they were thinking -- they didn't always act on it -- although often they did. But their thoughts were very real.I would recommend. "
1642,Candi,"I really enjoyed this book, but I can't say I LOVED it because the characters are so absolutely unlikeable. All of them. There's not a single character I could stand. Rachel especially drives me insane. The whinging and crying and self loathing is just grating. Add the poor decisions and complete lack of self control and you spend half the book wanting the murderer to kill HER. Ha. That said, it was a great whodunnit with lots of twists and turns. I can see the comparisons to Gone Girl. Read and enjoyed that one too, and had equal disdain for those characters. "
1643,Charlotte,"I wasn't going to post a review until I saw not only the number of one-star reviews, but also snarks about how this is only something people who don't read like. Er, no. I read LOTS. I also read enough to be able to differentiate between something I dislike and something 'badly written'. It's not that either.It's not without its flaws. I think more description would have enriched it. The few descriptive passages there are (mostly skies) show she can write them well enough. It's possible that she didn't want to pull 'the camera' back - reading the book was like watching a film where all the shots are up close and intimate.However, considering how I normally avoid first person present, especially FPP from multiple POVs, I read it in one sitting. And after reading the one star reviews, I gave more thought to the book's appeal.The difference, I think, is the degree of self-awareness the writer & characters have about how nuts they are. In many novels (that I put down early on) the main character is often just as crazy, but the author presents their terrible behavior as normal and perfectly acceptable. In those, you're supposed to believe/accept that the MC rages on people, is incredibly self-centered or mentally unstable, but it's all good, she's normal and the characters in her world love her regardless. They're like those relatives you always want to escape from but they make you feel like you're the one who's mad. Normally those characters are Anna, only you're expected to root for them.Here, the author knows her main characters are messed-up, the characters' behaviour is appalling, what they do isn't okay. Nor is it considered acceptable by other characters. Yet they are still relatable and even sympathetic. She crawled right up inside their heads to show their world as they experience it.The book isn't perfect, I can see why people dislike it, but it isn't a one-star book."
1644,Sloane Mayberry,You get what you sign up for with this one….
1645,Tamara Vallejos,"The first half read so much like a ""Gone Girl"" copycat that I was a teensy bit annoyed. A couple that looks perfect on the outside but may have secrets no one knows, a missing wife, a husband acting oddly and suspected for her disappearance. And all told through alternating chapters told from two different viewpoints. Except that one viewpoint is the missing wife, and one is just a commuter on a train who saw more than she was supposed to and happened to get involved. So in that last detail it diverged from ""Gone Girl."" And then I hit a point when a third person's narrative entered the book. And from then things starting getting interesting, and the plot went off the rails (in a good way, and pun intended). I found myself hurrying through the second half because I was dying to find out whodunnit. And when the big reveal began, I was actually really nervous and excited and a little scared. So I'm pretty pleased with how this book ultimately took on a life of its own. Definitely thrilling."
1646,Anita Fajita Pita,"Oh wow, what a crazy ride. This book was good at keeping me glued to the pages. Paula Hawkins is a master storyteller. She unfolds it carefully, slowly revealing pieces of the characters in her telling. Really, it was quite an entertaining read. I moved through such a range of emotions, theories, understandings... always wanting to turn the page to see what comes next? What will happen now? All of the characters are complex beings, and we are given a view of their lives just so.Addictive. Hooked to the very end, Hawkins is such a manipulator! Not even my usual read, but I highly recommend."
1647,Leslie Jem,"I did not enjoy reading this book, and yet I found it extremely compelling. The author has clearly mastered the use of unreliable narrators. I also appreciated the decidedly unglamorous portrayal of alcoholism. Finally, the ending was tidy and satisfying, and not a drawn-out hot mess (unlike Gone Girl, to which it is frequently compared)."
1648,La-Lionne,"I get it why this book is NYT bestseller. The story flows nicely and, for the most part, it reads like a really good movie script. The first 40% of the story was slow, but didn't drag. If it makes sense. Not a lot happened, aside from endless train trips back and forward and tons of foggy drunken episodes, which at the time felt insignificant, but were later explained very well. I thought that the author used a lot of space to set the tone and introduce all the characters. Too much for my personal liking, but as I said, it wasn't boring. The reason I'm taking away one star is because of one character, who was added for a sole reason to throw a reader of tracks and nothing else. The person kept being mentioned and I was sure that he will play a significant role, but he didn't. The truth was revealed and I thought ""What was the point of having him in the story at all?""The book was great. I would recommend to anyone who enjoys a well written psychological thriller. "
1649,Annette Chidzey,"This novel was intriguing at the beginning, though a little confusing until the characters were more readily defined. It was compelling after a few chapters and the changing narrative told by Rachel, Anna and Megan was enthralling. It certainly was a page turner and the varied viewpoints meant the narration was always interesting. I found myself reading large sections without even realising."
1650,Catherine McGinnes,"Really enjoyed this book! Great mystery and fascinating characters. Hawkins wrote a main character that I couldn't help but root for even as she was basically destroying her own life. Also genuinely scary at some parts. My heart was racing. It had a good, realistic resolution and tied everything up nicely in the end. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes mysteries that are character-driven and less procedural. "
1651,J21mckinney,Glad that's over. I'm exhausted!
1652,Rory Flynn,"I really enjoyed the book. Characters were true to life and Rachel's anguish with her drinking problem resonated with me (recovering alcoholic w/ 25+ years of sobriety). The ""twist"" at the end is not so much startling as it is sudden. But, the Rashomon style story-telling lent a lot to overall suspense and anxiety. Comparisons to Gone Girl are unfair to both authors and to potential readers. This stands on its own and does not any lazy marketing/comparisons."
1653,Beth Lobdell,"Creepy, eerie, and suspenseful. Bet this would make a good movie. Very entertaining."
1654,Daniela Medina,"What an exciting read! I had been wanting to find an exhilarating thriller like this one for months, and I enjoyed the huge amounts of drama and suspense in it greatly. The only reason why I rate it with four stars instead of five is because the ending didn't take me by surprise at all: I kind of knew the whole time what was about to happen. Leaving that aside, I still think this is a great book for thriller fans: a story where there are no innocent lambs or pitiful victims, where everybody has something to hide and the reader has to decide who to trust more: an alcoholic, a compulsive cheat, or an expert liar? Looking forward to reading more by Paula Hawkings!"
1655,Darklady,Uma trama que prende do princípio ao fim mas a meu ver com um final que podia ser melhor.
1656,Jess Porringa-Dinan,I enjoyed this story being told from multiple perspectives. It's lack of overt plot twists kept you guessing and showcased how things are not always as they appear in the lives of those we observe around us. Good and fast read!
1657,Helen Stanton,Not a massive reader or fan of thrillers but I felt this one really worked . Maybe it's because I'm a commuter but the starting point of lives glimpsed everyday had me gripped ...lots of twists and turns. Not a challenging read but a very enjoyable one .
1658,Akylina,"Καλογραμμένο, γρήγορο και ανατρεπτικό, με πλοκή που σου κόβει την ανάσα και σε κάνει να θες να το καταβροχθίσεις μονομιάς. "
1659,Dead John Williams,I really liked it and could see what all the hype was about. Beyond that I don't have much to say about it
1660,Leyla,"This shit is so good. Fans of Gillian Flynn will like the fast paced nature of this book. A real page turner that hooks you in right from the start. Thrilling and mysterious, the Rachel's unreliable narration keeps the reader guessing all the way through until the very last page."
1661,Azka,I have been pleasantly surprised because i did not see this happening!
1662,Samhita,"I did kinda like the book - its in the same category as Gone Girl, but it's not as well plotted. The authors attempts at misdirection earlier on seem very clumsy. I never bought the first suspect as the actual killer - so I really thought that he/she was going to BE the actual killer which would have been a surprise. But alas, no such luck. That said, I had scenarios in my head where at least two people could have been the killer so I was still kept guessing till the reveal. As a people watcher myself I did enjoy the first bit where Rachel is speculating about Megan's perfect life - very relatable. "
1663,Jan Schindler,"really good, fast read, kept me guessing. This is one of those books where I don't really like any of the characters, yet, I couldn't put the book down. All the characters have flaws. This, to me, makes them ring true as human beings. Recommend"
1664,Nilesh,"A brilliantly crafted mysteryTwo increasingly common features of our age novels are chronological jangling of the narration and a story told through the mingling of perspectives of multiple characters. The author's use of these tricks is not new but unlikely in many other books, these tools are not used to exhibit the creator's smartness. Rather they truly add to the charm of the story without appearing artificial.The fast paced book seems to start extremely simplistically. The author seamlessly infuses ever higher levels of complexity through straightforward events. To a degree, the mystery itself is not that masterful, but its bundling and then unraveling are. Readers are barely acquainted with the unusual setup and the big event sneaks up from nowhere. All the characters are ""designed"" credibly normal as well as adequately quirky. The same is true about interactions that are short, relevant and that help in pushing the story ahead all the time.The climax is stretched by the standards set by the rest of the novel. However, it does not take away a great debut novel."
1665,Alan,"Man was this a quick read. It was fresh, different (not Gone Girl II, no way),it was unique, and the words flowed nicely. I was a little disappointed that I saw the ending coming and that it was revealed, both a few pages too soon, but not too disappointed. Hawkins developed strong characters, none of them likable!"
1666,Mandi Schreiner,"Did this on in audio and the three narrators are fantastic. Megan, Rachel and Anna each get their own narrator and they portrayed each woman so well. Their voices for the men were done well too. They truly enhanced my reading experience.Engaging story as well. Depressing, but intriguing. I really liked it."
1667,Olivia,Enjoyed this! 3.5-4 stars. Definitely a page-turner. Some very spooky imagery. And I thought author handled the unreliable narrator theme deftly. Book club tomorrow night :)
1668,Denise Freeman,"4.5 stars. Yep, you guys should read this. I felt a little anxious reading this as it is a psychological thriller. Felt a little like Gone Girl in its weirdness."
1669,Kristie,"Really enjoyed this one! I almost didn't read it because of the comparison to Gone Girl. I'm not typically a fan of stories with unreliable narrators and I thought Gone Girl was ok, but not worth the hype at all. I think this story is better. I didn't feel like I had been lied to for the whole story. In my opinion, the comparison to Gone Girl does this novel a disservice. It is a good book on its own. Without giving much away, the main narrator is an alcoholic. You are told this at the beginning of the book, so no, it is not really a spoiler. I was frustrated with her throughout much of the book. She makes terrible choices, even when she is sober. I wanted to reach into the book at times and snap her out of it and shout at her. It was frustrating! There are two other narrators in the book, both are very flawed women that I could not really relate to, but I enjoyed hearing their perspectives. They rounded out the story well, but were not likable. To be honest, there wasn't a character in the book that I'd want to hang out with.The ending....yes, you most likely know who-done-it before the end, but it was still good. More bad decisions ensue, but you wonder how many options the main character had at that point. I liked the way the very end was done, where they tie up the loose ends. It wasn't a neat little bow, but felt a bit more realistic. So, I don't generally care for stories with unlikable characters or unreliable narrators. I was frustrated with the decisions that the characters made and I knew who-done-it before the end. Yet, this story was interesting enough that I could overlook those things and still enjoy the book. At the end of the book, I was left with the ""what a good book"" feeling and that's what I'm rating this book on. I would definitely recommend this book to people that are considering it. Be prepared to be frustrated and enjoy it. "
1670,Keely,"I actually read this in just over one day. Pleasantly surprised that Paula Hawkins kept me guessing right up until the end (even my husband remarked on the fact that I hadn't sussed it all out well before the end). Damaged characters galore and convoluted lives that are tangled and crisscross every which way. I found myself feeling a certain way towards various characters only to have those feelings change dramatically as the book moved along. Great sense of forward motion that made putting the book down difficult. I kept telling myself I would read just one more chapter and put the book down. Clearly, I did a lot more reading than putting down. If you're looking for a quick moving engaging suspenseful mystery of tangled human lives - this book is the one to pick up."
1671,Anmiryam,"The Girl on the Train is a page turner of a thriller that mostly earns the advance buzz that surrounds it. What makes the book work is Hawkins' choice to build the narrative around Rachel Watson. As a narrator Rachel is simultaneously repulsive -- a divorced, unemployed alcoholic who even she knows is hell to live with -- and sympathetic. To fill her days, and hide her lack of a job from her flatmate, she travels to and from her home to London on a train that passes the back garden of the house she shared with her ex-husband. She fill her nights with drinking to the point of blacking out and drunk dialing or emailing her former spouse, enraging him and scaring his new wife.On her train trips Rachel concocts idealized fantasies about a couple living several doors aways from her former house. Her obsession leads her to meddle when the young woman goes missing, just days after Rachel spied her kissing a man not her husband. Her pursuit of the truth is neither graceful, nor gracefully received. Her drinking is persistent, even though she knows it's self-destructive, dangerous and earns her the contempt of nearly everyone she encounters.Hawkins cleverly intersperses Rachels tragic perspective with that of Megan, the young wife who has vanished, and that of Anna, her former husband's new wife. As a chorus these three women each have a part to play. Even with the richness that comes from these other voices, it's Rachel's story and character that are central. The novel's propulsive momentum comes not from who is the culprit -- I sussed that out quickly and I'm sure many others will as well -- but in the inept, and very nearly tragic amateur detecting that Rachel engages in, even as her newfound quest provides a glimmer of hope that she might be stronger than the demons that plague her. The suspense is whether or not she will learn the truth about herself before she is destroyed by drink or violence. An excellent character driven read for a cold winter night."
1672,Dipanshi,"The Girl On The Train was the first of this genre I have ever read. It wasn't the sort of stuff I usually read - generally my to-read list is filled with fantasies and kiddish adventure novels. But this. It was in every sense of the word a THRILLER, it had me guessing and second guessing every thing. We have three narrators - Rachel, Megan and Anna. They are so messed up - a drunk, a liar and a cheat. These women are so immoral and they do such stuff that if you hear about it, you would despise each and every one of them. But since the novel is in first person, I couldn't help but pity the three. After reading a couple of pages after the main incident, I was like ""This is SO obvious. There is no mystery at all."" But I continued to read on since the writing was wonderful and I wanted to be able to say ""I so saw this coming"" in a smug way. But later I get on and find that I am thinking, ""Maybe, it could be this person too...?"" and then I came to the end. And it turned out that I was wrong after all. I imagined every person to the culprit - except the culprit. Hawkins' writing was epic. She would give you clues about the totally wrong thing and you would believe it. Believe me, you should check this out if you want a breathless, fast paced, dangerous ride.PS: Please check out Emily May's review for making up your mind. It was the one that convinced me to read it. Its much more better written than mine and sums up my feelings (and hers, of course) perfectly."
1673,Pattie,"The Girl on the Train is the debut(!) novel by Paula Hawkins. It is a fun, mostly exciting, and very fast read. It is not, however, and should not be compared to ""Gone Girl."" They are two completely different styles and moods and, at this stage, levels of intricacies in writing. The strange thing about this book is that although the main character is sad and drunk and a wholly unreliable narrator, the book has an almost breezy quality to it, as if you are on the train yourself whisking right along.To give a (very) quick summary, the book is about Rachel, a lonely divorced drunk of a woman who has lost her job but still rides the commuter train as if to work each day. Each day she passes her old house where her husband and mistress (now new wife) live with their new baby and has difficulty coping. 3 houses down from where she used to live she occasionally sees another couple -- she names them Jess and Jason -- and through brief glimpses from the train as it rushes by makes up a love story for their lives. Then one day she sees the wife (Jess) appearing to kiss another man. Soon after, Jess disappears and Rachel insinuates herself into the investigation. But, she is an unreliable witness for she was drunk at the time and apparently had gotten off the train and been in the neighborhood at the time of the disappearance. Only problem is, Rachel has blackouts and cannot remember any details of the evening....The chapters are from the point of view of three different women: (1) Rachel, (2) her ex-husband's new wife, Anna, and (3) the woman who disappeared. Through it all the, train rockets past the houses and Rachel struggles mightily with the idea of sobriety and the life she has lost. I don't want to give much away about the personalities of the other women and their struggles, but it adds some interest and another layer to the book.Somewhere around page 150-200 I figured out the twist, but I was still having a great time. It did bog down about two-thirds of the way through, but it picked back up and had an above-average, but not great, ending. There was, I believe, a bit of trying to do too much intertwining of all characters introduced -- you know -- the kitchen sink approach, but it was still a strong debut.I really am a solid 3.5 stars on this book but since that rating is not allowed I bumped it to 4 for the inventive premise, the quick pace, the character of Rachel and the changing narrations. Some tighter editing and not trying to be too much with what she had could have made it great. Still, she is an author to watch. "

1675,Joana Gomes,"Tive que ficar acordada ontem até acabar o livro para saber o que afinal tinha acontecido à Megan. A história vai-se desenrolando até de forma bastante rápida e a partir de uma certa altura... eu só queria chegar ao fim! LOL Já não lia um livro assim viciante há muito tempo!Dou-lhe 4 estrelas porque o recomendaria a alguém que goste de policiais, não o deixaria na prateleira a apanhar pó. As personagens são todas intragáveis (não simpatizei com nenhuma) mas não vazias. Ler a história do ponto de vista de uma mulher alcoólica que não consegue parar de beber é frustrante, apetece bater-lhe! Mas é uma boa perspectiva, diferente pelo menos, ajudou-me a ter (mais) consciência sobre os vícios..."
1676,Katherine Coble,"This is one of those reviews where I admit that pretty much all four of the stars I gave are for the writing and construction of the book. There are books like _Blood Song_ and _Pepper In The Gumbo_ and _Name Of The Wind_ and Harry Potter where you just plain like at least one of the characters. You root for them and are propelled through the story out of affection and hope. Then there are books like this. Everybody in this story is a deeply broken person. The more you read the more festering rot you find. I don't think there are going to be lots of little Rachels in kindergartens five years from now, because unlike Bella or Harry, Rachel is not a protagonist you treasure. But Hawkins gets full points for doing the unreliable narrator WELL. Unlike other books (_Gone Girl_, Im looking at you) this unreliable narrator is earnest and direct. For me the difference is between _withheld details_ and _deliberately wrong details_. You can have a book where you simply say ""I'm a middle aged woman reading"" and then the surprise in store for the reader comes with the building reveal that the initial assumptions were incorrect. The reader will assume things based on that information and you can wallop them later with ""I died when I was 42 and im reading my tombstone"" or whatever. That's a well-done unreliable narration. That's how this book is. The other type--where the author outright lies--is the type I dislike so much. That's unfortunately the type which is so popular now. In those the author says ""I'm a middle aged woman reading"" and then halfway through says ""ha! Just kidding. I'm an illiterate man."" That is NOT how this book is. The mere fact that Hawkins plays clever but not cheap with her audience elevates this book well above others it's compared to. "
1677,Shari (colourmeread),"Ok, not gonna lie, it took me a while to get into this book. I think it was because of the writing style and getting used to the pace of the story. The Girl on the Train is my first thriller, so I don't have anything else to compare it to, but I will say I had a good reading experience and here's why:1. The characters, especially Rachel, were so flawed and human that you can't help but want to find out what happens to them in the story. I got annoyed by some of them multiple times because despite good intentions, they always end up making poor decisions that make things worse. Did I have many pull-my-hair-why-do-I-read-this moments? Yes. Was it worth it? Yes. It was worth it because it was so realistic that despite my frustrations with the characters, I question whether I would have fared much better. And that was scary.2. The Girl on the Train is so intriguing because it messes with your mind. You can't trust the characters and this was something new to me. It's not that they blatantly lie, it's that their perception of the truth is questionable and their perceptions of each other is also distorted. Overall, I strongly recommend this book to anyone looking for a psychological thriller with unreliable characters who will keep you guessing!"
1678,Marta,"I have heard this book be compare to ""Gone Girl"" over and over and that is part of what got me to pick up this novel (as I really enjoyed ""Gone Girl""). From the onset I was awaiting this mind-blowing plot twist, with each turn of the page I was trying to think outside of the box for what is to come and I think I sort of ruined this novel for myself... as the mega twist never came. The plot was definitely interesting, and the ending was gripping and worth the read... but don't pick it up wanting it to thoroughly mess with your mind like ""gone girl"" did... because it doesn't.This book is about fighting your inner demons, about finding your place in the world, your purpose. It is about the juxtaposition of the outside looking in, and what really happens on the inside. It is about making choices and living with their consequences. It is about love, jealousy and infidelity. It is about heartache and redemption. The idea of routine and riding the train daily is a really neat one. In the end, I really enjoyed this novel."
1679,Lucy Haynes,"Captivating story, flows well. It's flawed though - I couldn't understand why it was bought up at the end that Tom's fingernails had been ripped off from buying Megan's body, and yet no one noticed that earlier on in the book? Whether they were suspicious or not, it was a detail I would have liked to see earlier on. Tom gave no indications of being Megan's killer, and suspicions weren't led to him at all earlier on. That led me to the ""really?"" response when I realized it was him - not because the author hid it SO WELL, but because there were no leads to anyone reading the story tying it to him. An improvement on the story would be to include some of those details throughout the book, but still lead the reader away from being suspicious of Tom. Otherwise, I liked the perspectives of the 3 main female characters - I thought Megan's role in particular was very well written, and representative of how someone in her mental state and suffering through the pain of loss would have acted.4/5!"
1680,Liam Wheeler,"Wow, okay.Paula Hawkins' debut thriller is not to be trifled with. The writing is sharp, the characters are deep, and the plot is mostly solid. Overall, the comparisons to Gone Girl are pretty spot on--and that's some high praise, seeing as Gone Girl ended up being one of the biggest books and movies of 2014.We begin the story with a girl named Rachel, the same girl for which the book is named. She's a depressed alcoholic that spends her days in solitude, taking trains back and forth from London to her little suburbs on the edge of the city. Every day the train stops just outside a home with a young couple living inside, and for a minute or so, Rachel is able to live vicariously through this couple, imagining the life she's always wanted. She names them ""Jess"" and ""Jason"", and the story revolves around the way this couple becomes a part of Rachel's life.The one thing I will say is that this book is fast. I finished it in around eight hours (where Gone Girl took me a full day and a half). If you, like me, thought that Gone Girl was a little too slow (especially in the first third), then The Girl on the Train will probably be a better fit for you.One major problem I had with the book (and the reason why it's only getting four stars and not five) was the viewpoint-switching. The novel constantly switches between the three female leads, and often changes viewpoints at the most exciting parts, especially near the end. I found Anna's chapters to be mostly boring and pointless until the final fourth of the book, and I could have done without her saying the same things over and over for pages on end.Another problem came from the fact that the book seemed to devolve into melodrama at times, with a lot of twists and turns for seemingly no reason whatsoever. I'm glad that the ending tied everything up, but along the way I felt like areas of the plot became extremely tangential.Overall, however, I thought that it was a solid debut, and it kept my attention and adrenaline going. 4/5 stars."
1681,April Kane,"Well done. Figured out the killer early but did not foresee what I would call the final twist at the end. Read in about two days - so you know it was good. Story is told by multiple narrators, so I was occasionally checking the dates to see if things fit. By the way in this book no one is what they seem or what they appear. Rachel is the titular girl on the train. She’s a mess. She’s an alcoholic. Anna’s married to Rachel’s ex-husband and Megan is their neighbor. It’s a very small world. There’s a lot going on under these ladies’ surfaces.My only qualm is that I am not sure someone should get so involved in other people’s lives as Rachel does. I mean that did not seem realistic at all to me. But you know I still liked this book and would read more by this author."
1682,Teresa Rosenberg,"I just read another reviewer's comment that this book was much faster paced than Gone Girl in the beginning, but I really can't agree with that. The first third or so of this book, I thought, was a total slog. I felt bogged down, myself, in the misery of Rachel's alcoholism. I felt frustrated with her for not getting it together, for being so unreliable and dishonest (with others, with herself). Once I got through that much, though, it really started to flow for me, and I enjoyed the way the story unfolded very much. Now that I've finished it, I'm left with some uncomfortable feelings, as it wasn't exactly black-and-white, who was good and who was bad -- but this is probably a good stretch for me, mentally. Comparisons to Gone Girl are inevitable, but I thought this book was quite different from that one, aside from the obvious superficial parallels. I'm glad to have read each of them. "
1683,Yoli,"El libro está escrito en forma de diario con fechas y horas además de que los inicios de capítulos nos dicen quien lo está contando. Así pues tenemos 3 puntos de vista en el libro, el de Rachel, que será el mayoritario, el de Megan y el de Anna.Todo comienza con Rachel cogiendo el tren a la misma hora todos los días, ella se fijará siempre en la casa número 15 de la calle donde antes vivía con su exmarido Tom, ellos vivían en el número 23, pero cuando se divorciaron Tom paso a ocupar la casa con su nueva esposa Anna y su hijita Evie.Al principio podemos aburrirnos un poco porque todo pasa demasiado lento, pero después cuando Rachel nos va explicando las cosas vamos cogiendo ritmo. La protagonista que siempre viaja en el tren empezará a imaginar una vida para los residentes de la casa número 15, les pondrá nombres, Jess y Jason, pero lo que ella no sabe, es que su vida no es tal y como la imagina.- See more at: http://lectorade1994.blogspot.com.es/..."

1685,(ツ) Hache,"Definitely a good mystery/thriller book, half way through and I was addicted, I had that constant feeling to find out what really happened. Kept you guessing until the end.great read."
1686,Martitara,"No os voy a mentir, el misterio dejó de ser tal prácticamente desde el principio. Culpable y motivo predecibles, al menos para mí. Pero tampoco puedo negar que me ha enganchado (lo leí en un día, casi) y tengo muy claro por qué: los personajes. Lo que no me gusta de las novelas de misterio es que siempre intentan conseguir personajes profundos, y tanto intentarlo, fallan. Sin embargo, en La chica del tren los personajes son reales, y no solo eso, sino que llegas a entenderlos (que no ha justificarlos). "
1687,Klare,"A really good read, looking forward to the movie. "
1688,Muslim,"I really enjoyed listening to this book. It was more like a bed story for me,unravelling the mysteries that are spinning inside Rachel's head. Rachel is the girl who goes to London everyday ,pretending from her flatmate,Cathy,that she goes to work by train everyday,even though she has been fired for a long time. She looks through the train's window at two married couples everyday,whom appears to Rachel as being very happy and lucky,even though it is quite the reverse as the story goes on. The story is told through Rachel mainly ,Megan, and Anna too. Rachel starts to drink when they are told with Tom that she won't be able to conceive a baby,therefore she drinks until she finds out Tom is with another woman. This woman is Anna,who will have a child from Tom and marries him. Rachel is dissatisfied with her life and she is always drunk,suffering from her dizziness and hangover.The interesting thing about this novel is that the Author shows the psychological reactions inside Rachel's head and how she feels about the routines in her life. It is like a series of confessions about human nature.P.S. anyone who didn't enjoy reading this psychological novel and found it boring,try the audio book version of this novel."
1689,Robert,"With the level of alcoholism, cheating, lying, manipulation, and abuse that happens in the plot of The Girl on the Train, I found it hard to read. The characters make bad choices and then continue to make bad choices which affect the lives of everyone around them. There isn't a character whom I admire or would like to know in real life. But I would recommend the book for its quality of writing and pacing and suspense. The great Hitchcock classic, Rear Window, featured a witness who pieced clues together in full view of the murderer. He was incapacitated with a broken leg. The Girl on the Train features a witness who pieces memories together despite a debilitating addiction and derailing biases. She is incapacitated by her alcoholism and frequent blackouts. So many people drew similarities between this book and the classic film that I was ready for a pulse-quickening thriller.The Girl on the Train entwines the poor decisions of a young woman and the people around her into a messy, painful plot. What really happened? Did she imagine everything? Was she responsible for anything? And how will digging for the truth ruin her relationships with her ex-husband, her roommate, her mother, and her counselor? I hope that the characters in Paula Hawkins's next novel are not as dysfunctional. Because I look forward to reading it. ** I wonder if Paula Hawkins had a cameo in her book. ***"
1690,Perry Readers,"This book doesn't seem to really need any extra press, as it is the ""hot"" book right now. It is getting compared often to Gone Girl, and that is a reasonable comparison. Both feature highly unreliable female narrators, missing women, and questionable men. However, I enjoyed this book more.The story is told through the perspectives of three women, although Rachel is the main narrator. Rachel, the girl on the train, takes the rail into London to work daily (or does she?) and the route happens to take her past the home she previously shared with her husband. A husband who is now living in this same house with his new wife and child. The train is also often delayed beside another house in this same neighborhood, and Rachel has made a game of watching the occupants of this home and creating a story about their lives.Another narrator is Anna, the new wife of Rachel's ex-husband. We don't hear as much from her, but her perspective offers an interesting insight in to ""the other woman"". Lastly, we hear from Megan, the wife in the house Rachel watches from the train. The wife who goes missing. And Rachel feels she might know something about the disappearance, but she is blocked by one of her frequent alcoholic blackouts.Rachel's story can be painful to read at times, but she is stronger than she thinks. I found her to be a nice change from Amy in Gone Girl, who was hard to root for. Although you aren't really sure where Rachel is coming from, you can see her growth and resolve as the novel progresses.I don't really want to say any more, so as to not give any more away than I already have. I literally had trouble putting this book down, even reading as I brushed my teeth in the morning! The ending is thrilling and satisfying, which is always a concern with this type of book. Not all authors are able to pull it together, but Paula Hawkins does an excellent job. I look forward to her next book. (F Hawkins)"
1691,Farah,So at first I thought ya another story about a desperate women .. then it took a twist I never imagined .. though it has a very very slow start I still think it's amazing
1692,Zainab Mirah,"I love this book for the fact that it keeps you on edge the entire time. You don't know what's going on until the last couple of pages of the book. I love how the author used Rachel's drinking problem and her blackouts as a way to keep us so eager to know what Rachel couldn't remember. I don't think it's a creepier version of Gone Girl, but it's definitely creepy."
1693,Scarlett Sims,"So, in the genre of ""thrillers with multiple narrators and the word 'girl' in the title,"" I'd say this sits squarely between Gone Girl and The Good Girl. It was less predictable than the latter, and not quite as well-crafted as the former. I did enjoy listening to it; I think books with multiple narrators are always served well in audio, because the different voices can make up for any shortcomings the author has with actually writing different perspectives.The idea behind the book is great--a woman thinks she witnessed a crime, but is an alcoholic and was blacked out, so she isn't sure what happened. So she (and the reader) have to piece that together.For fans of books like this, I'm sure this would be really enjoyable, and I did enjoy it, but I might be reaching my saturation point in this particular niche."
1694,Carla Johnson-Hicks,"I had a hard time getting into this book and put it aside for a few days before trying again. Once I got a few chapters in, I was hooked.The story is told from the perspective of 3 characters. Rachel is the Girl on the Train. She is an alcoholic who is divorced and living with a girl from school. She often experiences blackouts. She travels to London every day for work and passes by her old house. She watches her house, where her ex-husband has remarried and has a child, as well as the house down the road. She imagines the couple who she names, in a happy life.Emma, the second narrator is the new wife. She does not like that Rachel calls the house and walks by. She wants Tom to call the police and have a restraining order against Rachel. She is worried for their child.Megan, the third narrator. This is the woman who Rachel watches from the train. Her life is not as idyllic as Rachel imagines it to be. When Megan goes missing, Rachel insinuates herself into the life of Scott, Megan's husband and the investigation of Megan's disappearance.A great suspenseful story of a disappearance and murder. Often compared to Gone Girl, but I think this was a much better book that I really enjoyed."
1695,Bradley Mott,"""The Girl on the Train"" is an interesting mix of characters a reader really can't love, and a story that deserves attention. It brings up the consequences of relationships that have soured, self-destructive tendencies, and many other broad concepts that deeply affect the characters in the book and the interactions that take place between them.While hard to believe, the entanglements between the characters feel natural, and to a degree you almost feel exposed to a level of mental instability that really brings into question whether or not the main character of the novel is telling you the truth, and if she would even know if she were lying to you. Purely from this perspective alone, it is an interesting read once the main plot gets moving (give it a few chapters... it's a slow starter).I would recommend this book to others, but I dislike the comparison to Gone Girl that has permeated the novel's rise to the NYT Bestseller list. There are stark contrasts that will leave readers feeling as though this novel is overrated, and to some degree I can see where that comes from. ""The Girl on the Train"" is a tough read because the characters are, almost unequivocally, portrayed as weak. While some of this works to further the plot, this almost becomes a defining characteristic, a dimension all to itself for each character. We deeply explore each one's personal failings, as if Hawkins is going out of her way to let us know that no character is perfect... no hero without stain. The result is an interesting story with characters who you feel just need a good bop on the back of the head to straighten up, and the weakness becomes a frustration for the reader as much as the other players in the novel. Having finished the book, I can't think of a single character I hope to see succeed in the future... nor do I really expect any of them to, and that's a hard conclusion to come to after such a thrilling plot.Overall this is a good novel, a naked look at a number of concerning vices in life, and a thrilling ride."
1696,Idril Celebrindal,"I had the hardest time deciding whether to give this 3 or 4 stars. I thought Hawkins did an excellent job with the characters, and with making dramatic events still seem like they could all plausibly happen to the same group of people, or that a person would make a certain choice because of an earlier event or choice. I've seen some reviews say all of the characters are bad people but I don't feel that way. They are definitely imperfect as people but in realistic ways, with plenty of shading and varied internal lives. They may fail themselves or hurt people but (as with real people) not all of them purely out of selfishness, immorality, or amorality.This book feels to me far less like an empty ""trick"" than Gone Girl did. Gone Girl was clever but pretty hollow; this book to me has a much realer feel."
1697,Heather,"It kind of blew my mind! I knew it would be a great mystery because of all the hype but I didn't expect such interesting and developed characters to elevate the book above a mystery. The psychology of the characters was fascinating to me and by far the best part of the book. The resolution of the mystery was actually a bit of a letdown for me, not because I found it obvious as some of the reviewers did, but because it didn't explain anything about why the killer was how he/she was or even how he/she thought and perceived things. This is odd in this story and cheapens it. Like the mystery that inexplicably and unrealistically ties up too neatly, we suddenly have an unexplained psychopath which is just easy and sloppy of the author. The story is told from multiple points of view so why not a chapter or two in the mind of the killer towards the end? That would be awesome. I have additional reasons for not liking the resolution but discussing them would include spoilers. Nevertheless, I will probably find myself reading it a second time and I highly recommend it."

1699,Elvan,"It's hard for me to decide how to categorize this book. Is it a thriller? Yes, definitely. There are moments of tension and terror. Is it a mystery? Yes again. First person POV from three main characters gives the reader a tunnel vision look at the events surrounding the crime. We know all will be revealed in time, we just have to wait for Rachel or Anna or Megan to get us there. While they dole out little bits of memory we get to speculate on our various suspects. Is it a police procedural? Not even close. If I have a beef about this book it is the inept and underwhelming efforts made by the detectives investigating the murder.I am glad I listened to the audiobook. The readers were excellent. The time shifting between Rachel and Megan was a bit confusing at first but I figured out what was going on after a bit of replaying. This is one of those books where clues are scattered here and there randomly. The mystery readers among you will narrow down your suspects quickly enough. I now understand what all the hype was about this book. The only comparison that I can see to Gone Girl is that this will definitely be coming to a theatre near you in the next few years. "

""I once read a book by a former alcoholic where she described giving oral sex to two different men, men she'd just met in a restaurant on a busy London high street. I read it and thought, I'm not that bad. This is where the bar is set."" 
  - Rachel (yes Karen, this is the most demonstrative quote for this book!)This book deserves its own category: women's horror. Stephen King's Jack and Danny Torrence from The Shining & Doctor Sleep showed the violence and shocking depths alcoholics find themselves in. Alcoholism in a woman, written by a woman, is worse. Rachel is worse. I cringed through this whole book and not just at Rachel's actions, Megan and Anna are no pearls. This book could have been Train Wreck: Women Making Poor Choices.  I couldn't stop listening. I finished it in a day. Maybe it's because it reminded me of some of my own poor choices, but this had me burying my face in my hands and groaning in shame. As Rachel says, ""the sense of shame I feel about an incident is proportionate not just to the gravity of the situation, but also to the number of people who witnessed it.""  Listening to this book was like seeing the worst moment of my life in a viral video. HORROR!!!"
1701,Carol Wiilliams,Very much reminded me of Gone Girl. A very good read!
1702,Clare Bird,"I will preface with this, I listened to this one on audio book. So occasionally it was hard to keep up with the plot because it jumped characters so much. Overall, I felt like it had the same feeling of Gone Girl-and that is not an original thought, it has been said before- but it was a thrilling mystery. I loved seeing the character development and where the story lead. I was happy with the ending in this book and would recommend it to those seeking a scary (ish) book. It did have foul language which drove me nuts. But overall pretty good!"

”I still think it would be wonderful to have a man love you so much he’d kill for you.”- Strangers on a Train”
Setting:Ashbury and London, England; 2012-2013Coverly Love?:No; I love the typography on the cover. It reminds someone of how the letters would look if a train were actually moving. But it’s kind of boring, to be honest. Plot:
”One for sorrow, two for joy, three for a girl, four for a boy, five for silver, six for gold, seven for a secret never to be told.”
Do you ever wonder, when you’re traveling on your daily commute to work, walking around your school campus, or just sitting at some nondescript park or shopping mall, what other people’s lives are like? Are they happy with where they’re heading, are they married, have children? This is what Rachel Watson does every day on her daily commute to London on the train. She likes to observe one couple in particular. She calls them Jess and Jason, and to her, they seem to have a perfect life. Better than hers is at the moment. An overweight, depressed, alcoholic recovering from a bitter divorce and her ex-husband marrying the woman he cheated on her with. Jess and Jason are her escape, the only uplifting part of a normally dismal day. That is, until Rachel sees something. And then Jess goes missing. She knows she has to report it to the police, but who would ever believe a serial drunk? How reliable would they think she really is? And becoming entangled in the mystery of her golden couple will land her smack dab into the affairs of her ex-husband and his new wife, much to their dismay. In this twisted game of cat and mouse, who can be trusted?I should probably give due warning here: Please don’t compare this to Gone Girl. I don’t know why everybody and his brothers wants to compare the next big psychological thriller to it, but it’s getting old real fast. Let this book stand on its own, and when you do, it becomes utterly compelling. The Girl on the Trainis one of those books that you simply cannot put down. You have to find out what’s next, or you get this restless feeling in your mind. It’s what I like to call a “popcorn thriller”; it doesn’t make you think, but it’s highly enjoyable to say the least. All of the characters may be completely unlikable and the plot may seem like the same old, same old, but it’s just as thrilling and suspenseful. You don’t know who to trust, like or believe.Characters:
”I am not the girl I used to be. I am no longer desirable, I’m off-putting in some way. It’s not just that I’ve put on weight, or that my face is puffy from the drinking and the lack of sleep; it’s as if people can see the damage written all over me, can see it in my face, the way I hold myself, the way I move.”
 Rachel, to put it lightly, is not in the best place in her life. A severely depressed alcoholic who’s recently divorced, humiliated by the fact that she’s been cast aside for a prettier, more “put together” woman, the only bright spots of her day are when she’s holding her bottle of whatever alcohol she’s in the mood for and her train rides. This allows her to shut her off. A lot of you probably won’t like Rachel because of here severe unreliability and careless, needy nature, but in an odd way, she seems real. She’s not over the top nutters, and the more you read about her, the more you understand what lead her to this point. 
”He won’t say no to me. I was thinking about it on the way home, and that’s the thing I like most about it, having power over someone. That’s the intoxicating thing. ”
 Jess’s name really isn’t Jess. Jess is really Megan Hipwell, married to Scott Hipwell, former owner of a failed art gallery who doesn’t seem to know what she wants to do with her life. Whose unhappiness in her marriage leads her to having a sordid affair. Who also happens to hide a deep, dark secret she covers up with layers and layers of lies. The girl that goes missing, and no one seems to know where she is. And when they do, and her secrets start to come out of the closet, those closest to her start to wonder if they ever knew her at all. 
”Being the other woman is a huge turn-on, there’s no point denying it; you’re the one he can’t help but betray his wife for, even though he loves her. That’s just how irresistible you are.”
 Anna is the woman who essentially replaced Rachel. The “other woman”. And she liked it. There are no warm feelings between Rachel and Anna, and Anna doesn’t feel the least bit sorry about the part she played to Rachel’s path to self-destruction. She has her picture perfect life with her handsome husband and beautiful daughter. But as the old saying goes, looks can be deceiving. Soon the cracks begin to show, and picture perfect Anna isn’t sure how to deal with it all. Anna was probably the only narrator you mostly liked, at least that was in my case. Pros:The unique thing about this book is that all the characters are ones who you alternately want to slap across the face on one page and then immediately feel sorry for on the next. It takes a good writer to make you feel both sympathy and hatred for their characters, often at the same time or within a span of a few words. Paula Hawkins also has a wonderful writing style that makes her book easy to read. Cons:If you haven’t already heard, this book has been essentially called the next Gone Girl. If you walk into this book completely expecting it to be just that, you’ll probably be disappointed. And if someone were to directly ask me which of the two I liked better, I would have to say Gone Girl, because Gillian Flynn is just so bloody brilliant in her writing and ability to create effed up characters. While this book was sensational, it wasn’t quite as sensational as its predecessor. Love Triangle?:Well, Tom is a philandering SOB, so there’s plenty of love triangles going on here. We already know he cheated on Rachel with Anna, and Megan was having an affair of her own. But there’s plenty more where this came from (and you’ll have to read it to find out.)Instalove?:Nope!A Little Romance?:Let’s just get this out of the way folks; true love doesn’t exist in this book. In fact, I highly doubt love exists in this book at all. I say this because there are literally zero romantic connections between any of the main characters and their main squeezes. There may have been at one time, but when we are introduced to them, it’s long gone. Rachel’s love life is basically hopeless, Megan’s not happy with Scott, and while Anna and Tom are seemingly the only happily blissful couple in the book, rest assured something fishy is going on. Especially with Tom being such a cad. Conclusion:For some, they may see the ending from a mile away. It may seem a bit ridiculous, but it’s actually brilliant in a twisted way. Not Gone Girl brilliant (here I go again), but enough to surprise the reader enough to it to not be totally unexpected. A fast-paced thrilling read that you won’t be able to put down. And the next time you head to work or go to school, you may be looking and wondering at strangers more than before. Keep an Eye Out for This!:The film rights to this book have already been optioned by DreamWorks, so look out for this to (potentially) come to a theater near you! "
1706,Rachel Schieffelbein,"This one started a bit slow for me, but once it got going I was very drawn in. Everyone seemed a bit crazy, so there was plenty to keep me guessing! "
1707,Kendall,"I would almost say I loved this book. I liked it better than Gone Girl, even if it was an infinitesimal amount. This book has the twisty characters you love to hate and still root for anyway, without some of the excessive 'ick' factor I felt in Gone Girl. It perhaps a tad less dark and seemed more based in reality...something I could legitimately see happening in real life.If you're looking for a good, dark mystery (especially an audiobook version for commuting!) this is your piece."
1708,Emily Bullough,"For full effect, I recommend reading this thriller on a commuter train. "
1709,Chuck,None of the characters are likable. But the book still is.....go figure.
1710,Claire,"Definitely 4 stars, may be 4.5. Although it was a difficult book to read : three different voices telling the story, three diffrerent women and with two different time frames.Maybe my brain is not what it used to be, but I found it tough, and I often went backwards to check the time stamp on the chapters.But then I reached the half of the book, and the pace started to increase : the chapters were shorter, the two time frames were getting closer to each other, and I could not put the book down any longer (well the Kindle actually).This book really is good stuff."
1711,Sanujo,"Inicio muito monótono, depois empolgante, gostei, ainda bem que dei mais uma oportunidade."
1712,Kayla Felten,"The Girl on the Train was a very good read! I finished the book within three days. I would describe the book as a thriller. Throughout most of my read, I was asking questions, trying to piece things together, and turning immediately to the next page to find answers. I did not want to put this book down and would have finished it in one day had I not been a college student who needed to study. I enjoyed how Hawkins wrote and provided a lot of dialogue throughout the story. I was able to clearly envision the whole story in my head as if it were a movie (which I hope it becomes). I found myself thinking about what was going to happen next in this book while at work and in class and could not wait to pick the book back up again. The book is told in first person point of view by three female characters: Rachel, Megan, and Anna. You get a glimpse of each narrators lives and as you read you try to piece together the mystery. Rachel is the main character of the story. Rachel is a depressed, alcoholic who divorced her husband because he had an affair. Rachel's divorce, and seeing her ex-husband with Anna (the other woman) and their child all enable Rachel's drinking. One thing that is constant in Rachel's daily life is riding the train twice a day. Rachel rides on the train and observes life going on from behind the window of the train. The train passes by Rachel's old neighborhood and this leads to stories from Rachel's past. Every day Rachel also sees a couple outside together. Rachel takes notice of the couple's gestures, appearances, and home environment. Rachel creates this picture perfect romance between this couple in her mind. When an investigation arises involving Megan (the girl from the couple that Rachel observes), Rachel feels she could be helpful because of her observations and her nearby locations on certain days. Will Rachel's input help the investigation? Will Rachel's input hurt the investigation? You'll have to read the story to find out yourself. The book is very intriguing and a great read. One thing that did disappoint me though was the ending. The entire lead up to the ending was great and I suppose I imagined something more intriguing and less cliche for an ending. Towards the end of the story I found myself losing some interest because the story became quite repetitive and cliche. Overall, this book is a good read. I enjoyed analyzing what was going to happen and getting a glimpse of different characters live's and stories and intertwining them together in my own way to figure out the story.Recommend this story for a quick, enjoyable read! "
1713,Anuj,"make everyone look like a victim, And boom! you're clueless. An unimaginable mystery plot and a great page turner! "
1714,MaryPat,"Great psychological thriller that will keep you guessing until the very end. We all observe other people when we are out/traveling/commuting but how many of us actually believe we know what's going on with strangers and their lives? That's exactly what happens with The Girl on the Train. Rachel, a divorced drunk who has lost her job still rides the train into London every day & observes a young couple out the train window. She creates a story about them & their happy life (even giving them the names Jess & Jason). One day, Rachel sees Jess with another man in a romantic embrace in her own yard & then discovers that Jess (really Megan) has gone missing. Rachel decides she must get involved because of what she's witnessed out the train window. Told from alternating voices, Rachel (the drunk), Megan (the cheater & missing girl) & Anna (Rachel's ex husband's new wife), the story is fast paced with plenty of backstory & motive from several characters. So why not 5 stars? Well, I thought the therapist was a little weak-he didn't add much to the story. And we never find out how Megan's past gets revealed to the press. I have a guess & maybe that's what the author intended. "
1715,Charlie Rocha,4.3/5 ★
1716,Doug Seaberg,"Very entertaining. The pages almost seem to turn themselves. Hawkins use of first-person narrative to tell the story was creative and allowed her to develop the characters of the three women in this story, each deeply troubled and insecure in their own ways. The character of Rachel was especially well developed and I wished Hawkins could have gone deeper with the other two. I also found something lacking in the climax. The big action sequence just didn't seem right and Anna's reaction did not ring true. However, this is a perfect summer ""beach"" book. Quick read and fun. You want to find out what happens to these people."
1717,Lesley Book Lover ,"A good murder mystery, well written and certainly a book to get everyone talking."
1718,Sarahoria,"No me ha durado ni 24 horas. Aunque bastante predecible (en seguida imaginé quién era el/la asesino/a), engancha. Hay que tener un poco de paciencia al principio. Me lo imagino con adaptación cinematográfica. Le doy 3,5 estrellas"
1719,Renato O.,"Uma obra onde o as pequenas coisas que preenchem os nossos dias e as grandes coisas que preenchem as nossas vidas se miscigenam - e pequenas fantasias dão lugar a novas realidades - com tonalidades vivas e contrastes escuros.Este thriller leva-nos na espiral descendente que é a vida de Rachel - espiral essa que se traduz numa montanha-russa de emoções e sentimentos no leitor: as imagens e ideias construídas ao longo da obra rapidamente são transformadas e repensadas; as personagens que pensamos conhecer e compreender revelam-se cada vez mais complexas, verdadeiras e intrigantes; os cenários tão mundanos que iludem e confundem com o comum do dia-a-dia, realçando o realismo e sentimento de presença ao longo da narrativa. Uma das particularidades desta obra é a sua capacidade para mostrar dois lados de cada ação. A autora não foca apenas os eventos que rodeiam a protagonista e como estes a afetam, mas também como são interpretados e vividos por todos envolvidos.Uma obra de leitura fácil, viciante e aconselhada a todos interessados no cativante do inesperado."
1720,Kelly Glenn,I thought I was going to be confused throughout the book with all the back and forth but I wasn't. I couldn't put the book down. I kept changing my mind about the outcome. I really liked it.
1721,Nicole,Good suspense!Like Gone Girl but still really enjoyable. The three points of view gave me insight into each perspective and the end was good!
1722,Cate,"So as far as the comparison to Gone Girl goes, I'd say... not really. Yes, it is a thriller and, yes, all 3 female characters are whack jobs but none of them has anything on Amy Dunne! As far as the plot, I really liked how the mystery unfolds and how Rachel's life becomes linked with Anna and Megan. I started out really disliking Rachel but she grew on me as the story progressed, and she ended up being my favorite character by the end of the novel. I really got wrapped up in her black holes and mixed up memories and her struggle with alcohol. What is weird is that the closer I got to the denouement, the less engaged I became in the story. I feel like the ending was a bit too quickly paced so I lost the anxiety and build up because things unraveled too fast. Nevertheless, it was thoroughly enjoyable and mostly engrossing read!"
1723,One-Click,"Audiobook4.5 solid starsNarration - Clare Corbett, Louise Brealey, India Fisher - Really GoodThere are three female MC's and for each of their POV's, there is a different narrator. They all have British accents, and I can listen to a British, Aussie, or Scottish narrators ALL DAY LONG! But the story? Oh My Gosh. Is it a romance? Hmmm...Could beIs it a mystery? Uhhh...DefinitelyIs it suspenseful? Mmmm...Maybe a little?Is it strange? Uhmm...yip!Actually, I didn't really know ANYTHING about this book and I think that was the best way to go about it. Had no idea what to expect. What a strange, twisty plot this little number had to it. So, to make this a good read for you, I'm saying nothing about it, except I loved it! "
1724,Michelle,"Book titles are more important than people realize. Their mission is to evoke intrigue, attract the reader, and make them wonder what the story is about all within a word or a sentence. The Girl on the Train is a great example of that; when I first scanned the title, I thought, “Who is this girl? What happens on the train?” So my imagination began to shape different scenarios of what could be held within these pages…and I should have stopped there, because this novel that held such great hope turned out to be just another ‘wannabe’ thriller. The story of The Girl on the Train is simple enough: English commuter and alcoholic Rachel Watson’s life has gone to shambles, and she has done nothing to make it better. Her husband divorced her because of her alcoholism (the causes behind it don’t make it more justifiable but a bit more understandable), his mistress moved into their home after she was kicked out, and now she spends her free time pretending to go to work by riding the train to and from London. As she looks out the window, she makes careful observations of the scenery and takes a special interest in the new neighbors a couple of doors down from her old house; giving them fake names, (Jason and Jess) and an imaginary life that placates her own fantasies.One morning on the train, Rachel noticed Megan (aka Jess) outside with another man, which becomes the catalyst to a string of terrible events. (Hence the name, The Girl on the Train…) Soon there's a disappearance, and Rachel gets in over her head by not understanding the difference between being helpful and being a pest, especially in an investigation where she may be a suspect.What saved this novel was the writing and the pace. Hawkins knew how to get you sucked into the story, (which may come from her 15 years’ experience as a journalist) and relate to the characters on some pretty deep levels. She’s so good with conjuring emotion that I found myself steaming with frustration toward Rachel’s character. If the story was centered on her, why not make her a strong heroine? Why make her a pathetic alcoholic who, granted was a good person, lets her poor judgement affect her decisions? If she was to have started off this way and then grow into a stronger, more confident person, then I would feel differently, but there was no growth in Rachel. Yes, she was able to take down her own demons by the end but I don’t give her credit for doing so. She didn’t go searching for them to become a better person, she took them down because they were right there in her face and had no choice.It may not sound like it but The Girl on the Train was honestly a good, solid novel. As I said, there are great characters (despite Rachel’s shortcomings) that are extremely real and complex, a great pace that will keep you reading to the end, and a decent twist that will leave you momentarily satisfied. Unfortunately, compared to other thrillers I’ve read, this did not stand up to them and made me wonder if this novel should have been about a different girl on a different train."
1725,Kathleen,"If you've heard the hype for this book you might have heard it compared to Gone Girl and I have to say that I agree 100%. I thought it was a complete page-turner, a psychological thriller that kept me guessing till the very end."
1726,Isvari Verre,Fun beach book. I really enjoyed it and thought it was hard to put down. 
1727,Diego José,"La Chica del Tren es un thriller diferente, tanto por su ambientación, como por sus personajes. Nada policíaca, me ha recordado mucho a Perdida (sin llegar a ser tan buena, of course)Su personaje principal es patético y eso es una novedad. La trama avanza bien y se hace corto el libro, aunque sí es cierto que el principio es totalmente atípico y sorprende. El giro final es un pelín forzado pero aun así es bueno. Puede que me la hay matado un poco el hype, pero es una buena novela negra.Veremos si su adaptación cinematográfica es tan buena"
1728,Sherrie,"Well that was interesting! The Girl on the Train is a twisted story of relationships, secrets, betrayals and murder. This book is the very definition of unreliable narrator, everyone in the book has a hidden agenda and massages the truth to produce the results they want. I'm not going to give a plot synopsis in this review because I feel this book is better enjoyed the fewer details you know beforehand. I highly recommend this book, so grab a copy, strap on your seatbelt and enjoy the (wild) ride. "
1729,Donna Barnes,"I was so impressed with the style of this book, that after I read it, I suggested it as our next book for our book club --- it is coming up this Thursday, so I'm not quite sure how they liked it, but I found it most enjoyable. And to know that it has been number 1 since coming out on the best sellers' list makes it even better because I read a book lots of people like and are talking about. I enjoy mysteries, and this was a lot like ""Gone Girl"" in how unorthodox the style of writing was --- once again, there are very few people to like in the book (like Gone Girl), and the narration goes back and forth from one unreliable narrator to the next, while the reader tries to sift through the data to get to the truth and hopefully guess who the killer is before it is totally revealed to us. I esp. liked the opening in its Hitchcockian way of revealing the characters to us.....some books are so pedantic about the exposition, but this took right off. The middle part is where it gets a tad confusing, and right before it goes into high gear, there were a few passages that seemed to get annoying and tedious..... in fact, I started to question whether this book was showing women in a bad light or not, but then when it got to the ending, I was sure I was glad I read it. If you do pick this up, I suggest you have a time line next to you like I used for Time Traveler's Wife, because all the dates can be annoying because you really need to pay attention to them and details. But that's what I liked and I highly recommend this one!"
1730,Thaddeus Johnson,I'd give it 4.5 stars. Characters were amazing but I wanted more at the end. Very minimal complaint as the entire book was a great read.
1731,Shanmugeshwari,"I'd say this book is the creepier version of Gone Girl with soooo many knots in it. It was really thrilling and exciting to read. If you're a crime/suspense lover you'd finish this book in a single sitting.(I took months to complete this book because... college!!) Overall, no wonder people compared it to Gone Girl. The Girl on the Train got shades of Gone Girl, which could annoy you if you're really fanatic over Gone Girl. Gone girl impressed me with its sleek writing. The writing and mystery were so alligned and neat.On the other hand, The Girl on the Train seemed scattered in writing, it wasn't as perfect as the Gone Girl style (at least to me). And, like Gone Girl, it had so many entwined secrets which were finally resolved in a most unpredictable way!"
1732,Rosie,"'The Girl on the Train' by Paula Hawkins is one that I have seen everywhere - in the bookshop, the supermarket, advertised online. I debated buying the book for a long time, but it was only when I got hold of the audiobook that I actually started listening to the story. The story takes on the perspectives of three women - Rachel, an alcoholic; Megan, a cheat; and Anna, the mistress. Soon their lives and stories become entwined as Rachel forces herself into a missing person's case, which soon turns into a murder mystery. None of the narrators were particularly reliable, which ended up leading the reader on an enjoyable wild goose chase as you try and work out the truth of what happened.None of the main characters are particularly likable, and yet you end up liking them for that very reason (with the exception of Anna). Their lives are complete messes, each with their own issues and difficulties. I really enjoyed seeing how, through the different POVs, you could see how one's perspective of a person can be very different from who that person actually is - you never know the whole side of the story. The mystery was interesting, although the solution was fairly predictable and, if I'm honest, the reasoning behind it seemed a bit off. However, what really kept me going was exploring the characters, joining them on their various journeys. I really admired Rachel's development, and I could really get on board with her as a person, despairing and applauding her. Megan was also a fascinating character, she clearly had deeply ingrained problems and seeing things from her perspective - the reasoning behind why she did certain things, was interesting. Anna was the only one of the three that I could not really get into - there was very little character development as you did not spend enough time with her in comparison to the other two characters, and I was not a huge fan of her voice actress, which pulled me out of the story a bit. That being said, it was a really good book. The dates were confusing, and it did get a bit repetitive and tedious in the middle, but otherwise I really enjoyed listening to it and it sounds like a book that is quite good on the page as well. "
1733,Jesús Sayago,"Mucho más entretenida de lo que me esperaba. Un poco previsible al final, pero su adictiva narrativa te acaba enganchando hasta la última página."
1734,Jim Heskett,"In some ways, reminds me of The Good Girl - alternating first person POVs that time jump. But it's much better than that book. It's called a thriller, but it's a little too slow paced for that. I'd call it a mystery, and a good one at that"
1735,Molly,"Rachel takes the train twice a day, every day. Every day, she looks out her window, and every day, she sees an attractive couple who she imagines to be perfect together. One day, however, her view of them is shattered when she sees the woman kiss another man. Not long after, the woman (who she learns is named Megan) goes missing. Rachel finds herself inserted in the situation both because she was seen in Megan's neighborhood that night (her ex-husband, Tom; his new wife, Anna; and their young daughter, Evie, live nearby) and because she chooses to tell both the police and Megan's husband, Scott, about the man she saw Megan kissing, thinking this man might be a suspect. The police consider her unreliable, however, because she has a drinking problem; she admits that she does not clearly remember the events of the night Megan went missing. Further complicating things is the fact that she is having trouble letting her marriage to Tom go. Shifting between the first-person perspectives of Rachel, Megan, and Anna, the book slowly reveals the events of that night, exploring the connections between the characters involved.The narration of the book, as well as the way the events slowly unfold, is very intriguing. You are initially positioned to view Rachel's version of events with suspicion, as the police and some of the other characters do, only to slowly realize that though, yes, she does have a drinking problem, that doesn't make her wrong about everything...and there are characters with much, much worse problems than she has, characters who actively work to both exacerbate her drinking problem and make her question her own memory and sanity.(view spoiler)[The more we learn about Rachel's ex-husband, Tom, the more he gives the reader chills. He does so many wrong things, and is so good at both justifying his actions and at getting the women in his life to blame themselves or each other rather than him, that he is likely to make readers sick to their stomachs. If you've EVER been with a romantic partner who was an expert at getting you to question your own interpretation of reality, who was able to make you like them even as they did horrible things to you, who managed to make you angry at and suspicious of everyone in the situation BUT them, you will be deeply, deeply disturbed at how wrong things can go when a person like that is involved. (hide spoiler)]As a whole, the book was a very satisfying reading experience, with characters who perhaps seem a bit over the top at times, yet have just enough recognizable qualities and characteristics that you won't doubt that people like them could exist. This is a very well-told mystery and thriller."
1736,Trista Bordignon,This was a great vacation read. I agree with everyone who said it is similar to Gone Girl. I will say about halfway through the book I was able to figure out who the killer was but I still enjoyed the process of getting there.
1737,Melissa Grace,"In the quest to find another ""Gone Girl,"" I picked this book up. It was also nominated for one of the best books this year, and I can see why. As a thriller/mystery, this book does a great job of keeping the author in a constant state of wondering and suspense. The book is narrated by 3 women: Rachel, Anna, and Megan. Rachel and Megan's voices sounded very similar to me, so it was hard sometimes to remember whose narration I was reading. Both are self-pitying, younger women who are unsatisfied with their romantic lives.The ending was somewhat unexpected, but with such a small cast, it was easy to point the finger at everyone. The climax was satisfying, and I especially appreciated the way that the women in this novel were able to pull themselves out and overtake the murderer without help from the authorities. Overall, this was a great and exciting read, but it's not necessarily a mind-bending thriller filled with plot twists."
1738,Ale Rivero,"¿Qué decir de La chica del tren? Está dentro de un género que no es de mis favoritos, y para ser sincera solo la he leído por toda la publicidad que le han dado.En sí, la historia me ha parecido interesante por la variación de las voces narrativas, quienes la cuentan son las tres protagonistas principales -Rachel, Megan y Anna-, aunque Rachel es la que más predomina. Los persomajes masculinos solo se ven retratados a través de ellas.La forma cronológica en que se van contando los hechos, al menos para mí, ha hecho solo que mis hipótesis sobre la responsabilidad del asunto solo variaran entre los personajes; por supuesto que llegados a cierto punto de la historia resulta más que obvio, pero para ese momento yo ya quería saber el porqué total así que no me preocupaba. Además, la explosión de acción en las últimas páginas resulta vivificadora para el final.En definitiva ha sido una historia que me ha enganchado y entretenido, y reconozco que para los acostumbrados al género no debe ser de lo mejor. Recomendable."
1739,Ryan,"Great, fast, suspenseful read. I spent much of this book intrigued by the concept of gin and tonic in cans."
1740,Joei,"Everyone called this the ""next Gone Girl"" but I think that's too much. The book is a page turner, yes, but I say it's still a far cry from Gone Girl. For one, I already guessed 'whodunit' halfway through the book. And after all has been said and done, it doesn't leave that ""WTF"" feeling Gone Girl is so known for.That being said, I would still recommend this book if you're looking for a psychological thriller to read. It's gripping and gives it share of a mind f*ck. 4 stars."
1741,Betty Stauffer,Great read. Don't read the last half of the book unless you have time to finish it because you won't be able to put it down!
1742,Rachel Maniacup,"I can't believe I got really stuck on this book that long?!Maybe because I got bored with the dates in this book(I would appreciate the date flashes in movies)and maybe because of it's slow pacing.Or maybe because I've been reading some other books that interested me more.I know it sounds unfair but I'm not done yet,right?After reading the books I was currently reading,I've been deciding what to read next and when I saw that this book's still on my currently reading status,I read the synopsis so It may refresh me what the story is all about from where I stopped and marked this book. It's then that I realized that I should have finished reading this novel right the moment I've started it.This is a well-written absolutely plotted psychological thriller that will make you think and suspect who the real killer is.(It's not too far into the book that I've already guessed the culprit)And this is the reason why I never put this book down the moment I continued reading it.I just didn't like the main character or the main narrator here whose name is also Rachel!OMG!She's so annoying!LOL(But then,I liked her at the last part)^^This is highly recommended to psychological suspense thriller readers."
1743,Jackie Bryant,3.5*s
1744,Mateo Fisher,"I read this book because my wife had just finished it and wanted someone to talk about it with. It gets a lot of comparisons to Gone Girl, which are probably apt (I never read Gone Girl but I did see the movie), as they both are thrillers that double as through provoking social commentary on infidelity, marriage, family etc. For my money, this is what a thriller should be. I felt myself compelled to keep on reading as I was completely caught up in all the twists and turns, but even when the pace or logic faltered it was forgivable because I felt like there was enough interesting exploration into the overall themes to keep me engaged. So if anyone tells you this book was boring because they ""figured it out"" halfway in, they are missing half the point (but if that's your whole thing, then yes, it's possible to figure it out at least 2/3 in).I'm also a big sucker for books with multiple viewpoints because it's a lot easier to add a level of richness to a set of events when an author explores it from a few angles. Hawkins does a great job of fleshing out three characters who are unique enough that they stand on their own, but similar enough that they are fun to compare. My only criticism really, and it's a light one, is that sometimes descriptions of motivations for characters get a little repetitive and tough to stomach. It's probably necessary given the time frame of the narrative, but maybe Hawkins could have trusted the reader a little more to keep in mind that alcoholics will do alcoholic things, and not re-explain the character's mindset before each episode. But I don't know, maybe I would have forgotten. Anyway, it was a good quick read and-hot take- if you like thrillers, you'll like this one!"
1745,Carole Van domelen,Not a single likable character...just a really good read.
1746,Hy-C,"This is a pretty amazing book! Each of the character seems terrible and that should make this book awful but it isn't. It just adds to the mystery as each events unfold.Like anyone on this book is capable of such an act,and believe me, I searched for motives and means. And still I am unsure of who did what. As being compared to Gone Girl,and I saw why but I honestly think The Girl on the Train shone light on itself. It has its own dark twisted secrets to unfold.Kudos to Ms.Paula Hawkins!"
1747,B.P. Morrison,"You know, this was good. I was expecting another Gone Girl, since this is being billed as such; but the comparison was only in popularity. With the comparison, this book seems above average, but without it I think the book would have been much better.I did not see some of the twists coming, and overall it was a good read.Give Hawkins a break; for a debut, it proves there's a great new talent in the field of thrillers."
1748,Regina,"Wow, this book is a bit of a rush. It's almost impossible to put down, and I did get quite a way through before I starting making any correct assumptions about how it would end. There is not one single likeable character in this book. That's not to say the characters aren't interesting, just terribly flawed and unhappy. I don't want to give anything away, but the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the last couple of chapters made me picture Jennifer Lopez in the movie version. Anyway, worth the read, for sure."
1749,Trudi,"Not a happy book, no sympathetic characters, but an intriguing book. When Rachel takes the commuter train every day, she passes a house in her old neighborhood and builds a fantasy around a young couple living in that house. After the wife is murdered, Rachel even meets the husband. And she also continues to harass her former husband and his new wife. A murder mystery with twists and turns to the plot plus a look at the life of an alcoholic (Rachel) and how damaging addiction can be."
1750,Nicole~,"Rightly so, some have compared Hawkins's new thriller The Girl on the Train to Flynn's Gone Girl, with respect to similarly flawed and unlikable characters. Here, the story is narrated by three women whose marriages are in varied stages of (dis)assembly, who all have lived on the same street - their morbid connection becomes clear when one of them goes missing. An engaging, fast read with a quite realistic portrait of alcoholism and the psychotic demons it creates, this gripping, psychological mystery was a pleasing quicky right on schedule."
1751,Nicki,"I've rated this highly as it was a real page turner, but it definitely did have its issues. Like Gone Girl, there's not one truly likeable character in the whole book. The women really are exceptionally weak, and anyone who reads my reviews (all two of you!) would know by now that I get a bit annoyed reading about women who are all about babies. Well, this book has got three of them. Rachel became an alcoholic because she couldn't have a baby. Megan is wracked with guilt because she accidentally killed her baby (I also didn't like the attitude towards her based on that - she was exhausted and she made a mistake. There was a lot of ""she got what she deserved"" ""she was a monster"" happening here, which struck me as rough) . Anna was just - ugh! - moved in on Rachel's husband and instantly supplied the child Rachel couldn't. Hello, could we have at least one character of the three who isn't motivated by that?! The men are hardly any better. Cheating, lying, abusive. Wow, I thought I had a low opinion of people - this author tops me! The actual book is pretty good. Flows along at a good pace. Read it very quickly - couldn't put it down. I did guess the twist before the end, but I suspected a few others first. Overall it is a pretty good thriller, which could have been great with a bit more thought put into the characters."
1752,Amy O'Brien-Gulka,Finally! It took me three months but I managed to finish it. First book that I have finished since baby was born. I am hapoy it was this one. what a great read. It was compelling and wonderfully written. It was overflowing with suspense and was really good at making you feel kind of dirty and ashamed as you read from the perspective of each character. The ending was slightly lackluster but very fitting with a nice twist.
1753,Carla Dente,"Las primeras 200 páginas no me engancharon y fueron un 3/5, desde ahí hasta la 300 fue un 3,5/5 y a partir de ahí fue muuuuuuy bueno! así que me decidí por darle 4/5Próximamente la reseña en:http://mimundoestaentuspaginas.blogsp..."
1754,Martin Baggs,"Paula Hawkins’ debut psychological thriller, The Girl on the Train, brings deserved comparison to Gillian Flynn’s Gone Girl. Both have chapters that are written from different perspectives and both have complex and damaged characters in their dark centers.The main protagonist is Rachel, a 20-something who is the titular character whose London train commute takes her past the back garden of “Jason and Jess” a young couple. At least that is the name she has concocted for them. She has crafted an imaginary picture of their lives, as though she knows them. But when she witnesses something, in a “Rear Window” kind of way, she convinces herself she must get involved to solve the mystery.Hawkins uses two other female characters to narrate chapters. She also alternates the recent past, as seen from the eyes of Megan, with the current situation of Rachel and Anna, the wife ofRachel’s ex-husband.As the story progresses, we see each of one of these characters has their own problems, although they may be in self-denial.The beauty and the thrill is in the confusion that each brings to the plot. Certainly, a theme Hawkins explores is how we can be so sure of what we see or have imagined, only to be so self-deceived. And we then often flip to the opposite extreme, becoming as convinced of this “truth” as we were of the former.The Girl on the Train suffers like Gone Girl from unlikable characters. But the conclusion is a little more satisfying.Grade: A-"
1755,Millie,"I liked this book, the way it was written & the characters. I thought it was a very good debut novel. Very fast-paced and really captured my interest. A classic ""who dunnit,"" with crazy, pathological liars and alcoholics as characters, make for a believable psycho-thriller. I've read reviews that compared it to Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl, but, for me, there isn't much comparison. "
1756,Salsadancer,"The Girl on the Train uses the same construct device as A Visit From the Goon Squad -- story told from different character's point of view and in different time frames -- but this book is as good as that one was bad! Paula Hawkins was able to use the device to develop the story and tension in a way it could not have been accomplished otherwise, creating a tight, suspenseful chiller. The book alternates among three women's stories, with Rachel, reeling from her divorce, as the primary narrator. Each morning during her commute from a suburb into London, her train slows on the same section of track behind a row of Victorian houses. Two houses there interest her: one is her former residence and the current home of her ex-husband, Tom, and his new wife, Anna; the other is home to an attractive, couple who frequently appear on their back terrace. Anna and the attractive woman are the other two points of view telling the story which propels along, picking up speed as the story develops. "
1757,Ana Bierle czernek,"My Sister-in-law recommended this book to me. I'm a romance kind of girl and knowing this book was more mystery than romance, I wasn't chomping at the bit to get started on it. However, I trust her recommendations so start it I did. And I was immediately sucked in. I don't think there was a single likable character in the entire book. As for the main character, if there was a choice to be made she chose wrong - every time. The author captivated me with her method of story-telling and held my attention through to the very last page."
1758,Anje Hawkins,"I struggled with the first few chapters of this book. It pained me to read about a drunk Rachel. Initially I thought Megan lacked depth. Nevertheless, this book ended up being a cant-put-down read. Wow. What an ending. Do not read the last chapter first (for those of you who do that). Great book!!!!"
1759,Jeanne B. Moore,"Strangely enough, this is a classic ""who-done-it"" disguised as a novel. It was a great, quick read. Not quite as evil as ""Gone Girl,"" but that's a major plus in my opinion. "
1760,Jennie,"I have to start off by saying that I walk away from this book feeling down right depressed. I knew it was a thriller but the characters lives were just so depressing once you got to know them. Perhaps I just live in a world of sunshine and lollipops. =) However, I think the book was well thought out and artfully written. But I did figure out who the guilty part was early on which I'm rarely able to do. Perhaps it was just a lucky guess. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a creepy (think Sleeping with the Enemy) book. "
1761,Brooke,Overall I liked this book. It was a bit predictable at times but it was a good debut thriller from Paula Hawkins
1762,Paula Millhouse,"I loved this contemporary thriller so much more than some other current tales. We chose it for our Riverstone Book Club title for June. Once it got started and I oriented myself to the three POV characters, the story took off and I couldn't put it down.I discovered tons of deep internal issues between these three characters, Rachel, Anna, and Megan, that kept me guessing to the reveal at the end. I will say this - the way Hawkins tied up their loose ends made for a very satisfying read. Lots of heartbreak, suspense, and deep internal reflection about love, trust, and human interaction.Definitely a good read."
1763,Giorgia Wallworth,"I had such high expectations for this book after hearing the comparisons to Gone Girl (which is one of my favourite books and was what got me interested in the crime-thriller genre) and I have to say that it wasn't what I expected. While there are many similarities to Flynn's novel (the detestable narrators, missing wife, marital issues, pregnancy etc.) I feel that Hawkins did a great job of creating a unique world that was so real it was at times, confronting. While there were slow parts... I just couldn't put it down. I had to know what happened even though I was abhorred by the things that especially Rachel and Megan had done. The characterisation was what engaged me and I'm interested to see what else Hawkins has to offer. "
1764,Glosie Fernàndez,"A mi me gustó bastante el libro dentro de todo con sus intrigas, los conflictos psicológicos de los personajes y como los mismos hechos iban variando con cada capítulo...menos cuando Rachael se ponía en papel ""tengo un plan"" y terminaba haciendo todo lo contrario."
1765,Ashley,"At first, I was bored with the characters and considered them a bit one-dimensional. Then, I realized that I was becoming immune to books that presented characters in a real light. I’m talking like next store neighbor or Sally & Joe down the street! This story can leave an impression without including all of the flashiness or exaggeration. This story could have easily been an extension to anyone’s own life because it explores a few themes that may hit home for some people. All in all, I thought it was really good."
1766,Destiny Vieira,"The book, The Girl on The Train, by Paula Hawkins was very suspenseful. Megan Watson is an extreme alcoholic she hates that she is and she hates herself. She believes that she means nothing to anyone and finds herself very unattractive. She takes train from Ausbury,London to Euston,London every day for work. She passes many houses on the way to her work. One of which was her old house which her ex-husband and his wife live with their child now. But a few houses down from her old house, she notices a couple who sits on their porch every time she passes by their house. She sees them as a golden couple.Rachel starts to watch them every single day when she passes the house. Whenever she passes their house they're either being lovey dove you or being deep into a conversation with one another. She refers to them as Jess Jason but in reality their names are Megan and Scott. One day Megan goes missing Rachel might have the answers on why she went missing. But there are many people up for questioning. Who had the answers on where Megan was and if she was still alive. This book makes you realize that you can't even trust the people closest to you."
1767,KZM books," OVA RECENZIJA JE OBJAVLJENA NA PORTALU KNJIŽARA ZA MLADE.Naime, na početku knjige upoznajemo Rejčel, alkoholičarku, koja dane provodi vozeći se vozom. Svaki dan isti smer i pravac, svaki dan ista priča i svaki dan isti ljudi. Rejčel je nakon gubitka posla i razvoda potpuno izgubila osećaj za stvarnost i svoju tugu i nezadovoljstvo utapa u flaši. Putujući svaki dan vozom, ona prolazi istom ulicom u kojoj je nekada živela sa svojim suprugom, a pažnju joj najčešće privlači mladi bračni par koji živi nekoliko kuća dalje od njenog starog doma. U njima Rejčel vidi ono što je nekada ona bila i što je nekada imala sa svojim mužem Tomom. Džes i Džejson, kako ih je Rejčel nazvala, deluju kao savršen bračni par, sve dok jednog jutra dok je putovala vozom Rejčel ne ugleda drugog muškarca pokraj Džes. Nedugo zatim, Rejčel otkriva da je Džes – koja se zapravo zove Megan, nestala, a ona se nekako uvlači u istragu i pritom se povezuje i sa policijom i Meganinim mužem Skotom.Ova knjiga je pričana iz tri perspektive : Rejčel – alkoholičarke sa povremenim gubitkom sećanja, Megan – Skotove “savršene” žene i Ane – žene koja je zauzela Rejčelino mesto i preotela njenog muža Toma. Između alkoholičara, lažova i prevaranta, kome se može verovati?Devojka iz voza je definitivno jedna uzbudljiva i misteriozna knjiga u kojoj ćete uživati i potruditi se da je pročitate odmah nakon što je započnete. Svet koji je stvorila Pola Hokins je pun tajni, misterije i nečeg zbog čega ćete se povremeno naježiti i osetiti neverovatno uzbuđenje dok je budete čitali. Ova knjiga će vas oduševiti na mnogo načina, a kada je završite poželećete da svi čuju za nju."
1768,Cat,"Nop, I don't get the hype. I can understand that it has become a popular book, as it is fast-reading and quite entertaining, but it's just that. I could also see some similarities with 'Gone Girl', but it's not the same. Yes, here you also have that thing abound how looks can be deceiving and, as the story evolve, you start changing your opinion about the characters. And there is also a mystery. But that's it. So this story begins with Rachel, on her daily commute to London by train (we will later learn what all those train travels are about), thinking about her ruined life, the way her marriage ended, the next drink she's going to take. Everyday the train passes the same places and houses, stops at the same signal. Rachel likes to see the houses and daydream about a particular couple who seem to embody everything Rachel's marriage to Tom was not. They seem happy, they seem to be in love. What's there not to envy? Until one day, Rachel sees something out of the ordinary and starts thinking something is very wrong. And then a woman goes missing. And Rachel believes her disappearance is linked to what she saw. 'The Girl on the Train' his told by three female narrators: the alcoholic Rachel, Megan, a woman with many dark secrets on her past, and Anna, Rachel's substitute in marriage to Tom. As we read their narratives, how the story went from their perspective, we feel a shift in the way we feel about these women. I mean, Rachel was pretty obnoxious in the beginning, and for most part of the book, always making wrong decisions, and drinking to the point of passing out and not remembering anything the next day. I didn't really warm up to Rachel, but, at the end, I liked her a little bit more than I did in the beginning.Anna is not as innocent as we initially believe. She feels harassed by Rachel, as Rachel doesn't seem to know how to let go of Tom, but she has her share of guilty in the ending of Tom's previous marriage.As for Megan, I just found her tiresome. Her femme fatale ways were on the eye-rolling side. Then there are the men: Tom, Rachel's ex-husband and Anna's current husband, and Scott, Megan's husband. Without going into details, allow me to say that none of them is what they seem to be.And this five people are all connected. Between them and to the woman who disappears. And we will follow Rachel while she tries to understand everything that happened and is affecting her. With the insights from Megan and Anna, we manage to understand the whole story, which we wouldn't only by Rachel's point of view.But here's the thing: as we start knowing more about the characters, their pasts and secrets, the more obvious it becomes who the guilty one is. And when the revelation arrives, is not as mind-blowing as one would expect. Yes, the story is predictable.Still, as I said in the beginning, the story is fast-paced, very easy to read, entertains, there is mystery. It is a page-turner, I won't deny it. A rather predictable one, but still enjoyable enough for me to give it three stars and a half, round them up to four, and not feel guilty about it.I just don't really get the hype."
1769,Ana gc,"Es un libro que te cautiva , que te atrapa, que mantiene tu mente todo el tiempo pensando en qué pude pasar ... con personajes muy bien estructurados y un ritmo perfecto , en pocas palabras es un libro maravilloso , sin duda vale la pena leerlo."
1770,Ashlee,"Suspenseful and engagingCouldn't put this book down! Easy, suspenseful read and loved the Characters. Loved the twists in this book and how the author made you feel sympathy and dislike for each character."
1771,Robin,"This fast-paced psychological thriller captivated my attention from start to finish. Three women whose lives unintentionally intersect tell their stories in a series of not-always-chronological vignettes. The reader is privy to each woman’s journey of self-discovery, learning the happier and the grittier aspects of their personalities and life events. “Something bad happened,” as one of the women states, and slowly the revelations add up till the reader discovers what that was. And then the really scary stuff happens. Ms. Hawkins reveals each woman’s life in a way that makes the reader always want more. For me it was almost too suspenseful, but I enjoyed the characters very much. The ending was a complete surprise, even though I thought I had it figured out a couple of times.Readers who like suspenseful mysteries that get into people’s minds will enjoy this book. Those who want a fast, engrossing book will find it here. Anyone who enjoys reading about the more challenging aspects of women’s lives and relationships, or who has felt a little crazy when things that people tell them don’t quite feel right will be able to relate to this book."
1772,Jennifer Kyle,"4.5 Stars
”I’m connected. I am no longer just a girl on the train, going back and forth without point or purpose.”
This was a very exciting suspenseful read that kept a great pace and my attention till the very last line. The author tells the story through mainly Rachel’s pov along with some chapters of Megan and Anna’s povs. I was unable to but this book down till I finished and would definitely recommend friends who enjoyed books like Gone Girl to give it a go. Rachel is a flawed heroine who I just adored while the story keeps moving her drinking causes black outs and she inserts herself into a missing woman’s case that she may or may not be connected to. This is a story that readers should just go in blind and simply enjoy the ride. 
“One for sorrow, two for joy, three for a girl, four for a boy, five for silver, six for gold, seven for a secret never to be told. I’ve got a few of those…”

1773,The Baking Bookworm,"My Review: Normally I'm a little hesitant to jump wholeheartedly into a book that has so much acclaim so quickly. I'm always afraid that the book won't live up to my heightened expectations - which sadly is often the case. As an avid reader I've read a lot of suspense and I can't help that my mind is constantly trying to find little clues throughout the text so I can solve the crime sooner than the author wants it revealed. I'm a Sherlock Holmes wannabe. I had a hard time being the amateur sleuth this time because the author has written such complex characters, each with their own baggage and plausible motives that I kept changing my mind as to who was the culprit.Hawkins also kept my interest throughout (no small feat) with all of the red herrings that she threw at me. I admit that I guessed 'who dunnit' about three quarters of the way through but, that said, I also guessed a handful of people before that so I suppose my 'guess' wasn't 'right' per se as it was eventual.This book has been compared to Gone Girl and Before I Go To Sleep but I think that The Girl on the Train was a much better read than both of those books and that has a lot to do with the characters. The story is told from three points of view - Rachel, Megan and Anna. Each of these women have certain likable traits and many traits that were quite repellent and offensive. Normally if the main characters are totally unlikable (ie Gone Girl) I have a hard time getting behind them. I don't want to read about someone who has no redeeming qualities. That wasn't the case with this book. Hawkin's characters were very layered and defined even if some of their choices (namely Rachel's decision to keep her nose in things) were a little questionable/naive. But as you see what these women have lived through the reason for their choices becomes clearer.This book is a very impressive debut thriller with complex characters all with their own secrets to hide. It goes to show that you should never assume you know a person and also gives you the eerie feeling that you can't trust anyone. This was quite an addicting read. Hats off to Ms Hawkins for keeping my wandering mind solidly on her plot and interesting character choices. My Rating: 4/5 stars** This book review, as well as hundreds more, can also be found on my blog, The Baking Bookworm (www.thebakingbookworm.blogspot.ca) where I also share my favourite recipes. **"
1774,Melody Warnick,You know this was good because I had to tell my husband the whole plot afterwards.
1775,Sam,"
There’s nothing so painful, so corrosive, as suspicion.
This books is mind-blowing and insane. Psychopathic, to be precise.It tells the story of Rachel, an alcoholic, who doesn't seem to be able to get over her ex-husband, who is now enjoying his life with a beautiful wife and a pretty daughter. Their family seems perfect, which is completely the opposite of what Rachel is undergoing.But it doesn't stop just there, does it? There should be some plot twist, things that actually will draw the readers into the story. And yes, there is. Not just that, the twist is insane. Jess and Jason - the wonderful representation of perfection, or is that so? Megan and Scott? Rachel? Tom?This book features a tangled mess, which in fact is created beautifully. It drove me crazy as it started to unfold itself, and I could hardly stop reading. The mysteriousness when he and she were used instead of names left me hanging and unsatisfied, and that was actually what made the book extremely compelling and compulsive. 4.2 stars. I was not disappointed :) "
1776,nina salinger,"wow! Plot really did reach my expectations! Very interesting and it is a really good book. Must admit I was hiding the book under my books for college and was taking mini brakes so i can read it (I do that only with good books) Is it just me or do people guess from the start who the bad guy is. Was it that predictable? Maybe because i watch to many episodes of Criminal mind i am really good at guessing this;) Really liked how the author describe alcoholic problem which Rachel had, that constant desire for every sip of it.What I did not like was that here relationships are described less with emotions more with desire, I mean every relationship, Rach and Tom, Tom and Anna, Jess and Jason (lol). Maybe its just me but it kinda had lack romantic emotions. "
1777,ROSE,"Je ne suis pas une habituée du genre, alors j'aurais bien du mal à dire si c'est un bon polar ou non!Par contre, je peux dire que j'ai passé un excellent moment aux côtés avinés de Rachel et que je me suis laissée prendre au jeu de l'enquête. Il m'a manqué un soupçon de détails pour en faire un coup de cœur... Détails qui enroberaient l'ambiance et le cœur des personnages.Mais ce livre reste une jolie surprise!!"
1778,Kath,"I honestly didn't have any idea that The Girl on the Train was named as ""the next Gone Girl"". I read Gone Girl around September last year and I really enjoyed it even I was disappointed with the ending (my review here). Yes there are some similarities because I kept on thinking Gone Girl while reading TGOTT but believe me, this book is unique and twisted on its own way.The story was told from the POVs of three different women who you may or may not find likeable. If you'll ask me, I didn't like any of them (including the men) but I was symphatetic at times. I understand their reasons and most of them are unacceptable. Each one of the characters has their own flaws, unique personalities and deep secrets to tell. Kudos to the author for doing a great job on giving the characters their own voices. I was able to identify easily who is who.The writing style is compelling. A bit slow in the beginning but not in a way that you want to put it down. Just in case you did put it down, please pick it up and start again. I liked that the flashbacks and alternate POVs didn't confuse me. Also, I personally like reading books with first person POVs and written in journal type style so it's a plus for me. As for the mystery part, I didn't guess who the real culprit was. Not even on my top three. The big revelation towards the end made my heart beat fast. I didn't see that one coming.Not a perfect five because I have some questions or doubts about Rachel's blackout issues. Also, the last few pages were intense but felt a bit rushed for me and a little out of character. But all in all, I'm satisfied with the ending.This was an amazing novel. I highly recommend this book whether you liked Gone Girl or not. Like what I've said, The Girl on the Train is unique and twisted on its own way.No wonder why this book won the Best Mystery & Thriller in Goodreads Choice Awards 2015."

When friends judge constantly other people's failed marriages, I know they have a failed one too.So...If you really really knew what happens inside the privacy of the lives of everyone you know.. would it be wrong to say""I've met a killer?"".Quite a page turner, give it a read before it comes out as a film."
1782,Kate,"Fun. Not the NEW GONE GIRL that media seems to want it to be, and not necessarily worth the 661-person hold list at the library, but a definite page turner. I figured it out relatively early, but still enjoyed watching it unfold. Would I have read it in a day if I hadn't had the world's longest hair appointment during which to kill time? No one knows."
1783,Paulo Pires,"« Um imponente thriller, forte e encorpado pela fragilidade humana.Um jogo intenso e auspicioso entre a inevitabilidade e o suspense.Irremediavelmente um best-seller.»« O livro conta a história de três mulheres cujas vidas se entrelaçam, se afectam e partilham muitas mais afinadas do que à partida possa parecer.É uma história forte, com uma voz possante, repleta de personalidade e cheia de simbologia. Faz-se acompanhar de personagens credíveis e cruas, o que as reveste de uma proximidade interessante e atractiva para quem lê.O livro é-nos apresentado pela voz de três personagens Rachel, Megan e Anna, cabendo a Rachel ser o fio condutor desta intrincada história. Cabe a ela também unir todas as outras personagens, cabe a ela ser a chave para o mistério que se adensa em cada nova cena.Gostei simbologia atribuída ao comboio, a sua recorrência que lembra os ciclos da vida e a sua propensão para repetir o caminho trilhado como se de um percurso previamente definido se trata-se. O paralelismo da passividade com que nos entregamos e aceitamos o que nos é imposto. Uma entrega despojada de ambição a uma rotina que se enceta a cada novo dia nas nossas vidas. A passividade desconcertante a que nos confinamos e nos acomodamos.A autora joga com a imaginação do leitor, aproveitando os lugares comuns da fragilidade humana para encontrar a ligação com o leitor. Utiliza um forte e inteligente mecanismo de conexão: as emoções.Qual de nós não se perdeu em pensamentos num ou noutro momento e conscientemente (ou inconscientemente) não ficcionou sobre a vida de um estranho? Faz parte da natureza humana(!), é assim que nós criamos (ou não) empatia por alguém que não conhecemos, com quem nem sequer falamos! É algo que ultrapassa o racional, algo primário que se baseia nos nossos instintos! Tendemos a estabelecer relações entre as nossa vivência, entre ""o que"" e ""quem"" conhecemos, e com base em alguma semelhança física, de atitude, de postura, do timbre de voz, de um gesto, de uma reacção, criarmos uma pretensa imagem de alguém. E esta é a ideia que é apresentada ao leitor, um começo (""Hook"") forte e apelativo que à partida apresenta mais perguntas do que respostas, como convém.Quanto aos mecanismos usados: a autora aproveita muito bem as limitações que providenciam as visões de vários narradores, as suas naturais limitações, a sua subjectividade, como é o caso do problema com a bebida e as repetidas perdas de memória de Rachel.As personagens são apelativas. Conseguimos subtrair simbolicamente traços comuns nos géneros! O sexo feminino apresenta-se frágil, permissivo, por vezes submisso e por oposição com rasgos de insuspeita energia e insurgência que as fazem emergir e opor-se, transformando as suas fraquezas em forças.

1784,Merril Anil," so this is why everybody is talking about it I picked up this book because it has been doing pretty good in book gossip columns and must read sections for past few months. Everywhere i turn there was news of this book or somebody's update about reading it or wanting to read it. So i finally boarded this train that everybody was talking about. After reading the book i am kind of in the middle of agreeing with all these appreciations and not being that impressed too.The book from the get go is pure content based. Everything that is good to the book is basically because of the strong content added and enhanced by equally powerful characters. Each character in the book is strongly inclined to give you sleepless nights.The whole book has a very dark and melancholic ambiance to it. It is sad. The plight of each characters is sad so be prepared to be swarmed by a tsunami of cold, dark emotionsThe only point where the book failed to make a mark on me was at its narration. It is kind of choppy and not smooth to ease you into the book. it keeps breaking in between but once you get to the depth of the story you can hardly notice as you start getting immersed with the lives of these characters mentioned in the book. Language is good and sharp. characters and basic plot powerful and interesting. Definitely serves up on high quotient of thriller making it a good read after you get attached to the core of the bookIf you haven't heard yet then let me enlighten you that the book is already a NYT bestseller and it is being converted to a movie pretty soon and that should say something about the book.. right? The book is high on rich characters and they make this book shine. Each characters even in passing stirs you pretty good. The book does not go into unnecessary details and stick to the direct path of the core plot. The narration is where i had trouble because it is kind of dwindling in and out of events and places. The whole book is sombre and you need to be prepared for the sad and grey sky hovering over the book but all in all it does justify the hype it has been collecting because at the end of the day it was a good thrilling read for me. "
1785,Lisa Jablonsky,"I had to see what the hype was all about, and was given the book by the publisher, but I did not read any reviews prior to reading other than 'It's the next Gone Girl"". It's a good thriller/suspense, and better than Gone Girl, and it's more than that. It deals with alcoholism, infidelity, infertility, trust and self-worth issues. I can see these being hot buttons for many women while reading. Most will feel better about themselves and their situations after reading this book. ALL the main characters range from hot mess to despicable. I usually find it challenging to read a book when there's no one to root for, but I was sucked in fast and very much wanted to find out who done it and powered through. There were a number of twists that i did see coming, but not so far in advance. Read it in one weekend, which says a lot, for me. "
1786,Kate (Lillytales),"Paula Hawkins' psychological thriller, 'The Girl on the Train' has received a significant amount of praise since its release in January. I definitely feel like this work of fiction lives up to the hype! The mystery begins with Rachel, a divorced, alcohol-dependent PR consultant who catches the same train to London every day. The train route travels past a set of suburban houses, where Rachel fantasizes about the lives being led within. One day she witnesses an event along the train line and it changes her course in life forever.Due to Rachel's issues with alcohol abuse, we as the reader deal with a really unreliable narrator as we become increasingly skeptical and unsure whether her version of events are correct.I won't say any more for fear of spoiling the ending; although I will say that this book is full of intrigue, suspense and had me on the edge of my seat! A very enjoyable work of mystery within the crime/thriller genre, well done Paula Hawkins! "
1787,Fred Forbes,"While Rachel is not the most sympathetic protagonist (drunks usually aren't) her story is a fascinating one. Interesting approach in this book to weave the viewpoints together of the major participants. Lots of false leads, red herrings, and the self centered perspectives that people often have combine for an interesting mystery and a fascinating read. "
1788,Thorne Moore,"I was the woman on the train reading The Girl On The Train, all the way from Rochester to Carmarthen, and it certainly kept me occupied. So occupied I entirely failed to notice the Severn Tunnel. Certainly no complaints about the pace, and if you want an in-depth autopsy of the condition of alcoholism, this spares nothing, and left me determined to be a teetotaller – maybe tomorrow.I liked the language, the setting, the idea of using fantasised lives seen from a train – I’ve been doing that for years. What I found harder to like were the characters, or more specifically, the women. I did sympathise with Rachel, but I craved for a glimpse of a woman, somewhere in there, whose dreams and schemes weren’t focussed entirely on beg, borrow or stealing the man she wants. There are some women in the world with a bit more creative purpose and self-respect. Just one would do – although the charitable act of sisterly togetherness at the end almost redressed the balance for me. "
1789,Wendy,"There are no sympathetic characters in this book. But the story is so surprising and well conceived, it matters less that every character in the book is a screw up. Well worth reading. "
1790,Jen Hayes,"The Girl on the Train is a fun read, but I'm not exactly sure why. It seems a bit plodding for the first 80% of the book, but I was compelled to keep reading, waking in the middle of the night with thoughts of the story swirling around in my head. The writing is, in my opinion, immature and un-remarkable, and the story is a predictable 'who-dunnit'. I don't read many mystery-thriller type books, but I figured out the 'who-dunnit' several chapters before the writer revealed it, which was almost disappointing! I generally like to read fairly slowly, making sure I absorb every word the author chose to use in a novel, but with this book I found myself skipping sentences and skimming parts of paragraphs. I give the book 3-1/2 stars(rounding up to 4), because it was still fun to read, but if you wondering if you should read another book on your 'To-read' list first, go ahead and put this one at a lower priority - it does not leave you with any gems of beauty, emotion or thought after you've read it."
1791,Saloni,REVIEW TO COME
1792,Sonja Arlow,"I really need to read more thrillers, as I am the perfect target market. I am slightly clueless at figuring out who is the culprit (only at the 70% mark did I figure out who’s who in this book) and this means that I get completely swept up in the suspense.This book is constantly compared to Gone Girl, and while there are similarities I enjoyed Girl on the Train so much more. I wont go into detail about the storyline because I think it has been reviewed enough times but would like comment on the 3 main characters.Rachel - She's an alcoholic, she's lost her job and obsesses over Tom, her ex. Sometimes she drinks to the point of blacking out and this makes her an unreliable narrator. I really felt sorry for her and my sympathies were reserved mostly just for her.Megan - It is clear early on that she is even more mentally unstable than Rachel and the more I read about her the less I liked her. Enough said.Anna - I struggled to really get a feel for Anna and her character came across as flat and a bit shallow and I have to admit that at times I relished in feelings of schadenfreude at Anna’s insecurities about her marriage. The men in the story never felt as well crafted as the women but I thought they were still woven in well enough without coming across as only bit players.This is a VERY impressive debut novel worth all the hype that surrounds it. If you're not afraid of imperfect characters struggling with depression, loneliness, rejection, addiction, infidelity and dishonesty all wound into a pretty intriguing murder mystery, then give this book a try."
1793,Susan Visser,"It's hard to believe that this is the author's first book! She nailed it! It was impossible to put down and had a very unique premise. Deeply flawed characters and unexpected connections. For anyone who liked Gone Girl or other Gillian Flynn books, you'll devour this one!"
1794,Love Fool,"If I could, I would rate this book a 4.5Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning. She sees something shocking. It’s only a minute until the train moves on, but it’s enough. Now everything’s changed. Unable to keep it to herself, Rachel offers what she knows to the police, and becomes inextricably entwined in what happens next, as well as in the lives of everyone involved. Has she done more harm than good?I thought this book was very good, suspenseful, and a real page-turner. Rachel is annoying with her drinking and I wanted to shake her to stop but I never had a problem with drinking so maybe I don't understand (now fatty foods I understand). Paula Hawkins does a very good job with making you second guess everything and everyone. In one chapter you think you figured out the mystery and then boom, she throws something at you and you guess something else. If you like mysteries then I would suggest reading this. "

"
1796,İlkim,"Öncelikle bana Uyuyana Kadar kitabını hatırlattığını söylemem gerek. Ayrıca kitaptaki mind-fuck iyiydi, tahmin edilebilir olsa da. Olay Rachel'ın sürekli bindiği trende gözünü koyduğu bir evdeki çifte takmasıyla başlıyor ve arkasından gelenler tam bir karmaşa. İlişkiler, yalanlar, acılar... Ama kitabın bir yerinde neyin ne olduğunu hafiften çakmaya başlıyorsunuz orası kesin. Buna rağmen iyiydi, elimden bırakamadım bir türlü. "
1797,Coreen,"Several people recommended this book to me, and I understand why. It is a page-turner. I didn't figure it out until a key piece of evidence is given near the end, then I slapped my hand to my forehead and said, well, duh!The most interesting aspect of this book is the author's choice to create a large cast of unlikable characters. None of them are particularly likeable, none. And even in the end, none are very redeemed. But it works.Possible spoilers.....I had issues with a few loose ends not being tied up, like who leaked the info from Megan's past (was it the doc trying to get himself out of the spotlight?) and the phone they found in Megan's pocket...did she have two on her that night? The police mentioned she had one in her pocket, but how did the other end up in the gym bag? Why did the killer only take the one? I also would have liked the police, especially the bitchy one Riley, to have made amends but as I said, none of the characters were likable (except the baby) and none were redeemed. I don't think for a second Anna helped Rachel out of the goodness in her heart or because it was the right thing to do...no, that was all self-preservation.But it was a good read and I enjoyed it!"
1798,Linda Baker,"The Girl on the Train debuted at the top of the NYT list, something almost unheard of for a first book. Necessarily that called for a lot of pre publication hype and the usual comparisons to Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl. I have never read Gone Girl and generally avoid books so extensively hyped. In the case of The Girl on the Train though, I found the book's premise almost irresistible. Rachel commutes to London daily and has taken to watching a couple who live in a house close to the tracks. They appear to have an idyllic life and Rachel dubs them ""Jess and Jason"". One day Rachel sees something quite shocking from the train and hears the next day that ""Jess"", actually named Megan, is missing. Rachel feels that she must tell the police what she saw. But if she does will she do more harm than good?Told in the alternating voices of Rachel, Megan and the new wife of Rachel's ex, Anna, The Girl on the Train kept me riveted throughout. That is no small feat considering that each narrator is not only entirely unreliable but also entirely unlikable. Rachel is an alcoholic who has let everything in her life go after the break-up of her marriage. She lives in a fantasy land and is making no attempt to straighten herself out. I did have a little sympathy for her but none for Megan or Anna. The Girl on the Train is a gem of plotting and a twisted tale that will keep you guessing from beginning to end.I recommend The Girl on the Train highly!RATING- 4.5 Stars"
1799,Amal Bedhyefi,"I don't know what to think about this book .It's about a girl named Rachel who catches the same commuter train Every morning . She knows it will wait at the same signal each time , overlooking a row of back gardens . She's even started to feel like she knows the people who live in one of the houses 'Jess &Jason ' she calls them.UNTIL she sees smth shocking , and everything changed now she has a chance to become a part of the lives she's only watched from afar.This book has been UPS ans downs to me , there are some pages that i really admired and others i couldn't help but skipping them.Overall , its amazing , the story is well written , you can see it through 3 different perspectives which is absolutely amazing and at the same time tiring ( you need full concentration).I loved the description , characters ,the suspense , the places , the emotions and most importantly the twist.Cant wait till the movie comes out .Rating : 4/5 stars."
1800,Gaïdic,"C'est une histoire très poignante avec un déroulement assez inattendu. Ça change beaucoup des policiers que j'ai l'habitude de lire. Les personnages sont tous bien développés. Rachel est particulièrement complexe : on a envie de la secouer, mais on est triste pour elle mais en même temps elle est souvent insupportable ! C'est assez étrange. J'ai eu du mal à rentrer dans l'histoire, la faute à la période des fêtes et du peu de temps que je disposais pour lire. Je suis persuadée que si j'avais été plus dispo, je l'aurai lu en quelques jours ! En bref, un très bon roman bien ficelé !"
1801,Dianna,"A physiological thriller that once you start reading, you can't put down! At first I wasn't so keen on her writing style. But a dozen or so pages into it I forgot all about that I was so pulled into the story. So many twists and turns! I highly recommend this one!!! 4.5 stars! "
1802,Tracey Allen at Carpe Librum,"The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins was released last week and is already being called 'the next Gone Girl by many reviewers. Rachel catches the same train into London each day and enjoys looking at the houses that go by and imagining the lives of those inside. One day, she sees something that will set an entire chain of events rolling which steadily build to a thrilling climax.I can understand why early readers of The Girl on the Train are comparing it to Gone Girl, as it contains first person perspective from - in this case, several - female characters and is a thriller with a cracking pace. I enjoyed the flawed characters and the urban tension was palpable.I groaned out loud at certain peak points in the novel when characters behaved against my advice (don't you hate that?) and didn't see any of the events coming. I also didn't work out 'whodunnit' either, which makes for an entertaining read.The Girl on the Train is an impressive debut and I very much look forward to watching this author in the future."
1803,m. ulinnuha,"Udah lama nggak baca thriller yang bisa bikin begadang saking penasarannya.Walaupun, seperti kata orang-orang, Rachel ini narator yang nggak reliable, tapi narasinya berhasil bikin saya pengin cepet-cepet tahu siapa dalang sebenarnya.4 bintang."
1804,Dianne,"Looks like this is going to be the ""Gone Girl"" of 2015....it's gone totally viral, Amazon has gone out of stock at least once, lots of book clubs are reading it, wait-lists are hundreds of people deep at the libraries....so, is it worthy of all the hype?Yes - it's certainly not a great piece of literature, but it's an extremely addictive ""popcorn thriller"" - perfect for a beach or vacation read. Several of us read this as part of a book club buddy read and many of us finished it in a couple of days. It's an easy read and hard to put down!I won't recount the plot or give anything away. I would recommend that you stay away from reviews; the less you know going in, the better. It will keep you guessing for sure.Read it and enjoy! Fun. "
1805,Cindy Price,This book reminded me of GONE GIRL but way better.
1806,Eszter,"The story is very mysterious and exciting, but everyone in the story is terrible, and the whole story is abnormal and brutal. It is sad, that the people want to read so sad and depressive stories. But the style of the novel is good, you must read it to the end, and every time think about the possible solutions. "
1807,Brenda Suarez ,"¡Pero que buen libro joder! Personalmente pienso que si un libro te logra transmitir emociones y sentimientos tan intensos como desesperación, miedo, depresión, soledad y angustia entonces es un buen libro. La chica del tren es un libro buenísimo que consiguió todo eso y más. Empezando por las tres mujeres que narran la historia, he de decir que, ¡eran un completo desastre! Eran terribles, me causaban tanta lastima y pena y yo ya ni sabia en que confiar, Paula Hawkins hizo un desastre con mi cabeza, en verdad que si. Y la manera de escribir de esta mujer hizo que no quisiera parar de leer en ningún momento, desde las primeras páginas me absorbió dentro de la trama y no me soltó hasta el final. Llego un momento en el que todos parecían culpables y yo empece a sospechar de medio mundo, pero entonces viene el plot twist y ¡boom! Todo encaja. Aunque, siento que el desarrollo del final estuvo un poco suelto y no tuvo la intensidad que yo esperaba, de todos modos disfruté y también sufrí con esta lectura, además que fue la primera que leí en este genero... Reto de lectura 2015 #10 Un thriller de misterio.  "
1808,Zoë Arabella,"I just want to say that this book has helped me become a more empathetic person. I am grateful for this view into the minds of people I otherwise might've misjudged or overlooked. While it is a compelling thriller, this empathetic characterization is what really makes it. "
1809,Veronica ,"Finally got to read this to see what the fuss was all about. I get it its pretty ""edge of your seat"" kinda of story. I think by now every know that it's about Rachel, who is a alcoholic, who creeps on this couple for a window of her train everyday on her commute. She is a very unreliable source as you begin to see with the unraveling of this story. Something happens with the couple she is creeping on & she starts to get involved to solve what happened. I don't want to give out more because I feel if I do it might spoil it. I felt it was a solid 4 because it kept my page turning till I was done. the only thing is I felt wanting more from the ending but I totally would recommend this to others, it was a intriguing read!! "
1810,Miguel,"http://silenciosquefalam.blogspot.pt/...(...)Até onde a mente perturbada de uma mulher abandonada e traída pode chegar? Será que conhecemos totalmente a pessoa com quem partilhamos a vida? Como reconhecer os traços de personalidade de um mentiroso compulsivo? Que segredos escondem a última pessoa que nos dirigiu a palavra ou o olhar? Eis algumas questões que A Rapariga no Comboio pode despoletar no leitor, quando todas as páginas terem sido lidas e finalmente reveladas todas as ocultações de factos e acções que, através das vozes narradoras deste romance psicológico, Paula Hawkins nos fez acreditar, para também nos pôr à prova, revelando assim o seu jogo de mestria na arte de compor uma história inteligentemente bem delineada, com enredos com voltas e reviravoltas.(...)"
1811,Alexis,"4.5 stars. I really enjoyed this book. It was slow at times, but over all I finished it in a day and could not put it down. I'm not giving it 5 stars because I was expecting a bigger twist, and the characters were so unlikable. I would recommend this to anyone who likes psychological thrillers, but I definitely prefer Gillian Flynn's novels. "
1812,Karen Powell,"Though I've read many comparisons to ""Gone Girl"" in reviews out there, I think it's only true as far as both present the narrative voice of an unlikable woman. A more accurate comparison would be to the work of Alfred Hitchcock, especially with the train motif and a growing feeling of dread and suspense up to the climax. Alcoholic Rachel is riding out her downward spiral on the train every weekday morning and evening, passing by the street where she used to live with her ex-husand, who still resides there with his new wife and child. To distract her from this, Rachel has fixated on a husband-and-wife couple a few doors up who seem to embody all that she an her ex Tom used to have. When Rachel sees something off the day the wife goes missing, she gets herself tangled up in the investigation.The narrative is quick and thrilling and presents the viewpoints of three women, all of them highly flawed and unlikable, but not in a way that should prevent enjoyment of the novel. The darkness in each woman has its reasons even if we don't agree with them nor would we necessarily make their choices. We have an alcoholic day-drinking herself into oblivion to drive away the shame of actions done during yet another blackout, a mistress-turned-wife unrepentant of her actions, and a woman broken from grief caused by her own doing. The unifying factor between these women is that we cannot judge a person based upon what we see, for underlying factors run deep and can remain hidden from even those who live with each other. "
1813,Anita,"4.5 Bought during a vacation in Puerto Rico and kept unread much too long.  There's a lot to be said for the reason this novel is a thriller and a mystery. The chapters, plot, and conflicts (as there are multiple conflicts) made it extremely hard for me to accomplish life outside of reading this novel. A main point is that two of the narrators are unreliable for several reasons, and the novel relies on their unreliability as a plot device.  The novel's characters all have secrets which are uncovered through the characters' narratives. I honestly believe that the characters kept some secrets concealed, because I was left with questions even after my reading. The book's main narrator, Rachel, is an alcoholic who has lost nearly everything important in her life: her sobriety, marriage, house, job, and financial freedom. The novel's other narrator, Megan, is unreliable due to PTSD due to a tragedy during her drug-addled youthful indiscretions with a drifter in the English countryside. Megan reinvents herself when she marries Scott Hipwell and settles into a middle-class life in Witley, a London suburb just along the railroad tracks.  Rachel and Megan's lives become intertwined when Rachel believes she was the last to see Megan alive the night she was murdered. Unfortunately, Rachel was on a night-long bender and has blocked out the events. The novel follows her attempts to remember by retracing her steps. A second unfortunate point for Rachel is that her ex-husband, Tom, and Megan live on the same street. Rachel's co-dependancy on Tom to help her through daily life creates major conflict in the plot and as she becomes more involved in the murder mystery, their relationship becomes even more strained. I thought it very odd that ex-spouses would interact the way they did, and made me believe that Tom honestly enjoyed watching his ex-wife suffer and for him to be the hero of her life, while not totally involved in her day-to-day struggles. Tom's wife, Anna, is a Stepford wife-witch of a woman, who feels Rachel invades her life just as she attempts to establish a family life with a new daughter. (I won't share how Anna and Tom came to be together, because it would affect a future reader's feelings).  I was surprised when the killer's identity was finally revealed and I am still turning possible thoughts as to where in the characters' stories the author left hints that I glossed over while reading. The author adds a final twist at the end which was truly shocking. I was surprised this was the author's debut because it was a page-turner for me. The author does a wonderful job of unravelling the women's lives to the reader, and showing that a passing appearances are often wrong."
1814,Elena Latici,"Enough Red Herrings For A Swedish smorgasbord.Rachel cannot get over the pain of losing her husband Tom to another woman, Anna. Every morning when she goes to work on the train and every evening she passes by the Victorian home she once shared with Tom. Her pain is palpable and excruciating to this reader anyway. Anyone who has experienced that level of betrayal will be moved by Rachel's pain as she watches Anna not just living in her old home, but with all of its furnishings and decoration all put together with such love and joy, such happiness in her safe, warm marriage with Tom. Their only disappointment was their inability to conceive the child Rachel so desperately wanted. They try IVF, but it fails and Tom says he hasn't the money for another round. This is the beginning of Rachel's slide in deep depression that she self medicates with liquor, finally becoming a full blown alcoholic. Her pain becomes ever more acute as one morning from the train she sees Anna, belly busting with the result of her fecundity. She is watering Rachel's roses. Rachel isn't actually going to work on the train. She was fired three months previously for returning drunk from a three hour lunch during which she grossly treated and subsequently lost a client. But she rides the train anyway to mms make her friend and roommate, Cathy, believe she has a job. A few door down from her old home there is another house, identical to Rachel's. A young couple live there. He is strong and protective; she is ethereal,, elegant and blonde. Rachel names them Jason and Jess and constructs a rich, imaginative and blissful marriage for them.Rachel drinks so heavily that she has blackouts. Not losing consciousness, but while chunks of time that are completely lost to her, of which she has no memory at all. But something about the tunnel beneath the train tracks brings up feelings of dread and fear. Something bad happened here, thinks Rachel.Meanwhile Rachel continues to bother Tom with drunken, tearful phone calls and even goes to seek him out at their old home, which she still thinks of as hers. Tom tries his best gently to make her go away, take care of herself, go to AA, but Rachel's calls and visits continue until finally the police are brought into the matter.Meanwhile, Jess has gone missing. Only Jess is actually Megan and Jason, her husband, is Scott. Rachel takes it upon herself to play detective leading her to discover to the near loss of her life, the horrifying identity of the killer."
1815,Betty Strohecker,"The Girl on the Train is Rachel Watson, who takes the same train daily from the suburbs into London. Stopping at the same signal along a stretch of suburban homes, Rachel has a first hand look into the life of a couple as they drink coffee on their terrace. She becomes fascinated with them and their 'perfect' life to the point of giving them names, Jess and Jason, and imagining more about their lives than the daily snippets she is able to view. One of the reasons Rachel is so engrossed is because two years ago she lived in the same row of homes several doors down, until her seemingly wonderful life fell apart. She can't help but imagine that Jess and Jason are living the life she once adored. But one day she sees something shocking on her daily ride that turns her life upside down.This story is told over a period of four months, with brief flashbacks to a year before. It is written in the form of dated reflections beginning with the main character, Rachel, but quickly adding thoughts from two other women, Megan and Anna. Interspersed through each character's thoughts are details of their past, bringing them to the present day. This is definitely a psychological drama and thriller. I would recommend readers set aside a good block of time to begin this book because it can be somewhat confusing until all of he characters are introduced. I didn't do this and found myself rereading to get names and dates in proper focus. After that, it was hard for me to put this book down. I felt compelled to find out the ending. I would recommend this to all readers who enjoy a thrilling drama allowing the reader to journey through the minds of its characters."
1816,Helen King,"A great page turner, and I enjoyed the revelations as they happened. Interesting to read Rachel's awareness increasing as she searched and kept searching for the answers to what had happened, and what she had seen, and the adjustments to what she understood to be true. Paula Hawkins captures the voices of the main characters well, I thought (possibly the two main male characters were a bit too similar, but that's the only quibble), and it was fairly plausible too (and very evocative of London - I love the sense of place that I gained from the novel)The story contains enough tension and complexity to remain interesting, without being overly complex. Unlike some thriller type books, not all the characters are not horrible either, so I wasn't left thinking I didn't care what happened really (say, as I did in Gone Girl) - I was hoping for some resolutions. And in that sense, the ending wrapped things up well, without being too neat. A satisfying read. "
1817,Stefanie,"This book is all about lies. Are they good, or are they inherently bad? Is it okay to lie if you are doing it for someone else's benefit, and wrong if it is for your own? What if you are in danger?Maybe you aren't lying enough.Rachel witnesses something from her vantage point on the 8:04 train to London and becomes embroiled in a mystery that she has no place to be solving. What follows is an agonizing thriller that takes place in the corners of a drunken blacked out mind and in the sinister smiles of potential criminals. Read this, but make sure you have time to read it in one sitting."
1818,Juliana,"Livro com boa trama mas o que mais me chamou a atenção foi a temática da violência doméstica e como as vítimas muitas vezes se sentem culpadas pelo discursos de ""proteção"" do agressor.Questões sociais colocadas no livro sem pieguice e de maneira adequada. Personagens bem construídos mas acredito que a linguagem cinematográfica comprometeu a linguagem literária. Nitidamente o livro já nasceu roteiro de um filme. "
1819,Kate Hearn,"I received this book in a good reads giveaway.I'll admit, I actually couldn't figure this one out. I was a little surprised by the end and who had done what. I started this book on Saturday afternoon, and finished it Sunday morning. It was a quick, but intense read. I highly enjoyed this one, though I wanted to smack some of the characters...Rachel included as some of the things she did, you just knew were going to lead to trouble"
1820,Kat Steiner,"Compelling thriller - read it almost in one sitting. Very much in the vein of Gone Girl (I'm sure Hawkins is fed up with hearing that) - first-person narratives, diaries moving backwards and forwards around the event, lots of red herrings.I was maybe a bit disappointed with the final reveal, but thrillers are so often like that - it's easier to write build up than satisfactorily deliver on it. And it was one of the very few books where I've been put off by the unlikeable characters - I hardly ever notice that, but I just couldn't stand Anna. Rachel & Megan I was fine with, and they were the main narrators, so it didn't really matter.The characters were a bit forgettable generally; I found it hard to tell them apart, to be honest. Probably because they were all first-person, but the writing style didn't change enough to be really recognisable I suppose. Not going to win any prizes for great literary style, but deserves a lot of the hype for a great thriller. Left me a bit negative about relationships, though. Not a happy Christmas read, but definitely good for airports and, of course, trains."

1822,Haneen,"I loved the narration for this book! Each character had a different actress and they performed their roles well. The print book had a lot of holds at the library and when I looked through the other formats, the audiobook had a copy available for checkout. A well-written, suspenseful story with interesting characters and similar themes running through (marriage and children). I didn't really expect the conclusion, which made it a good mystery. I absorbed the book better as I listened to it and am not sure if I would have had the same level of comprehension if I read it. Though I did get a bit confused with the dates and the flashbacks. Overall, I would recommend this title. "
1823,Melanie A,"I would have given it 5 stars, but it started off slow for me. I love the ride this book took me through!"
1824,Mary:),"Actually 3.7/5 starsI loved the psychoanalysis in this book. Every character was morally ambiguous, obsessed with something and really flawed. They all had their own problems, their own sins and their own troubled pasts to chase them. I love characters with troubled pasts and morally ambiguous characters so I just got really attached to this part of the book. The main character was the exact opposite of a detective. She was an alcoholic, fat and antisocial, who had a very vivid imagination but for some reason, she was really open minded and when her memory was helping her, she could realize things in seconds. I actually came to like her but also pity her a lot, not only because nobody liked her and because everybody was unfair to her but because she destroyed her life in a very bad way.Another thing that is worth mentioning is that this book made me understand better the whole theory that alcoholism is as bad as drug addiction. Rachel's life as an alcoholic was poor, she couldn't even take care of herself, she had a very bad memory loss she repelled everybody. When she was sober, though, she was clever and persistent and this by itself proves how harmful alcohol can be.The thing that made me decide to rate this book with 3.7 stars was the mysery/thriller aspect/ murder. It may be that I don't understand exactly the meaning of Psychological Thriller. It's supposed to be a thriller with morally ambiguous characters and complex psychological aspects (which was really good in this book) but also it should be able to create psychological horror and make you unable to sleep because you want to see what happened. Unfortunately, this did not affect me at all. Not only I didn't feel connected to the mystery the story had but I also found the killer before it was revealed who he was (note that my friends were surprised about that).I just felt that some fantasy/ YA books I read had more action and mystery than that. But as I said, I probably just don't understand the whole Psychological Thriller genre that much Idk if I should recommend it, do what you want. The writing is addictive though, so you may like it:)~Mary"
1825,Jacquie,"Oh, wow. It's hard to give a dark book 4 stars, but it kept me riveted from the start. It was my spring break read and did not disappoint. I read this faster than I have read a book in a long time. It's been compared to Gone Girl and I think I liked that one better in the end because there were times in this book when I thought, ok, get on with it. After reading this, I needed a drink! Need to find an uplifting book to follow this one. "
1826,Rekha,"I get the comparisons to Gone Girl but to me Gone Girl had several psychos that you had to deal with all at the same time which made the whole thing feel crazy-- this one is more eerie and the pacing was totally different. The main thing that the two have in common is the dark view of the marriages involved- the dysfunction upon dysfunction in both were similar. The thing I liked best about this was the unreliable narrator stuff. I didn't get into the baby/pregnancy obsession stuff, but that's just not my deal."
1827,Allie Winjum,"The cadence and the voice were quite similar to Gillian Flynn's ""Gone Girl"", as well as the type of mystery having a similar feel, however, I loved it! I flew through the crazy mystery and the sharp twists and turns of the plot held my attention throughout. The story will shock you and keep you intrigued up until the finale. I truly recommend this book for those who want a fairly easy, however suspenseful, read."
1828,Liz Nix,"Hmmm...It's been a while since I have finished this one, and after this amount of time, I feel like I would take it down to 3 stars. However, what's done is done. This was such a quick read (or listen in my case). I couldn't wait to figure out what was going on. I really don't think mysteries are my thing though. I always read through them so fast and then I am very disappointed to know the ending. I like the mystery. I hate that everything gets wrapped up so nicely in the end. That's not necessarily the book's fault though, that's just me. My favorite part of this book was everybody else's least favorite part. I LOVED the characters in this book. They were terribly flawed and kind of a train wreck to read about, but I also felt like they were realistic people and I felt a good deal of sympathy (empathy?) for them. People often complain about characters in a book being terrible, but guess what, people are terrible. Overall, a good quick read although I don't know if it will go down in history as being amazingly well-written. This is definitely one I would recommend to my friends who don't read quite as often. PS-I also didn't find this one to be a great book club read. There really wasn't that many ideas to discuss. "
1829,Say Lee,"Now this is what I call a Mystery book!One that keeps you on the edge of your seat from page 1, makes you bite your nails down to stubs and makes you wish you could pull an all-nighter just to solve the mystery.If it comes with a dose of unreliable narrators who make you want to pull all of your hair out, what can I say?Added Bonus!The Girl on the Train is everything the reviewers are raving about and a lot more."
1830,Carin,"There's been a lot of comparisons of The Girl on the Train to Gone Girl, and I can sort of see why--they're both thrillers with female protagonists and unreliable narrators--but the parallels are pretty thin. I for one liked it better than Gone Girl. I found it more suspenseful, more emotional, and I liked the unreliable narrators here more (there are three narrators). I felt that they were unreliable in a normal way, like how all of us misremember things, have a slightly different perspective on an incident than the other people involved, rather than being manipulative. True, one narrator is omitting an important detail, without which the book would have been half as long and not suspenseful, but I think an omission is different than a lie. For that matter, I think it was the author, not the narrator, omitting that. That narrator certainly knew who she was talking about, even if we readers didn't.So every day on her way to work, Rachel's train stops at this one spot on the tracks where Rachel can see into the backyard and kitchen of a particular house. The couple she sees there seem ideal to her--happy, loving, fun. She imagines what their lives must be like--so different from hers. She's divorced, heavily drinking, and actually not really going to work but instead going to wander around London for eight hours so her roommate won't find out she's been fired. Then one day Rachel sees something she shouldn't. And the next day, the wife is missing. She needs to tell someone, but who, and how can she get them to believe her? She gets pulled into the mystery, and it gets much more complicated than she had imagined.I found the suspense that Ms. Hawkins creates so subtle and skillful that at times I almost didn't want to keep reading, because I was so worried about what would happen to Rachel. But I also was compelled to keep going. I found the depiction of someone in active alcoholism very fascinating, along with the requisite memory gaps. Rachel managed both to have mostly created her own misery, and yet be sympathetic. The three narrative characters were very interestingly drawn, three-dimensional characters, who often looked very different from the other narrator's perspectives. The alternating point of view I found very effective here. Not only did it allow for showing us scenes where the main character wasn't there, but it showed how Rachel (and the others) look to outsiders, how our internal view of ourselves conflicts with how others see us, and how it's so much easier to empathize when you know a person's history. So it an action-packed thrilled, but also a deep study in psychology and messed up people. An excellent escape when you need a distraction, but not fluffy or silly. It's a fast and fun read."
1831,Thuong Le,"There has been on much hype surrounding the Girl on the Train; named the next Gone Girl, it has been the most anticipated book of January 2015 and topping the number one New York Bestseller. I read Gone Girl this year, which I really enjoyed, so I knew the Girl on the Train is a must-read. This book is written in the first person point of view of three unreliable narrators: Rachel, Megan and Anna, all of whom are unlikeable (no surprise). The cause of Rachel’s recent divorce reduced her to becoming a depressed alcoholic and losing her job, as a result she goes on a daily commute on the train to pretend she’s going to work and thus became obsessed with a ‘perfect’ couple she sees on the terrace and she named them Jess and Jason. Megan is the girl on the terrace who succeeded in cheating and Anna is the new wife of Rachel’s ex-husband. It’s always been said that it takes 3 seconds to make a good first impression. When you start reading the first few chapters, I began to form a judgment on Rachel. I did feel sorry for her because she couldn’t pull herself together and stop drinking but her actions were a bit crazy. It gave me an impression that Rachel was lonely and to be part of something (the murder investigation) made her feel wanted. I was thinking why did she care so much about people she did not know? Who were these strangers to her? Nothing at all. Did they care? No. But once you read it, you understand the reason and the significance behind her choices. One character in particular has a dark secret; I’m not going to say who it is because of spoilers. It was quite shocking and surprising to read about them. It’s not what you’d see coming but its something that’d make the front-page tabloid news. A ‘whodunit’ storyline always entices me to keep reading, it’s so addictive! Once you know where the story is heading, you won’t want to put it down. Ironically, I read the first two chapters on the train. I use to go on daily train commutes to and from Art College and university; the train always had to stop midway before arriving at London Bridge for about 5 minutes or less. At that stop, there are really nice and expensive looking apartment flats with terraces. There would be no one there on the terraces but sometimes you’ll catch glimpses of people in their apartment doing whatever they’re doing. Sometimes, we get nosy but Rachel went a bit too far, giving Megan and Scott names and branding them a perfect couple, even though she knew absolutely nothing about them. Looks are deceiving. The Girl on the Train was not as mindfuck as Gone Girl but it was still such a fantastic read. I just couldn’t stop reading and kept me at the edge of my seat! I needed to know what happened. There were several people who you’d speculate and I only worked it out just before it was revealed. It kept me guessing a lot on whodunit because it wasn’t clear who was the culprit but then it all came together in a plot twist. I find it hard to believe that this is Paula Hawkin’s first book. If you enjoyed Gone Girl, then you will definitely love the Girl on the Train. (view spoiler)[I don’t know the significance of the redheaded guy on the train. It turns out he was just a minor character; he was there was nothing. I didn’t agree with what the therapist did. What he was told was in confidence and he violated that confidentially. There was something about this therapist. He seems to be very good at his job, in way that when he talks to you, you feel under his spell because Megan and Rachel were very captivated by him. (hide spoiler)]"
1832,DAYvid Hewitt (the biblioflick buff),"If I could replace the title of this book it's The PsychopathsI know that it is a cliché book with as my suggested title implies, all of them are psychopaths thus making almost all of them as suspects. But if you are mixing a darker color with another it gets more darker, or mixing tons of exotic foods together is weirder.The romance in this book, makes the atmosphere a tad bit darker as opposed to YA novels which make their novels lighter. A MUST READ. UNPUTDOWNABLE. READ IT BEFORE THE MOVIE COMES OUT, AND TREAT THE MOVIE AS ANOTHER MEDIUM FOR THE STORY. "
1833,Sarah Fay,"Fast and fun! I give The Girl on the Train a generous four stars for being such a quick compelling read - I admit to reading this book in the grocery store line, waiting rooms, and at red lights in traffic. It didn't want to be put down! Almost a Gone Girl meets Bridget Jones as a strung out lush. Also fairly predictable - almost formulaic mystery book script. But that didn't make it any less enjoyable. If you are like me, every once in a while you go for a cheeseburger and fries which tastes great going down - but it's a meal easily forgotten. Kind of like The Girl on the Train. Treat yourself to a fast read and then move on!"
1834,Emily (Falling for YA),"We have officially entered the Gone Girl era of novels. The mysteries are crazier, the murders more gruesome, and the psychological suspense has been ramped up to the max! The Girl on the Train follows Rachel a 30-something divorcee. Her ex-husband left her for another woman and she is struggling to cope with a divorce that happened a couple years ago. Every day Rachel rides the train past her and her ex-husbands house and slowly she becomes engrossed in the lives of a woman and her husband who live down the street from her former home. Rachel makes up a happy life and names, Jess and Jason, for the people who share the house. But when Jess turns up missing Rachel knows she has to help find her.I struggled to get through the first 80 pages of this book and it was because I didn’t like Rachel. She was a drunk and I, much like her flatmate, just wanted Rachel to get her life together. But, as the novel progressed and I got to know Rachel better I really came to like her. I loved learning more about her past and how it has effected her present. I also loved the fact that she was an unreliable narrator it made the mystery that much better.Overall, The Girl on the Train was a psychological thriller at its finest. After a little bit of a stumble the mystery drew me in and I had to know what was going to happen next. I’m already looking forward to reading whatever Paula Hawkins writes next. "
1835,Lindor Joelle,"This was a pretty good story and I loved the audio narration. I don't typically read mysteries, and if I did, I'm not sure if I would've understood all of the hype. The ending dragged out wayyyy too long in my opinion also. Overall I was eager to get to reading/listening everyday and would read another story by this author."
1836,Margy,"Remember how the suspenseful movie, Fatal Attraction, with Glen Close and Michael Douglas turned to horror at the end? That is how I feel about this book. It successfully maintains the suspense throughout the whole book. I was not disappointed in the ending, a clever bit of storytelling."
1837,Nikki Thompson,4.5 starsHad me guessing the entire time. Well written with a wonderfully twisted and layered plot. I couldn't put it down.
1838,John Riley,"hard not to use the cliche, but this novel is a wild train ride! at least three times did I change my mind on who was behind this whodunit."
1839,Lucía,"4 starsThis is my first thriller and I really liked it! I really didn't know if I was going to be into this kind of genre, but to be honest, the story kept me so intrigued at all times! I was really into how the author narrated this book: we have three different pov from three very different women. One of the girls' pov was in another timeline than the two other, and it was so interesting, because it slowly began to intertwine with the two other girls' pov, and slowly, everything was starting to make sense. Although at the beginning it was a little bit slow for me, I just loved how the story started, and how it developed; it had a very well explained background with lots of flashbacks that made you understand just how messed up these characters were, and it worked perfectly.This wasn't very predictable. Although, at the end, it was kind of hinted who was the ""bad person"" and I really thought it was just something to trick the reader, so I was quite disappointed when it was actually that person. Also, I felt that the climax scene the reader was waiting to unfold since the beginning, was actually kind of fast, and it was resolved very easily? I mean, it was awesome to read but, I felt like I needed something else from that ending. Nevertheless, it was still shocking to know what actually happened. There were some things left unanswered, or at least I think, but not essential things that really bugged me, and I guess, since I'm new to this genre, sometimes things are left purposely as a mystery. Anyway, I REALLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK! It was definitely a page-turner, and it really kept you at the edge of your seat, once you start finding out major plot points! "

1842,Kim Lillpop,It had a lot of twists and turns and kept me intrigued. Some parts were a little too drawn out but I also wanted to find out what happened. 
1843,Diane Lee,"I really enjoyed this book. Couldn't put it down and raced through it. I figured out the who dunnit fairly early on, but that didn't make it any less enjoyable. Liked the first person narration from the three female characters very much."
1844,Christina (Confessions of a Book Addict),"Everyday on the train into London, Rachel Watson looks out the window at the houses that fly by. She is especially intrigued by a couple that lives by the train tracks near her old home that she shared with her ex-husband, Tom. She calls this couple ""Jess and Jason"" and she thinks they are absolutely perfect. The irony is not lost on her that Tom lives a few houses down with his new wife, Anna, and their new baby. She isn't over her ex-husband and finds solace in alcohol. Her drinking has cost her more than her marriage though. It has even cost her her job, so now she rides the train to London everyday to keep up appearances and to get her roommate off her back. One day on the commute into London, she sees Jess with another man. This sparks Rachel's interest, because how could this infidelity happen? They seemed perfect together, or so she thought. Then she finds out ""Jess"" or Megan Hipwell, has gone missing. Rachel takes it upon herself to report what she saw to the police, but then things sort of get out of hand when Rachel remembers in a drunken haze that she was on Megan's street the night that she disappeared. To complicate things even more, she had a run in with Tom and Anna that night as well. The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins is an edge-of-your-seat debut that fans of Gone Girl will love. There are many twists and turns, unreliable narrators and a serious of who-done-it moments that will keep readers guessing.Read the rest of my review here: http://www.confessionsofabookaddict.c..."
1845,Saira Ali,"AMAZING! I casually walked into Waterstone during lunch, and this book was staring at me from a distance. I had no idea about the hype about this book, until I bought it and read the reviews. I was pretty excited at that point, and couldn't wait to finish work and ironically read the book on the train on my way home. And I did just that! I am also one of the many who analyse others from the train, but not quite as far as to invent other's lifestyle - I am not that creative! There are three narrators in this book, and all three can not be trusted.. in fact no one can be! Rachel's (the main narrator) love life and work life has fallen apart, and so she finds happiness in a couple who she watches from the train every morning and evening. But what happens when she sees something that disturbs her happy couple fantasy. She automatically feels involved - She wants to set it right, knowing that it doesn't concern her. At first it felt as if she was filling a void in herself, but maybe it is more than that, now it is not just about what she saw but about her drunken memory.She knows something is horribly wrong - Something dark and scary has happened but she cannot remember. A beautifully fast paced written book of three personalities and behaviors. Paula Hawkins has wonderfully understood and portrayed the real world problem that no one is innocent, everyone has a past and everyone has secrets.I think comparing this book to Gone Girl is a bit of a let down. Although I enjoyed reading Gone Girl, I was also getting quickly bored of it too.. it was too slow for me, personally - Whereas The Girl on the Train I read much faster. And not only that, I felt that the twists in The Girl on the Train was a little more gripping than the one twist in Gone Girl. I read Gone Girl for the story, and believe the movie was actually better. In comparison, The Girl on the Train was a real enjoyable read; the plots, the different characters and secrets kept me interested. Definitely give it a go."
1846,Erin Mendoza,"If you liked Gone Girl, you will probably like this. It's written in a similar fashion, with a similar story line, and just as unlikable characters. I couldn't put it down. After the beginning, it was well paced and suspenseful. Lots of twists."
1847,Ana  Lourenço,"Let me just put this out there: The characters in this book are horrible. I felt no sympathy towards all of them. Megan particularly got on my nerves. However, the book in general was a pleasant surprise for me.
The memories shifting like shadows, and I wonder, why am I doing this? What purpose does it serve?
I liked the writing, and I liked the general plot. To be honest at first I wasn't really feeling the whole voyeur thing, I still ain't but I felt like it worked. So, no complaints. Now the characters. I hated them all. Plain simple.
 I always knew there was something off about that woman. At first I thought she was a bit immature, but it was more than that, she was sort of absent. Self-involved. I'm not going to lie - I'm glad she's gone. Good riddance.
I don't know if I should be proud to completely agree with Anna because she's a stuck up bitch, but I feel like she summarized Megan pretty well on this quote.Lastly my reaction to every single scene where Rachel got drunk, then sick and then regretted it was of pure disbelief. I mean, how can one person cause so much damage to themselves and still do nothing about it ? And then whine constantly?Get your shit together girl.It was, overall, a nice book. I'm happy about it."
1848,Mason Engel,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Girl on the Train"". It was the first book in its genre I actually gave the chance, and I'm glad I did. Even despite my not being a psychological thriller fan, I was drawn in, particularly by the three main things: the writing, the plot, and the style.The Writing:Paula Hawkins has a way with words. I would go so far as to say her prose wouldn't seem out of place in high literature. That being said, however, her writing is easy to understand. It isn't bogged down by over description or plot stopping internal interludes. It constantly helps to move the story forward while still adding a lyrical flare.The Plot:As I stated above, I'm typically not a fan of the psychological thriller genre. ""The Girl on the Train"", however, may have changed that. Hawkins pulled me in with compelling protagonists (even if they weren't likable, they were at least complex enough to make me want to understand their motives) and a foreboding undertone of darkening suspense. I was especially drawn in by Rachel's detached narration on the train, which moved the plot forward in a distinctly unique fashion.The Style:The first person POV of the three narrators - in a sort of journal format - lends a personal feel to the story that may not otherwise have been created with a more traditional approach. The alternating viewpoints paint a holistic version of the story that gives the reader an insight into three very different perspectives and the inner workings of each. Hawkins choice in style was spot on for the story she needed to tell.Why not five stars?I was annoyed by the general depiction of women. Each narrator (Megan less so than the others) is framed almost entirely in terms of the man/men she is with. That is, the narrators seem to be defined exclusively by the opposite sex. All motivation stems from a sexual obsession which, though debatably accurate, I found distasteful.Overall, a very good read. I definitely recommend it."
1849,Eunice  S.,"4 stars. This book is pretty fucked up and I loved it. I'm not really a reader of psychological thrillers. I actually think this is my first. I usually like my thrillers in movie form. This was so good and I totally was blinded by the truth up until the main character, Rachel, was starting to figure it out. I mean at first I had the suspicion but I laughed at myself because I thought I was just being paranoid. But I was actually right to suspect something. It was really hard to guess who it was because you can't really trust any of the characters.I really enjoyed the characters and their craziness and rawness of all of them. Like what everyone says, they are indeed all horrible. It's kind of scary that I easily sympathize with Rachel. It was hard for me not to care for her character and it blinded me the way she was blinded from the truth. The other characters are so good as well especially with the three main characters including Rachel. They each have their own different personalities. The way Paula Hawkins can tap into those three alternating different POVs and connect it to one story while still being consistent with each of their personality is very impressive. It's really well done.A lot of people compare this to Gone Girl and I can't really attest to that because I only saw the movie. I do understand the comparison a little bit but I think it's only because they fall in the same genre. Judging by the story I saw from the Gone Girl movie, I think I prefer The Girl On The Train more. This book is really scary because it does make you question the things you think you know about people. It makes you question if sometimes do you only see what you want to see in people because some things blind you from seeing someone for who they really are. That's what I loved the most about The Girl On The Train and why I would recommend it to fans of psychological thrillers."
1850,Maxine,"The Girl on the Train is on a ton of reading list for 2015 and it is a great read. If you like mysteries then this is a good one to read. The Girl on the Train has been described as the British Gone Girl, I'd have to say that while Hawkins writes a compelling story its not quite as twisted. What the author does well is balance the story between 3 main female characters.Rachel is an alcoholic who spends a lot of her time on the train enjoy the pastime of people watching. But one day Rachel sees something that allows her to weave herself into the lives of strangers. Anna is the new wife to Rachel's ex-husband and a new mother trying to balance home life and the intrusive ex-wife. Megan is Anna's young neighbor a reminder of Anna's past and a woman with a dark secret of her own. The Girl on the Train is an interesting murder mystery and revolves around the idea that you can never truly be certain of person's secrets and past--whether you trust them or chose to be a spectator on their lives. "
1851,Shellie Zeigler,A classic thriller that had me hooked from the first chapter. It leaves you wanting to know more page after page. Highly recommend!
1852,Katerina,"Επιτέλους βρήκα χρόνο να γράψω την κριτική μου και γι’ αυτό το βιβλίο. Περίμενα πώς και πώς να το κάνω μιας και είναι ένα από τα καλύτερα βιβλία που διάβασα μέχρι τώρα το 2015. Πολλοί το χαρακτήριζαν ως το βιβλίο της χρονιάς, γι’ αυτό και ήθελα απελπισμένα να το διαβάσω. Τον τελευταίο καιρό προσπαθώ να μειώσω τα βιβλία που αγοράζω κάθε μήνα, μέχρι τουλάχιστον να διαβάσω αυτά που έχω, αλλά αυτό ήθελα οπωσδήποτε να το αποκτήσω.«Το κορίτσι του τρένου» είναι ένα πάρα πολύ καλογραμμένο βιβλίο που μου θύμισε πολύ «Το κορίτσι που εξαφανίστηκε», την ταινία, το βιβλίο δεν το έχω διαβάσει ακόμα. Είναι γραμμένα σαν ημερολόγιο και σε κάθε κεφάλαιο εναλλάσσονται τα πρόσωπα κάτι που εμένα μου άρεσε πάρα πολύ. Πολλές ανατροπές μέχρι το τέλος και κάτι που με ενθουσίασε ήταν το ότι υποψιάζεσαι συνεχώς όλους τους χαρακτήρες που σου παρουσιάζονται. Προς το τέλος το διάβαζα μανιασμένα γιατί ήθελα τόσο πολύ να μάθω τι τελικά έχει συμβεί;Όσον αφορά τους χαρακτήρες, ήταν από τις λίγες φορές που δεν «δέθηκα» περισσότερο με κάποιον από τους χαρακτήρες ή δεν συμπάθησα περισσότερο κάποιον. Τώρα θα μου πεις, μα καλά πώς γίνεται να μην προτίμησες κάποιον; Κι όμως γίνεται. Όλοι οι χαρακτήρες ενώ μου ήταν γενικά συμπαθείς, είχαν και κάτι, ένα χαρακτηριστικό ή μία συνήθεια για παράδειγμα, που με έκανε να αλλάζω γνώμη γι’ αυτούς. Η κεντρική ηρωίδα είναι η Ρέιτσελ, μία αλκοολική γυναίκα που δεν μπορεί να ξεπεράσει τον χωρισμό της, ενώ έχει περάσει αρκετός καιρός. Κατά κάποιον τρόπο, πενθεί τη χαμένη της σχέση και συνεχίζει να πίνει σαν να θέλει να τιμωρηθεί που δεν μπόρεσε να την κρατήσει ζωντανή. Περνάει αρκετό χρόνο στο τρένο, κάτι που θεωρώ πως την ανακουφίζει και σε μένα δεν ακούγεται περίεργο μιας και έχω παρατηρήσει πολλές φορές ότι οι διαδρομές με το τρένο με βοηθούσαν να χαλαρώνω και να μην σκέφτομαι τυχόν προβλήματα. Ένα άλλο από τα κεντρικά πρόσωπα που έχει στο βιβλίο μαζί με τη Ρέιτσελ δικά της κεφάλαια είναι η Μέγκαν, γι’ αυτήν δε θα πω πολλά γιατί είναι ωραίο να τα ανακαλύψεις όταν το διαβάσεις. Θα πω απλά ότι από την αρχή φαίνεται να δυσλειτουργεί στην καθημερινότητά της. Τα υπόλοιπα θα τα δεις μόνη σου. Και τέλος η Άννα, μία γυναίκα που ζει την τέλεια ζωή εκτός από τις φορές που διαταράσσεται από μία συγκεκριμένη γυναίκα. Όλες παλεύουν με λάθη και ενοχές και οι ζωές τους θα δεις ότι συνδέονται άμεσα.Αν σου αρέσουν τα θρίλερ μυστηρίου θα το λατρέψεις σίγουρα! Αν το έχεις διαβάσει, θα χαρώ πολύ να ακούσω τη γνώμη σου. Καλή ανάγνωση!"
1853,Nancy Brisson,"In Paula Hawkins’ novel The Girl on the Train, Rachel rides the train back and forth between London and the suburb where she lives. She reveals herself to us with each trip. We see her creating stories in her mind about a couple she sees each day near one of the stops on the way to London and again as she travels home. We become as keen to see what this couple is up to as Rachel is.We see that Rachel is drinking. Although at first it seems casual we soon understand that it is somewhat serious. Eventually we realize that Rachel is an alcoholic.Three women tell this story which begins with a tiny grave by some railroad tracks, a woman in some kind of extremely frightening situation, and a small pile of dirty clothing by the side of the rails that Rachel rides each day. Talk about foreshadowing. As we switch back and forth between glimpses of their lives at first we only see what Rachel sees. Rachel has very good reasons to stalk this particular set of town houses that back up to the train tracks. She once lived happily in one of those houses with her husband Tom.Just as a train picks up pace each time it leaves a station, this story is fleshed out each time we travel with Rachel past those Blenheim Road town houses. Rachel begins as a stalker but eventually she doesn’t keep her distance from these two couples, Anne and her ex, Tom and the “perfect” couple, Jess and Jason (actually Megan and Scott). When Megan goes missing on the exact Saturday that Rachel arrives back from a Blenheim Road “stalking” expedition with bleeding injuries and no memory of what she did that night, Rachel’s need to fill in those missing hours reveals truths about all three women and also about the men these women love. As a consequence of Rachel’s bumbling attempts to get answers, we, the readers, get to go along for a mind boggling, goose-flesh-raising, and tangled ride.The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins is engrossing and leads you on a very modern trip on a rather old-style train. When I am not thinking that Rachel may have done something unpardonable, I am thinking how much this book is like Alfred Hitchcock’s Rear Window with legs. (Yes, the Jimmy Stewart movie.)Your trust in humanity may suffer a bit as this one unravels. This novel gets full marks because, while perhaps not deeply literary, it is well written and obviously has great mass market appeal. It is difficult to put it down."
1854,Kody Jacobson,"The Girl On The Train was a very good mystery novel. A bit repetitive, but it was fast-paced and I, for one, couldn't put the book down. The mystery was great and had just enough gaps for me to make up my own crazy theories, including one involving me suspecting that Rachel was a twin or Rachel and Megan were the same person. I didn't have a problem with any of the characters, like a lot of people and I felt that the points of view were easy to tell apart. This definitely would have been a five-star read if the ending was executed a bit better. It wasn't the reveal of the murderer, because I didn't personally see that one coming, but the book spends 280 pages creating an amazing mystery and it ends in a quick 30 pages or so. I also wish there was more of a ""twist"" like the reviews on the book suggest. I was surprised, but the reveal felt dull and fell flat for me. I'll definitely be reading this again soon, this time keeping a close eye on the person behind the mystery."
1855,Anousha Vasantha,"Much like Gone Girl. The story was indeed a thriller and definitely kept me up reading. However, the main character being an alcoholic was a less enticing part of the book. The constant reference to her drinking was tedious and had no added value to the suspense of the story. Having said that, the storyline as a whole was interesting and would lend itself well to become a film one day. Overall I enjoyed reading The Girl on The Train, but the hype surrounding this book may slightly disappoint some readers when coming round to reading it. "
1856,Pat,"I agree that there is only one ""voice"", which is a shame, but it's still a page turner. "
1857,Heatherblakely,"I'm giving this a four because I was intrigued the entire time I was reading this book. I read it in a day. Sometimes I was reading because I was invested, other times I was reading and thinking ""oh good lord just let me get to the end so I can find out what happened.""I was a little disappointed, but only because this was hyped up as ""the next Gone Girl,"" and I loved Gone Girl so much that anything less than the same level of insanity would have disappointed me. So no, this is not Gone Girl. I would have liked it a lot more if that comparison hadn't been made so many times before I read this book. I liked the writing. I liked the shifting perspectives, and the changes in time weren't too jarring. I was expecting a slightly more twisted and convoluted ending--you find out what happens and then that's kind of it? But I didn't hate it. The entire time, I was trying to make guesses, and I slipped into Pretty Little Liars mode and assumed everyone had a twin or wasn't dead and then I was like wait, maybe EVERYONE is dead. I made up so many crazy stories that the actual story was less intense than everything I made up. "
1858,Richard,"This came really close to getting five stars from me, but I think the ending hits the clichés a bit too hard, and I wish the male characters had some of the emotional depth that the women show.Clever, suspenseful, well-written, and definitely recommended. Way ahead of most bestselling thriller fare."
1859,Manchester Military History Society (MMHS),"A compelling and intriguing psychological thriller about human weakness and obsession.This is Paula Hawkins first book and has already been signed up for a movie.The book centres around Rachel, an unemployed, recently divorced alcoholic who becomes involved in a criminal investigation as a result of what she witnesses on her daily commute into London. It's this storyline that intrigued me as I for one gaze out of trains and wonder at the lives that are glimpsed as we flash past.The story is told from the various viewpoints of the main characters and ratchets up the tension as you discover that almost all of them have something to hide. Once I got the hang of the names the book is a relatively easy read and doesn't get unnecessarily graphic in its descriptions.If you like your British crime like Broadchurch or Lewis then this is for you."
1860,Anton,"The girl on the train is filled with despicable characters. I had a really hard time getting into the story because of this. But then the mystery starts to unravel, like a slow train gaining speed, and it was a deeply unsettling experience. Towards the end and I my heart was racing and I could not put the book down. Very satisfying! P.S. I can't believe goodreads hasn't recommended this book to me before now. Odd. "
1861,Sheryl Ipsen,"Crazy, psycho ""who done it"" thriller book. Well written, I could not stop reading it once I started."
1862,Tu_vecino,"Una vez más las expectativas magnifican lo que esperas de la historia, sin embargo desde la página 1 quedas enganchado por el relato de la protagonista, empatizando con ella hasta el final. Gran libro, que brilla más por Rachel y sus problemas que por su final"
1863,Jean Cole,"The Girl on the TrainFirst, let me say that I love a good who-done-it. I also enjoy books in which the narrative point of view shifts from character to character because I enjoy learning how one character's memory or impression of events varies from another character -- even when they may be in the same room at the same time. And I enjoy flawed but sympathetic characters, because as we all know, in real life no one is all good or all bad.This book has all of the above, and is what I call a real page-turner. There's a difference, of course, between great or even good writing and good story-telling. This book is an example of good story-telling. If I had had the time I could have and would have read this book from cover to cover in one sitting. Is it great writing? No. But it is a compelling story with lots of suspense, and more than a few surprising twists and turns. A nice debut for Ms. Hawkins. It will be interesting to see if her next effort is as enjoyable."
1864,Cheryl Brydon,"Really enjoyed this! Read it in a day, couldn't put it down. Only down side was that I guessed the ending really early on in the story, which meant it didn't build up to a shock or have a big impact at the end. But maybe that was my fault for trying to figure it out! "
1865,Mrs. Dalton,"Normally, if I enjoy a book but the writing itself doesn't necessarily impress me, I'll give it three stars as a rating - a solid number. Although this book fits this description, I had to give it four stars. I was hooked immediately, finishing it in a matter of days, and I can't say that for many books. I didn't even care for the ending, yet Hawkins's ability to create suspense won me over. Great read!"
1866,Sbucior,Truth? I didn't know who was the bad person until pretty close to the end. So success in my book. Couldn't put it down. 
1867,Jess Dutton,"Circumstance and poor choices These characters and their tragic story reminded me so much of the characters in Casual Vacancy. They are victims of circumstance and in the end their pathetic lives and all their lies, to each other and to themselves, catch up with them. With no real ending for Rachel, I feel she suffered the most. This story kept me on the edge, but I couldn't quite piece things together until the very end, much like Rachel. Overall, it was good but I was left feeling disillusioned like all the characters in this book. "
1868,Cheryl,Love a good thriller and this one kept me guessing! The dates were a little confusing at times but overall good.
1869,Cis Hinkle,"Loved it. The structure (chapters hopping back and forth in time, centered on different characters) made it a little hard to follow at first. I found myself flipping back to check on details frequently. It was all worth it, however. "
1870,Stephanie Osborne,"I really enjoyed this book. It was different - which is why I'm pretty surprised at the comparisons to Gone Girl. While both are psychological thrillers, Gone Girl disturbed me while The Girl on the Train made me think. It made me think about people we bump into everyday and relationships. I was a bit concerned that the mystery would be easily solved with such a small cast of characters. But the author did a great job developing these few characters into such complex beings that I truly was unable to figure it out until the end. She did a great job of blurring the line between right and wrong, good and evil. She makes you root for people you do want to like and question those you would be drawn to. I appreciate that at various points during the book I thought everyone was ""innocent"" and everyone was ""guilty.""My only complaint with the book is that it ended a bit abruptly. After so many twists and turns I would have appreciated a cleaner finish. It's like she hit 300 pages and tried to wrap it up as quickly as possible. With such a small cast of characters I grew attached to each and every one of them and would have liked to followed each of them through the conclusion.I definite recommend this book. If you're deciding between Gone Girl and The Girl on the Train I can say that Gone Girl really gave me the creeps whereas The Girl on the Train was more of a traditional who-done-it mystery to solve."
1871,Elizabeth Ray,"The Girl on the Train keeps getting compared to Gone Girl and I'm not sure why. In this book, a wife disappears and her husband is blamed, but that's the only similarity. Well, there's also a ""twist,"" but don't a lot of books have that? I listened to Girl on the Train with my husband on audiobook. The interesting thing about it is that the characters aren't really likeable. I liked Anna and I'm not sure I was supposed to. She had an affair with the main character's husband. Somehow I could forgive her that. I think I liked her because she was just honest about things and she wasn't a pushover. The main character, Rachel, is pretty pathetic. It was an interesting choice, definitely different. She is still hung up about the break up of her marriage, she is friendless, and she was recently fired, but is lying about it to her one friend and landlord. When she becomes slightly involved in the case, she becomes obsessed because there is nothing else going on in her world. She lies and lies to stay part of the action and pretends she knows more than she does. This story was really slow-moving. Things were revealed very slowly and I'm not sure if I would have continued reading it were it not in audio format. Or maybe it would've been easier to read because I read faster than I listen! I liked the twist, but I guessed it beforehand, so it wasn't surprising to me at all. It didn't get too exciting until the end, but when it finally did, I enjoyed it. I enjoyed Gone Girl a lot more than this if you're trying to choose between the stories. This book is slow at times, but if you can hold on, I do think the ending is worth it. "
1872,Nicqui,"Interesting story.Having never read nor watched Gone Girl, but knowing the general gist of that story I can see the similarities. The characters were interesting and compelling. My issues with the book were with Tom, Anna and Rachel. It grated on me how pompous Tom and Anna were behaving in relation to Rachel considering that their relationship began as an extra-marital affair. They just had some nerve sitting on their high horse but considering the nature of the story, that was intentional. I see that, but it still bugs me. Perhaps I would have enjoyed the story more if that situation was not so... I want to say unrealistic, but unfortunately I know it's very real. Good story. I enjoyed it. It started a bit slow for me but when it got going it was hard to put down. I see the movie is expected next year and for the most part the casting is decent but I would prefer someone besides Chris Evans as Tom. I can't buy that. I think Jude law would be a very convincing Tom, just throwing that out into the universe. Good story. "
1873,Nada,"The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins, like Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn, is a cast of unlikable characters caught up in a story that keeps you reading because you want to know what happens. A woman prone to blackouts, a woman who disappears, a marriage based on adultery, and lots of secrets create the mystery of this book. I did guess the correct guilty party, but it was a whole lot of fun to see how the book got there.Read my complete review at: http://www.memoriesfrombooks.com/2015..."
1874,Kathe Dimeo Coleman,"The Girl on the Train by Paula HawkinsThe book is told from the perspective of three deliciously flawed characters. Each chapter is written by one of these main characters so paying attention to the date and narrator of each chapter is imperative.The “girl on the train” is Rachel. Rachel is a mess. She is unemployed but continues to commute back and forth to a job she no longer holds and is a hopeless alcoholic with a history of blackouts. She has a hard time distinguishing fact from fiction. She becomes obsessed with a couple she sees from the train whom she names Jess and Jason (actually Megan and Scott) and yearns for their seemingly idyllic life. Megan also happens to be the neighbor of Tom, Anna and their baby Evie, Tom being Rachel’s ex-husband whom she still mourns. Anna appears to be the perfect second wife. So many twists and turns in this book that it is easy to devour in an afternoon."
1875,Jill Mulligan,"Despite not liking any of the characters, I enjoyed the book. It was strange feeling little emotional tie to any of the characters and not being too concerned if anything bad happened to them, but I feel that shows the book was good as I still couldn't put it down wanting to see what would happen in the story."
1876,Duane,"Well, that was entertaining. I can see what all the hype is about. There was a lot I liked but a few things I didn't, which kept me from giving it 5 stars. What I didn't like: First there were no likeable characters in this book, none. The female characters were flawed, weak, even submissive. I don't want to forget they were living in fear, being abused, both mentally and physically, but still. The men were just awful. One was a psychopath, the other a jealous, abusive brute. Even the secondary characters fell short of being decent. The foreshadowing with Megan was confusing because it wasn't in the same time frame. What I did like: This was a debut novel, that's impressive. I liked the pace of the novel, it truly is a page turner. I liked the quick changing point of views, that's the way I like to read. The writing was obviously good.I would llike to say one thing about alcoholism, which is a prevalent theme in this book. I have witnessed it's effect first hand in my sphere of family and friends. Rachel was struggling with this along with the other negative issues in her life. In the end she was able to find the strength to overcome, to find the will to do the right thing. I was proud of her at the end."
1877,Eric Kibler,"A thriller that didn't, as I feared, have a predictable ending.The characters were all touched with corruption and weakness, against the backdrop of a longing for idyllic love.Especially well-drawn is the portrait of the main character's depression and alcoholism.This book is suspenseful and keeps you turning pages, and will leave you uneasy after you close it.It reminded me, for various reasons, of ""Rear Window"", "" Crime and Punishment"", and ""Twelve Angry Men"", a somber, rain-soaked journey into darkness."
1878,Merry,"If you haven't yet read this book, keep in mind when you do that the first 100 pages are so painful it's hard to continue reading. It begins from the perspective of an extremely unlikable character, is depressing, and told entirely in the thoughts of the characters (no dialog). But curiosity got the best of me (how can this book have so many 5 star ratings?) so I kept reading. Soon the plot draws you in, and then you're hooked. The author keeps you wondering who could ""have done it,"" until a few chapters from the end, making it unfortunately somewhat anticlimactic. Definitely not the book for everyone, this is a solid psychological thriller."
1879,linda,"Perfect vacation book, couldn't put it down and couldn't wait to pick I up !"
1880,Miffy,"3 1/2 stars.For the first two thirds of this book the three main characters, who are all female, drove me NUTS! Whinging, whining, irritating losers and liars - all three. Rachel, who is the focus voice, is an unemployed alcoholic, an ex-wife, and the most unreliable of unreliable narrators. Megan is also a liar, but is up front with us about what she has lied about. And Anna is a psychotic, paranoid liar. Not three of the most attractive protagonists I've ever read. But each of them evokes sympathy and empathy for the situations they have willingly put themselves in. I think that thing I found most frustrating about them all was their passivity - how prepared they were to be walked all over by other people, how trusting. Even in the last moments of the book, when I was shouting at the car stereo to tell them what they should do, their lack of decision making skills was beyond belief.That said, it is a gripping read in the end. I guessed the ending about two-thirds of the way through, so the rest of the book I was just waiting to see if I was right, but the tension builds and builds and builds, until you finding yourself screaming at the top of your lungs for them to run the hell away! Somewhat obvious, but entertaining."
1881,Bridget Simpson,"Gripping, couldn't put it down. "
1882,Mirjam,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. So so good. Twists and turns and just a damn good read, go on read it!!!!"
1883,Duds Saldanha,no geral foi uma leitura bem prazeirosa e que me fez até surpresa em alguns momentos. a protagonista tem seus defeitos (e MUITOS) mas não o suficiente que a impeça de evoluir. vocês com certeza vão me ouvir falando mais sobre ele.
1884,Abbie Susan,"I loved this book, and precisely for the reason some people hate it. Yes the characters are unlikeable and make you feel uncomfortable, but what a breath of fresh air it was! It makes a change from vigorously skim reading through all the over descriptive, boring writing in the style that I've come across time and time again. Hawkins gets straight to the point and carries your attention throughout, without the novel ever getting boring. I loved the gritty and 'depressing' tone of the novel, as it made it that more realistic. The main character was an alcoholic, so she's not exactly going to be singing about rainbows and butterflies is she? You could literally feel how anxious and depressed she was as a result of drinking every day which I thought was brilliantly written. Although I'd guessed who the culprit was near the end, my opinion is that it isn't exactly the story that makes this novel stand out, it's the way it is written. Although I loved gone girl and never thought I'd find anything better, I found myself preferring this one as it was more realistic and relatable, which I personally found more interesting."
1885,Jenifer,"Paula Hawkins writes engagingly, creates characters whom one might meet in real life -- though I wouldn't want to meet some of them. Early on, I was struck by the moral relativism of the main characters. It bothered me a lot: I didn't like them, wasn't sure I wanted to finish the book. But then, the story took hold. No, I didn't agree with most of the choices several of the characters made, but I felt compelled to keep reading, to find out what happened to them. For those who like satisfying endings, I think you won't be disappointed."
1886,Heidi,"kept me turning pages as quickly as possible to figure out ""who done it?"" "
1887,Carolina Edvinsson,My review in swedish ---> Romeoandjuliet
1888,Jillian Jesson baxter,Not sure I liked any of the characters but I still wanted to get to the end. It was like Rear Window by not sure who is crazy and who telling the truth.
1889,Lindsay,Great thriller! Now I know what all the hub bub is about. Couldn't put it down.
1890,Amanda Bollacker,"The thing about unlikable characters is that we're ALL unlikable characters to some degree, and that's why we don't like them -- we can see pieces of ourselves in obsessive, desperate, alcoholic Rachel, and I won't really talk about the others because...SPOILZ. That being said, this book is continually compared to ""Gone Girl."" I can see the comparison only to the point that both are suspense novels that are also character studies on several main characters. In this case, it's women.  The cover art -- normally, I don't think much of it, because it's either too simple or cliched, but to be honest I thought it was very cleverly done. The image is obviously of a scene rushing by as one sits on a train. But could it not also represent the blur of a rush of a drunken night? One where you might not remember very well, and perhaps that one drunken night happened to be a Saturday, where everything is a blur and you really, really ought to remember? Finally, the double lettering reminds me of the jostling of train cars on the tracks. But it also can stand for duplicity. We have a slew of unreliable narrators-- cheaters, liars, alcoholics -- all trying to convince themselves that it's OK to do these things, that they're really trying, that they deserve happiness, that it's okay to destroy other people's things for the sake of their own. I loved Rachel's quote -- something about how following your heart always leads to disaster, and doing it is only ever foolish. I liked the writing a great deal and I enjoyed the character studies, but it was the plot for me that felt a little ... meh. I was looking for the great writing to create a little more plot. I was looking for ""Rear Window"" suspense. In other words, I was looking for more Rachel-on-the-Train seeing things, and less Rachel-gets-on-the-train-in-the-first-quarter-of-the-book-and-then-sees-something-immediately, leading to the last 3/4 being more filler and Rachel trying to convince people she saw something. I wish that ""Jess and Jason"" were more developed as IDEAS that Rachel had, because that would have made the Megan parts more shocking.Again, more staring out the window on the train, less other fluff. Even if Rachel continued narrating six months' worth of taking the train in the morning / taking the train of the evening just to note her thoughts on Jess and Jason and what they're doing, I think that would have left a greater impact when she finally sees what she sees -- and to be honest, what she sees is also very ... meh. Nothing I would define as shocking, particularly if she doesn't know them. If I had seen it, I would have been like, ""Well, wow, so that's...your life, good luck, but I don't know anything about you, so I guess I'll just forget about it."" I did very much enjoy the idea of alcoholic blackouts. It made for an interesting protagonist and I liked the center of the whole story, the key to the puzzle, being locked away in a blackout. What happened Saturday night? Who knows! And the guilt that results from that is very genuine. The ending was a copout though. Just saying. Everything fit the narrative...but oh geez, seriously? Ugh. I wish there was more to it.  TL;DR: More girl on the train, and less of everyone else. "
1891,Nikki Stafford,"This book has been touted as the Gone Girl of 2015 (and many people are adding the caveat, ""But not as good""), and I will agree that it's a page-turner. I didn't think it was from page one, however; it took some getting into. In fact, when I was on page 30 I ended up picking up another book and starting it instead, but later that day I thought no, I should get back to this one. And then it began moving, and once it does — pardon the pun — it really does move along at the pace of a freight train. The main character, Rachel, is the girl on the train, thinking she's seen something from the window and then becoming involved in other people's lives when a woman disappears from her old neighbourhood. The problem is, Rachel is a raging alcoholic, and so she's an unreliable narrator. The black holes in her memory contain the most important puzzle pieces, and throughout the book she struggles to find them. I really enjoyed it, and no, it doesn't have the same number of twists as Gone Girl, and some of the characters are a little black and white and it doesn't have the complexity, but it might have a slightly more satisfying ending than that book did. It's definitely a fun, light, and suspenseful read. "
1892,Eleonora,"Ho cominciato a leggere questo libro su consiglio della mia amica Lisa ed inizialmente non sapevo che aspettarmi: Rachel, la protagonista, non sembra altro che un'ubriacona annoiata che passa le sue giornate a bordo di un treno, che la porta a Londra, e che ama sbirciare che succede nelle case degli altri. Ogni mattina, infatti, Rachel non perde occasione di guardare cosa fanno gli abitanti nel quartiere dove fino a poco tempo fa aveva abitato con il suo ex marito. Proprio nello svelare la sua vita passata la protagonista abbandona il ruolo di ""donna frustrata e noiosa"" per divenire ""donna amareggiata dalla vita"" che cerca il sostegno dei lettori. Si scopre che per Rachel i problemi con l'alcool sono cominciati in seguito all'abbandono del marito e al desiderio mai avveratosi di diventare madre. Nella sua vita grigia e piena di difficoltà, con la sola compagnia di un'amica che la ospita presso la propria casa, Rachel diventa all'improvviso parte di un complicato intreccio che comprende la sparizione di una donna e delle strane visioni offuscate dagli eccessivi bicchieri di vino. Da questo momento il romanzo abbandona lo stile rosa per diventare un thriller (soft) che coinvolge il lettore fino alle ultime pagine. Consigli: astenersi amanti del genere poliziesco, avanti tutta lettori che credono nel riscatto di una protagonista un po' antipatica e maldestra."
1893,H,Great vacation read.
1894,Joyce,"Superb Page Turner of Voyeurism, Heartache and AlcoholismHave you ever sat near the window on a train and observed people in their apartments, offices, or homes! Children playing outside the same time every day? Husbands leaving for work? A secretary staring at a computer screen? A woman looking happy and serene or quite disturbed? Paula Hawkins grabs the reader as the main character, Rachel, rides the 8:02 AM to London every business morning and conjures up stories about the people she sees from the train. Rachel returns from London a 5:00 train, but in between she is roaming around London pretending to her landlord, Cathy, that she has a job.Rachel is an alcoholic, spending her time and money sloshing from scene to scene. Her drunken escapades produce blackouts making her voyeurism on the train remarkable. Rachel has no self esteem since she has lost her husband, Tom, to another woman. She is more than forlorn, she barely functions. I felt like the author was moving me from one drunken stupor to another.Rachel observes an idyllic couple from the train and then sees their lives change. She is so desperate to be worthy to someone, she pretends she may know more than she does about the woman, Megan, the beautiful woman of this destructive couple. Hawkins uses Rachel's alcoholism as a barrier to reality undercutting any self confidence for her. The women in the plot are part cloying, depressed and hold secrets.As the mystery reaches a climax, I expected a real surprise ending, but it isn't there. This book does not compare to Gone Girl. However, it did hold my attention and the machinations and evolvement of Rachel's emotions are worth the read."
1895,frogfairie,"I noticed that people were comparing this book to ""Gone Girl"" which is actually one of my favorites. I couldn't understand why they were comparing the two but now as I look back I can see similarities: the way the story is told, bouncing between different perspectives; the fact that the wife goes missing; the unlikable characters. If those aspects are unappealing to you, go ahead and give this book a pass. Otherwise, I recommend this story. It will take you for a ride of mystery and the slow revealing of each character's true self. "
1896,João Penetra,Great great great. It's so addictive. Can't wait to read another book from Paula Hawkins. 
1897,Ling,"Reminded me so much of Gone Girl - just as suspenseful, just as much of a page turner. I can see why this one was so popular as well and will undergo the same fate of a movie in the works. I did predict what would happen about 3/4 of the way through, but this did not stop me from steamrolling through to read the exact details. A friend asked if I felt this book was reflective of empowered women, or the opposite. I think it depends on what point of the story you are at. The character of Rachel was extremely irritating to me for most of the book...and the other characters weren't much better. I did find this comment interesting since I had finished Big Little Lies not too long ago and that theme/concept was prevalent in both. "
1898,Melinda,"The girl on the train is Rachel, an unemployed alcoholic still bitter from her divorce from Tom. She travels each day to and from London and soon begins to fantasize about the people she notices as she stares out the window. Then there's a murder ... but there will be no spoiler here! I can say this was an excellent psychological thriller that kept my interest throughout. Good pacing; well written; suspenseful. The chapters shifted between three narrators each dropping subtle hints regarding ""the mystery"". Despite the fact that most of the characters were pretty unlikeable, I really liked this book. Kept me guessing until the end."
1899,Marlene Banks,Good story with a decent treatment to keep you reading further. Mystery aspect was a bit weak as I figured out the killer too soon. Still the human aspect and the protagonist's story was well done. Over all I like the novel. It was different and intriguing.
1900,Fatima,Really dark but I have to say I liked it. Read it in one sitting. Something about the narrator - I found her relatable and was rooting for her despite her lunacy.
1901,Tomader Almahdi,*slow claps it out* 
1902,Regan,Good read but the ending fell a little flat for me 
1903,Nidofito,"A solid debut by Paula Hawkins. And very surprising too! I glanced at the synopsis a while back before I got a chance to read the book but it was nothing from what I remembered. At first I was a little bummed out but that feeling lasted maybe a chapter in before I was fully engrossed in the book. The ""shocking scene"" that Rachel saw mentioned in the synopsis takes a while to be revealed and honestly, I had forgotten about it, so invested was I in the lives of Rachel and the other characters. Beginning of the book, I couldn't help myself be disgusted by Rachel. IRL you would avoid associating yourself with a person like her. It's a shame because, as you read, you can tell there's a smart and focused personality underneath all that alcohol and depression. I also felt sad for her because although she says that it was solely her fault for breaking her marriage and considering what I know now about her and Tom, I know that isn't true. Later on, as you read through her struggle against alcoholism, your impression of her changes and you can't help yourself but cheer for her. When she gets a hand on her alcohol intake; you're happy for her yet are waiting with bated breath to see how long before she starts drinking herself into a stupor again. And when she does, you're disappointed yet not surprised. And then comes the shame, the regretful actions, the vows to stop cold turkey that lasts for a few days until it doesn't and on and on the cycle goes. Underneath all that though, she has a wounded fragile heart that would cause her to cry when a stranger would be kind to her, or on the loss of an unborn child of a person she's never met before.Those were the most heart breaking moments for me, the realization of her lack of companionship, her absolute loneliness, and her imagined worthlessness. And when you're confused with emotions and dead ends all over the place, it comes together. All the hints scattered across the book, jumbled up to make the reader have second and then third thoughts, they get together to have this epic moment of clarity with the tension cranked up high, all thunder and lightening and rain. And you're sitting there at the edge of your seat, hoping and praying that it doesn't go to waste.Overall, the author does a marvellous job going deep into the psyche of all the characters presented in the book to make the readers realize that nothing is what it seems upon first glance. They're all ugly characters but she plays superbly well as a devil's advocate for all of them which causes the readers to continuously shift their opinion and impression of them so that you are unable to make a judgement until she explains everything from every perspective, not a single thing missed, right onto the final page of this incredibly story."
1904,Anntonette Alberti,"Very well done, compelling psycho-thriller. I think I figured it out well before the ending, but I was not *sure* and was thus hooked until the last page. "
1905,K.J. Gillenwater,"I bought this book because it was recommended to me due to my love of ""Gone Girl."" 1) It was entertaining. The 4 stars make that clear. I would consider it, more or less, a 'page turner' once I got used to the 3 different perspectives in the book.2) It was not as good as ""Gone Girl."" In fact, due to the storyline and the multiple POVs, it seemed like a 'lesser' version of a better book. Made me wonder if Ms. Hawkins wasn't inspired by Flynn's writing.3) I dislike information reveals in unbelievable conversations. This book had that element. It felt a bit fake and cheap to me. The author had done such a good job of revealing information through different perspectives, that I disliked the conversation approach (those who have read it will know what I'm talking about).I rate a book based on a number of things. After stumbling through the beginning, I grew more interested in the story and where it was leading. I began to get the 3 characters straight in my head, which made it much, much easier to read by about the 1/3 point. I will admit that the later 1/3 of the book I would consider 'un-put-downable,' which vaulted this into it's 4-star rating.Enjoyable read. Not as good as ""Gone Girl."" Would pick up another book by this author to see if I like her other work."
1906,Abby Wilson,"This book really had me gripped from the moment I started reading it. I felt, however, that the characters were a bit off. The plot was brilliant and I really liked the female presence (unlike that in Gone Girl). A great thriller and I think I'm beginning to become a fan of this genre..."
1907,Vanessa,"my problems with books like that is always that i know who the killer is (or at least i have a wry strong guess) and then i'm kind of disappointed when i'm right. the same was with this book, i had this suspicion who the murderer was and was proven right (how boring). Otherwise the book was really addicting and the characters very interesting. The whole story and writing style reminded me really of Gone Girl and the book is definitely worth a read!"
1908,Gemma,"Reazione a caldissimo: FINALE SODDISFACENTE, OH YEAH!Per me ormai i finali dei thriller psicologici sono una parte fondamentale della struttura del romanzo: devono essere coerenti con il resto della storia, e ultimamente (si Gillian Flynn, parlo di te! Vedi Gone Girl e Dark Places) rimanevo delusa dalla conclusione di romanzi che fino a quel momento erano quasi perfetti.Per La ragazza del treno invece, FINALMENTE la conclusione è stata degna della storia. Il romanzo in sé è ben scritto, ben riuscito e i personaggi sono folli al punto giusto per questo genere letterario. Certo, avrei voluto fosse più lungo per cogliere più sfumature dei protagonisti ma in generale l'esperienza di lettura si è rivelata più che positiva.Sono diventata io troppo brava a capire il colpevole oppure era abbastanza evidente? :P Ai posteri l'ardua sentenza.ps: voglio sapere TUTTO dell'adattamento cinematografico in atto!"
1909,Michelle Silvestri-Oetinger,"I enjoyed the book...it took me two days to finish. Each chapter alternately follows the story of three women. None of the women are very likable, but, that's what makes it a good read. I like when an author can make you dislike a character. And, being I'm no detective, I only began to piece things together when the author wanted me too! Definitely a good read for book clubs!"
1910,Sambasivan,Vey good debut. The story told from the point of view of three characters. Could have distinguished the writing style of each. But the whodunit is holding up till the very end and that makes it a worthwhile read. 
1911,Jill,"Rachel loves to ride the train each day and watching her favorite couple ""Jason & Jess"" as she passes by her old neighborhood. They seem like the perfect couple until she sees something suspicious from the train one day. She couldn't ignore the sight, and suddenly her life gets intertwined with theirs. Told in multiple perspectives with important details missing to keep you guessing until the conclusion of the novel. I enjoyed this read, but I still prefer reading YA!"
1912,Katy,I thought it was going to be along the lines of Gone Girl which I did not like. But this book was much better in that it was faster paced. I could have easily read this in one sitting. 
1913,Jennifer Boyce,A quick and enjoyable read with a good plot twist near the end of the story. Would recommend to those interested in books about pretty messed up people and to those who enjoy glimpses into the lives of others.
1914,Laurie Sampson,"One of my favorite movies is ""Rear Window"" and trying to figure out if the characters really saw what they thought they did. ""The Girl on the Train"" follows suit as you try to determine who really saw what!"
1915,Sue Larson,"Like a Nancy Drew mystery. Had it figured out before she thought it was Scott, just not the how's."
1916,Punk Monkey,"So first things first. If you liked Gone Girl, you would love The Girl On The Train. Paula Hawkins seems to be the long lost sister of Gillian Flynch, arriving from the shadows and exploding like a star on the literary screen. You WILL have a great sense of deja vu permeating your senses as you go through the description of the characters, situations, plots.This is Gone Girl part deux, make no mistake. For someone who debuted as a writer for a novel, Paula Hawkins, her of Zimbabwean origins, writes very very tightly. Her plot leaves no scope for doubts, no scope for letting the reader imagine that the situation could have been handled better, no loose ends anywhere.You will be on the edge of the seat till about 85% of the novel after which the climax kind of gives away. What I was upset about is that the climax presents itself perchance, not a tightly wound spring waiting to be unwound with a bang. It just appears out of nowhere which is slightly debilitating to my intelligence.That said, the novel is a surefire winner and a book which you should read to stay update on what's happening on the mystery writing scene in London and otherwise."
1917,Saumya,Unexpected ending and couldn't see what's coming until the end
1918,Sandy Reilly,"Wow. I'm honestly not even sure where to start... Rachel, the girl on the train, is an alcoholic ex-wife who has trouble remembering while also having trouble letting go, harboring guilt, shame, and an all-incompassing obsession... Megan, the girl on the terrace, is harboring more secrets than even she knows... And Anna, the ""other"" girl, is harboring anger towards them both, even if she's not entirely sure why at first... They have more in common than they know, and Paula Hawkins weaves their stories together with a fast-paced thriller that will leave readers feeling waves of empathy and disgust for each if them.I very much enjoyed this story. I wouldn't put it in the same writing category as Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl, even if it is the same genre. Both are very interesting, and I felt invested in each plot and its characters. The only thing separating these two is that Hawkins gives readers a bit more information, helping us put the pieces of the puzzle together faster than the main character, and without much of a twist once you've figured it out. Except Anna's final ""twist"", pun intended. Those of you who have already read the book will get that poor attempt at a joke..."
1919,January Newbanks,"It was definitely a book that grabs you, sucks you in, and takes you on a bit of a crazy wild goose chase before revealing the whodunit. I first heard of the book on Tana French's Facebook page. The Secret Place (TF's latest) was on a list of books to read if you were looking for something similar to The Girl On The Train so I thought I'd give it a read. Unlike French's stories, I wasn't very invested in any of the characters, but it was dark and twisty and a good read for sure. My rating is probably more like 3.5. I'm definitely in between ""liked it"" and ""really liked it."""
1920,Tricia Hock,"I really wish GoodReads had half stars. This was really worthy of 3.5 stars, not 4. It was a bit too much Gone Girl for me, but at least I didn't throw this book when I finished it. "
1921,Brittany,So I just read this in one sitting and it's currently 4.30am lol. I kind of picked the ending so it loses a star but I couldn't put it down because I had to know who done it which is really how I think every good thriller should be.
1922,JoAnn,"Entertaining, exciting, enthralling - impressive debut!"
1923,Closetsbycarol,A page turner with a hot mess of characters.
1924,Chelsea LaVere,"Contemporary fiction isn't really my thing so ""The Girl on the Train"" wasn't my first choice when it comes to books in general, but it was my book club's selection, and I was pleasantly surprised (and not just because it was set in England!). The writing is very good, and the storyline believable with the entire thread of suspense throughout the book. A modern thriller with a bit of Whodunit undertones, it was a slow start (especially because I couldn't really get into any of the characters), but once I got through the first half, I couldn't put it down. If you also have an overactive imagination like I do, you'll definitely never have a normal train ride ever again after reading this one, that's for sure."
1925,Anmol Rawat,"You can read my full book review here.Wow! The Girl on the Train. This was as interesting as Gone Girl and I'm really glad I picked it up. An extremely pacy read with a mystery that is not easy to unfold. Amazing debut by Paula Hawkins.If you like to read psychological thrillers or mysteries, this is a must for you."
1926,Christine Sinclair,"This quote from the dust jacket says it best: ""Compulsively readable, The Girl on the Train is an emotionally immersive, Hitchcockian thriller and an electrifying debut."" My only complaint is the structure, which I found somewhat confusing. I had to keep turning back to keep track of the timeframe, which was annoying. Great characters, though, and a plot that keeps you guessing. A very good read!"
1927,Penny,"4.5 possibly 5 stars.So very compelling and with every page I just wanted to delve deeper into the minds of the characters. Such interesting and layered characters too! Not sure if I liked any of them although they did invoke such a range of emotions (sympathy, disgust, pity, frustration...) that I just couldn't stop reading."
1928,RitaSkeeter,"I don't read thrillers all that often, but when I do I really enjoy them. Part of the 'thrill' for me with these type of books, aside from the, you know, nail biting tension and suspense, is trying to outsmart the characters to see if I can work out who the killer is before them. Now, either I've lost my touch or this book is more clever than a lot in the genre because I was very slow at working out what was happening in this book. I was supremely confident I had it worked it out, but then more and more information came out and the book took twists and turns, and it turned out I was supremely....wrong. Good fun.I've seen this promoted as the next Gone Girl, and there are some similarities. Both have unreliable narrators, despicable characters (although I liked Rachael) and... can't say more - spoilers! But, I don't really think the books are alike at all; it definitely isn't the comparison I would draw. I felt the book was more an amalgam of Into the Darkest Corner and Before I Go To Sleep in both plot, and in developing that same hazy, unsettling vibe both those books had. There were some things I found irritating about the early parts of the novel. The exposition of characters was fairly heavy handed, with chapters and chapters of internal monologue and only a line or two of incidental dialogue. I wouldn't say the early part of the novel was tedious, but it was long winded. So if you start the book and feel a bit uncertain about it, I suggest to keep going with it because it does improve and quickly becomes a very gripping read. I wouldn't say this was the greatest thriller I've ever read, but it was a very good read, and a very promising start from a debut author."
1929,Teresa Kendall,"Okay, first I want to talk about the misleading blurb on the book. It compares the story to a Hitchcock movie, presumably Rear Window (one of my absolute faves) and hints that the narrator will have to try to prove that the crime or bad thing she witnesses was real. Blurb also throws around a Gone Girl reference, which all recent thrillers seems to want to be compared to lately. This premise is pretty much my sole reason for picking up the book. I mean, you had me at Alfred Hitchcock. Gone Girl comparison, too? Even better! Well, I discovered right away that this is not the actual story. But that's okay! What I found instead is an unreliable narrator and I love, love, love an unreliable narrator!! The reader finds out very quickly that the narrator is a drunk prone to blackouts. She can barely function while drinking and she does that a lot. Also, she is not the only narrator, so that added another level of intrigue to this tale. Also, the timeline jumps back and forth. All good stuff, leading up to a satisfying conclusion that even has a surprise plot twist! I enjoyed this thriller. I do, however, take issue with the completely misleading blurb. I mean, did the person even read the book? Lol!Anyway, solid four stars for Paula Hawkins' debut novel -- I will definitely check out any future books she writes:)"
1930,Mafi,"4,5 estrelasNão sabia bem o que esperar deste thriller mas sabia que ia encontrar personagens bem peculiares. As primeiras 75 páginas do livro aborreceram-me e estava pronta para desistir, porque a protagonista - Rachel - estava a dar-me cabo dos nervos. Fiquei surpreendida ao perceber que havia três linhas narrativas das três personagens femininas - estava pronta para que o livro fosse todo do ponto de vista da Rache - mas gostei desta opção da autora. Gosto sempre de ter uma visão múltipla do que está a acontecer, dá-nos a sensação que conhecemos muito melhor as personagens do que só termos um ponto de vista. A narrativa em trio também ajudou a complicar e a desvendar todo o mistério apresentado no livro. Ao princípio temos o cérebro com nós, de tanta coisa que não faz sentido mas quando mais lemos, mais pecinhas se vão juntando, mais o puzzle vai ficando completo. opinião completa: http://algodaodoceparaocerebro.blogsp..."
1931,Esra,"Çok sevdim, aşırı sevdim fakat eksikleri vardı toplasam bir çuval eder mi bilmiyorum ama 5 vermek gelmedi içimden... Katili her şeyi söylememe rağmen tahmin edememişim ve Rachel bence FBI 'da çalışsın. "
1932,Rachel Skye,"This got a lot of Gone Girl esque sort of hype. I unfortunately haven't read any of Flynn's work (trust me I will!) I actually saw and heard of this via a few friends and to my pleasure, Kimberly McCreight, Reconstructing Amelia author, had written praise for the book so I had to read it. This genre of mystery-crime thriller that juxtaposes story timelines is pretty huge right now, and I definitely dig it. Structure is so important in books and I think Paula Hawkins does an absolutely incredible job of making a fragmented plot flow and she has that magic touch where she can make different sides of the stories (at different times in the story) mesh. The Girl on the Train follows a few characters, mainly Rachel, as she goes about her very dysfunctional life. It juxtaposes a made up fantasy life of Jess and Jason's ideal life. Of course it is all made up in her head. Jess is actually a cheating, wild, free-spirited Megan, and Jason is the controlling, jealous husband Scott. Scott sounds a lot worse than he is but in all honesty, not one character has true redeeming qualities. Not one. I hate every single one of them. Four houses or so down from ""Jess and Jason"" is Rachel's old house she shared with her now ex-husband and he just so happens to be living there with his mistress and daughter. As the story unfolds you get Rachel's drunken and jagged point of view of the perfect life, Jess and Jason, as well as her past life she has eft behind. You also get a glimpse into the past with Megan, and Anna's point of view that's a bit on the outside but she clearly has issues. Anna and Megan are tied together because Megan is sleeping with Tom, Anna's husband, who also happens to be Rachel's ex-husband. Rachel is connected to Megan because she invented a story she longingly wished for, as she watched them on the train. When Megan disappears, Rachel and Scott begin to try to place some pretty fragmented pieces together but she realizes Scott's anger and jealous tendencies. Every character is tied together in some sort of super love triangle. There are pretty big twists. I was set off the wrong path at first, but the more you read and get sucked in the more you are attempting to figure out the clues. I did suspect Tom (due to his past 'mistress loving past') being the killer but I also thought it may of been Anna (out of jealousy)or Rachel (out of jealousy for Scott?). I never thought it was Scott. I can say this. Tom is a lying, manipulative tool. Scott is a jealous, angry raging mess. Rachel is a depressed alcoholic. Megan is an attention seeking, cheating, unhappy wife. Anna is a literal jealous psychopath. There is not one character that you like, which is why this is so brilliant. I wanted to be on some of their sides, but as soon as you find out who they truly are, you hate them even more and you begin to understand how unreliable each one of them is. "
1933,Mai Nou,"
The Girl on the Train warranted a story of intrigue, psychological mysteries and quite a lot of character development.
Paula Hawkins allows the reader to know the characters and understand their emotions from her artfully developed alternative point of views between Rachel, Megan and Anna. The success of a character's growth, her rise and fall and giving the reader the feel of understanding all of this development without the need to write a book of a thousand or more pages takes cleverness. I can understand and almost feel the depression of Rachel, the paranoia of Anna and the denial of rejection from Megan. Hawkins successfully played the timelines and the points of views from each woman on the same days without being repetitive - as repetition can be the aspect that brings a book down. Each time she alters between a character, a new detail comes to light.Another aspect that Paula Hawkins' The Girl on the Train was successful at was its unpredictability. As each clue or thought is slowly fed to me, I thought I had the answer figured out. Yet, the next clue keeps me guessing until the very end. The success of a thriller depends on the suspense and Hawkins kept the suspense at bay throughout the book. The book almost brings a rush of adrenaline to me as I read it. My mind was at a constant rush - searching for my own answers to the missing blanks.The intrigue, the near-adrenaline rush, the thrill of reading - and yet, the book did not receive 5 stars. The characters were all pathetic - sadly, it is a book that starts out with depression and ends with depression, starts with an obsession and ends with a continuance of the obsession, and revolves around a group of individuals who all had personal issues. I'm not searching for a story full of morale and heroics, but a story in which the main character is a depressed drunk throughout, who lacks any sense of common sense is not one that would warrant 5 stars."
1934,Damali,I highly recommend the audiobook.
1935,Zoe,"Men are bad. Really, there is something wrong with every single one of the,. Women too, frankly. That's the plot in a nutshell, but really, what made this Memento-esque mystery so good was that all he characters are realistically flawed, but some not as much as you think in the beginning, some more so, and the twist at the end is who falls into which of those categories. This is also a slightly more pleasant read, as the constant swearing that highlighted the tactless evil of the two protagonists in Gone Girl is lacking here. The characters in this book have a vocabulary (thank God) and each a different one in that. Subtle, engrossing, and thoroughly deserving of its popularity. I. Regards to the audio, the two main female characters were perfectly cast, and while the last reader was bit more clipped and classy than her fictional counterpart, it all balanced out to one of the better audio books of the year."
1936,J.A. Kerr,"I read this book in two days, I couldn't put it down. Paula Hawkins hooked me from the first chapter and from there, the suspense built. I did guess who dunnit in the end and there were flaws in the plot which was annoying and not believable. Overall I did enjoy it, and look forward to reading more from this author "
1937,Algernon,"Everybody Lies!It’s that kind of story, where you must be cautious of what the narrator has to tell, since he or she has a lot of secrets to hide, and tries to spin the tale in way that will gain your sympathy before you find out just how rotten he or she really is.For example, I am tempted to like Rachel, the girl who goes everyday to London from Suburbia, looking out the window and making up tales about the people she sees from the window. She’s a victim, an underdog, she’s got imagination, she’s sensitive: My mother used to tell me that I had an overactive imagination; Tom said that, too. I can’t help it. I catch sight of these discarded scraps, a dirty T-shirt or a lonesome shoe, and all I can think of is the other show and the feet that fitted into them. Her favourite fable is about a youngish couple living next to the railway. She witnesses every day their moving around their house and their tiny courtyard, and wishes she had their life. Until one day Rachel sees something she cannot put into a rosy light. Her model couple is revealed to be a fake: first she witnesses the woman kissing a stranger in full view of the strangers from the train, then she finds out from the papers that the woman has gone missing. Rachel is convinced she knows who did it, and starts to investigate the case on her own.As a private investigator Rachel is a veritable trainwreck : she’s an alcoholic who lies to her friends (view spoiler)[ she’s been fired for drinking on the ob months ago  (hide spoiler)] , she has total blackouts after she gets drunk, she’s too emotional and unstable to think rationally (view spoiler)[ she’s stalking Tom, her former husband and a neighbor of the missing woman, pretending to herself that he still loves her, despite him being remarried and a father to a little girl  (hide spoiler)]. Drunk Rachel sees no consequences, she is either excessively expansive and optimistic or wrapped up in hate. She has no past, no future. She exists purely in the moment. Drunk Rachel – wanting to be part of the story, needing a way to persuade Scott to talk to her – she lied. I lied. Rachel is not the only liar in the novel. Her journal entries alternate with two other ‘dear diary’ accounts, following slightly different timelines and used both to unmask Rachel’s fibs and to gradually reveal the secret of Megan’s disappearance. One journal is written by the missing Megan, going back one year before her vanishing act. Megan is holding back on the reader about the reasons for her pathological depression, about her betrayals and her slightly psycho personality. She uses love and sex as a means to control the men: her doting husband Scott, her therapist Dr. Kamal, (view spoiler)[ her secret third lover that got her pregnant  (hide spoiler)] . The reader is almost in a tug of war between sympathy for her plight as a do-nothing housewife and repulsion at her deviousness: I need to find something that I must do, something undeniable. I can’t do this, I can’t be just a wife. I don’t understand how anyone does it – there is literally nothing to do but wait. Wait for a man to come home and love you. Either that or look around for something to distract you. versus, I was thinking about it on the way home, and that’s the thing I like most about it, having power over someone. That’s the intoxicating thing. The third narrator is Tom’s new wife Anna, the link between Rachel and Megan (She marries Rachel’s husband, Megan babysits for her some months before she disappears). Like the other two women protagonists, Anna is not an easy person to like. She’s paranoid about her child safety (view spoiler)[ with some reason, since Rachel tried once to kidnap the kid  (hide spoiler)] , she’s extremely jealous of Tom, whose job often makes him work late, she’s vindictive and unreasonable whenever she notices Tom’s ex stalking around the neighborhood. There’s nothing so painful, so corrosive, as suspicion. ===Enough with the synopsis, I think. Superficially, given the journal type style of exposition, the missing housewife and the unreliable narrators, the look at Suburbia and the decay of social standards, the comparison with the bestseller  Gone Girl  is an obvious choice. Yet, I was definitely more invested emotionally and more convinced by the motivations of of Paula Hawkins’ characters than by the ‘glamorous’ and perverted couple in Gillian Flynn’s potboiler. The differences are subtle in the beginning, and the defining moments come late in the economy of the new novel. I know I have been using a lot of spoiler tags, but I think it will be best to explain my point of view also like this (view spoiler)[ Flynn is a showoff, her couple too contrived and too calculated in their game of oneupmanship to amke me look at them as real people instead of actors in aply. Hawkins writes deeply flawed persons, who make mistake after mistake, each and every one of them, women in the beginning, and men revealed in the later stages for the hollow shells they are. Flynn writes for the clever plot twist. Hawkins kind of points at the identity of the culprit early on in the tale, at least it was obvious to me. Flynn’s couples are concerned with power games – who dominates who. Hawkins is interested in the liberation of women – from domestic violence, from lack of horizons in a stay at home wife, from double standards in morality. All three women - Rachel, Megan and Anna - are in the beginning unpleasant, unreliable and hard to empathize with. Yet there is a reason for the way they turned out: Tom’s cheating, Dr Kamal’s unprofessional atitude towards a patient, Scott’s weakness of character. The tragic outcome is not the result of yet another timely plot twist, but a credible and sad result of years of abuse. The biggest liar in the novel and the most despicable character turns out to be not one of the three women, but Tom, who also has a native talent for sophistic untruths that justify his self-obsession: Do you have any idea how boring you became, Rachel? How ugly? Too sad to get out of bed in the morning, too tired to take a shower or wash you f—ing hair? Jesus. It’s no wonder I lost patience, is it? It’s no wonder I had to look for ways to amuse myself. You’ve no one to blame but yourself. I know which of the two tales will remain longer in my memory, and it’s not “Gone Girl  (hide spoiler)]One more reason why I prefer “The Girl on the Train” – I personally love trains, and I have on my bucket list a TransSiberian holiday. Rachel was also planning something like this: Before when I was still myself, I used to dream of taking romantic train journeys with Tom. The Bergen Line for our fifth anniversary, the Blue Train for his fortieth. Having remarked on how much I appreciated Paula Hawkins psychological insights and subtle characterization, I must confess that I also had some doubts about her style, understandable though for a debut novel:-	heavy handed hints and foreshadowing. I wish I had counted how many times I had my attention pointed at that ‘underpass by Blenheim Road’-	of the three women, Megan was the most convincing and Rachel the least. Some of Rachel’s actions may have been driven by alcohol consumption, but I believe it took her a really long time for her to read the clues.-	not much of a mystery about whodunit, but that’s OK, since the characters motivations were more interesting than the identity of the killer.-	the final confrontation was slightly forced, Hollywood thriller style. (view spoiler)[ I would have rather had less killing and a long stint in jail for the culprit. Also, Rachel dexterity with a blade felt out of character  (hide spoiler)]Anyway – recommended as a well written and deeper layered than expected psychological thriller. I would read the next Paula Hawkins novel."
1938,Hope Ortego,Video Review Coming Soon!
1939,Sara Eisenstein,"Loved this one and couldn't put it down! I don't get why all the comparisons are being made to Gone Girl. On a side note, the last three books I've read all involve sociopathic husbands who lie and cheat on their wives. It would be nice to read a book for a change where the husband is normal."
1940,Micah," Trust no one --Rachel, the girl on the train, got involved in the mystery of the missing Megan which she named ""Jess"" while watching them (Scott which she named Jason) from afar and assuming their perfect marriage life. As she looks for answers, a lot of other mysteries were also discovered including her ex-husband which is Tom and his new wife which is Anna. The book was narrated by these three women: Rachel, Anna and Megan.--Rachel is the ex-wife who lives under Cathy's roof while pretending that she has work even though she's really just broken and alcoholic and tends to forget and violent whenever she's drunk. I have my sympathy to this girl so much; she did her best to help those people even though no one believes in her, or thinks she's just having a hallucination. It's good that she did her best to finish this once and for all.Anna is really annoying but somehow I understood her, she values her family so much but at the same time I'm happy that she had a taste of her own medicine. In the end, it's great that she has awaken from her senses.Megan is a creepy woman. That's all I can say for the purpose that I don't want to spoil you.* As for the other main characters, find out for yourself guys! :)-- LIKES * The story is very interesting. I usually don't analyze stuff because I want the story to unfold by itself. Because I personally like mystery and thriller kind of books.* Although it didn't hold my attention that much because I'm still busy with other stuff, I love how it ended.* The Author was excellent in confusing the readers. You really can't judge anyone based on little and poor evidence. DISLIKES * It's really depressing but I understand it's part of the story.* The dates are really confusing or it's just me because I didn't read it in one sitting. I need to re-read some parts before I can follow with the flow. BEST LINES  I have never understood how people can blithely disregard the damage they do by following their hearts. Who was it said that following your heart is a good thing? It is pure egotism, a selfishness to conquer all.  It's impossible to resist the kindness of strangers. Someone who looks at you, who doesn't know you, who tells you it's OK, whatever you did, whatever you've done: you suffered, you hurt, you deserve forgiveness.  He smiles -- that wide, beautiful smile that used to make me melt -- and I start to sob. I can't believe it, can't believe we are brought to this, that the greatest happiness I have ever known -- my life with him -- was an illusion.  FINAL WORDS The story regarding the main characters will teach you a lot of lessons in life -- especially in the area of marriage and family. It will also teach you the consequences of alcohol and even sex addiction. I suggest that you read this book because it's wonderfully written and I don't have plans to compare it to Gone Girl. Both have their unique spots in their plots.It's a nice read."
1941,Diana Jolly,"So how many people go through life thinking so many people seem to have it together more than us? Well everyone has their skeletons, torments and sometimes unbalanced mental health... Hence this thriller that keeps you guessing who did it."
1942,Squibart,"In a fitting turn of events I am suffering a hangover today from reading this book filled with the black holes of alcohol soaked brains. You see, mine is the better type- the book hangover- earned when I have stayed up most of the night to finish a novel. I swear I do not have a problem- I can stop reading anytime I want-really. The fact that I did not want to read this overhyped book apparently did not matter because I was still drawn in by the title, the cover, the synopsis- and mostly the way it followed me everywhere I went with gratuitous advertising splattered over every book store, digital and brick walled. Was it worth it? Let's see, I got what I asked for- it was psychological, I learned much about why it is bad to slip into alcoholism, and I learned that crazy men apparently attract women like flies. This story is told in the first person perspective of three women, one drunk, one self righteous, and one with PTSD, and all are mentally unstable. The characters are not very likable, but I could not help but feel for Rachel, even though I pretty much wanted to slap her for everything decision she made. But this is a story and without obviously flawed characters where would we be? I cannot say If I was surprised or shocked with the developments, but I sure was changing my theories as I read trying to one up the author with my own twists and turns. Overall, with a one handed yawning salute I have to admit I did like it. Could I have gone to sleep and finished today? I thought I could, but I didn't- I wanted to know who did it. There it is, the truth. Now that it is over, most of the details will soon be forgotten. It is no literary masterpiece, but the author did her job and made me want to know. Should you read it? Sure- you'll love it or hate it. And you can stop anytime you want to, I promise."
1943,Karen ♐,"I enjoyed this book but I guess I expected more. It is a good thriller and has a good, satisfying conclusion. The story revolves around 3 women. Rachel, who has a drinking problem, Megan and Anna. This story is told mostly from Rachel's POV and she isn't really understood (herself included) until the end. I gave it 3.5 stars but rounded up to 4."
1944,Skip Ferderber,"This may be a first work by Ms. Hawkins but it's masterful. It's quite a trick to dislike virtually everyone in the book and yet stay in there as you get deeper into the lives of these wretched people, their lives, illusions, weaknesses and lies. And yet . . . It's quite a read: one of those compulsive reads populated with people intertwined with each other's in ways you wouldn't suspect. And even though you know when you pick up the book you know it's is actually a crime novel, you're stunned when you find out it actually is. You may look for the omnipresent, omniscient cop to solve it, but the ""detective"" may be among the most unusual characters in the annals of murder most foul. As the book dances from revelation to revelation, I found i had to stop and really think about how each character/incident related to each other: This is a book that needs to be read carefully even though it often feels as though you're trying to make sense of things after you've spent an evening being totally high and have to piece together what happened last night. But that's part of its genius. Warning: Don't look for it to mean more then a helluva good read. Sometimes books transcend the genre and give you some thought it theme to ponder over. I found none, which is why i only gave it four stars. But it is one helluva read. Highly recommended."
1945,Petra,"I am so tense. I just finished ""the Girl on the Train"" and still can't relax. Could not put this book down. Reminded me of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window."" A great psychological thriller."
1946,Jennifer Maclaughlin,I would rate 4.5 stars if I could. It was one that I wanted to get through so quickly. The story was captivating yet well paced. I was so intrigued throughout the entire book and I never thought it dragged. Plus the outcome was relatively unexpected through the course of the book until a certain point where there is some good foreshadowing. There was excellent character development although every character is an awful person. Well done and I will look for more books from the author. 
1947,Kristine,"This book was one of those I couldn't stand to put down! The story was taut and suspenseful, and kept me guessing from chapter to chapter. The narrators almost felt like people I knew personally and it made the story more vivid and real. This was way better than Gone Girl; still dark and twisty, but much more satisfying overall. I would highly recommend it to everyone!"
1948,Juli,"Definitely a good mystery/thriller book. If you don't mind waiting until the end to find out the whole story, then this is an amazing mystery. I usually hate books with more than one point of view and dates at every chapter (how are you supposed to keep everything straight?!) but in this book, the flow actually works well. Definitely recommend this read!!"
1949,Leonor,"I don't think my two opinions about this book are incompatible. In one hand I loved it and read it in 24hours because I was totally hooked. On the other hand I don't think of it as a good book. I really enjoyed reading this, I like these kind of psychological thrillers and mysteries where you have to figure out with the protagonist what's going on. Unfortunately it doesn't go beyond entertaining, it's not remotely deep, the characters are underdeveloped and the story doesn't hold well together, because of the characters (and because of the incompetence of the police who could have been waaaay more effective in this case).I don't know if I was supposed to feel sympathy for Rachel and root for her but it just didn't happen. Also, she undergoes a character transformation in record time that's is just not believable. The chapters from Megan and Anna's point of view are just there to add to the mystery and I though that was kind of a cheap shot. Would have liked to hear more about his women or not at all and let Rachel tell the story.I heard there's a movie in the making (stellar cast and all). I'm curious about it because even if I enjoyed it as a book, I pictured the movie in my head and it could be a really bad one. Let's see..."
1950,David Lawrance,"This book is basically Gone Girl as written by someone with a firmer grip on the English language than Gillian Flynn. No 35-word-long sentences or embarrassing and repeated misuses of the word ""literally"" here. Just a well-crafted thriller with a wonderfully flawed protagonist who you're never sure will overcome her personal demons until the very last page. It doesn't quite stick the landing, but for the first 90% of the book I was very, very impressed by the storytelling."
1951,Hpnyknits,"audio version. one of the narrators was so annoying, it was hard to get past that, but the story kept me going.a page turner with a strong message- stay away from alcohol and drugs, especially if you have tendencies to become addicted to them.what was curious was that none of the characters were likable! often, one finds a character, that although flawed, has other redeeming qualities.not here! and yet you can't stop reading.I guessed the story line way before the end, but it did not distract from the tension."
1952,Julia Hendon,"ReviewNarrated by three women, Rachel, Megan, and Anna, this is an enjoyably twisty thriller reminiscent of Patricia Highsmith, Agatha Christie, and Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt with a bit of gaslighting thrown in for good measure. Anna, the most stable but least likable of the trio, is married to Rachel's ex-husband Tom. Megan lives on the same street as Anna and Tom, and worked as their child minder for a time. And Rachel has a voyeuristic obsession with watching Megan and her husband Scott from the window of her commuter train. Both Rachel and Megan have reasons for their emotional fragility which evoke both sympathy and irritation, but are central to the plot which centers on the disappearance of one of the women on the night that another is in a drunken stupor and the third isn't where she said she was. Although I figured out who did it, why, and how before the end I was intrigued enough to keep listening. The three narrators who voiced each of the women were all excellent."
1953,July,"Bueno, libro finalizado. Un buen trhiller, no es de los mejores que he leído pero es muy bueno. Me sorprende que está escrito en primera persona a pesar de haber diferentes protagonistas, es por casi completo narración, aún así está recomendada su lectura. He visto que han hecho la peli, esperemos que no destrocen el libro..."
1954,Donna McCaul Thibodeau,"I liked this book a lot and that's saying something because I didn't particularly care for any of the main characters in the book. As anyone who knows me and reads my reviews, that is usually the kiss of death as far as I'm concerned. However, Ms. Hawkins writing style hooked me. This book is a fast read and I was looking forward to finding out how she was going to tie it all together. And then, in my opinion, she took the easy way out. That's when my review went from five stars to four. I'm not much at picking up on clues or figuring things out but at a pivotal place in the story, the penny dropped. Luckily, it came at least three quarters of the way through and I still wanted to see what would happen. I am looking forward to Ms. Hawkins sophomore effort."
1955,Cheryl Myer,Scary-especially for someone who has had similar experiences. Not that I personally have had.
1956,Gail,"""The Girl on the Train"" is definitely a captivating thriller. It took me a while to get into though. If I didn't know how popular it is, I would have given up after the first few chapters. Also, it felt a bit reminiscent of ""Gone Girl,"" but that may be because I don't really read thrillers. Those are the only two reasons not to give the book a full five stars though. Once I hit halfway, I couldn't put it down. Even once I knew who had done it, I had to see how it played out. Great airplane or beach read since it's all-encompassing but doesn't really leave an after effect (like obsessing over the characters, wanting to read more, needing to download a sequel, etc.). Here are two quotes I particularly liked:""[T]he sense of shame I feel about an incident is proportionate not just to the gravity of the situation, but also to the number of people who have witnessed it.""""He lay on the bed, watching me as I got dressed. He said, 'This can't happen again, Megan. You know it can't. We can't keep doing this.' And he was right, I know we can't. We shouldn't, we ought not to, but we will. It won't be the last time. He won't say no to me. I was thinking about it on the way home, and that's the thing I like most about it, having power over someone. That's the intoxicating thing."" "
1957,Cristine Braddy,One word.... Convoluted! Well-written and intriguing!!!
1958,Scott Beveridge,"Loved it! Great Read!I was immediately swept up in this book. The character development was believable and thorough. The insight into their lives was creepy and real. Real lives are messy and unhappy sometimes. I thought this book brought that to light and then preceded to twist it and distort it till you were on the edge of your seat. I was slightly disappointed with the ending,but I would totally recommend it."
1959,Stef Eleane,"Vous voulez lire un thriller, mais surtout pas avec plein de sang, de tueur en série et une multitude de corps..Alors ce roman va surement vous convenir !! Prenez un petit instant pour lire ces quelques lignes et je suis certaine que demain à la première heure vous serez chez votre libraire préféré avec le café et le nom de ce bouquin sur les lèvres.Paula Hauwkins signe un premier roman bien ficelé, qui va ,sans vous en rendre compte, vous rendre très addictif.-C'est bien gentil tout ça, mais il parle de quoi ce bouquin?Écris à la première personne, ce roman est raconté par trois femmes avec des décalages dans le temps.La première est Rachel. C'est une femme qui a presque tout perdu. Son mari, son boulot, sa sobriété. Elle s'accroche à des futilités pour tenir le coup, comme la régularité du trajet qu'elle s'impose tous les jours, cet arrêt systématique devant cette maison qui ressemble en tout point à son ancienne maison. Et ce couple, qu'elle idéalise (Megan et Scott).. Jusqu'au jour où Megan disparaît. Le problème de Rachel, ce sont les trous noirs du à l'alcool !Je ne sais pas ce que j'ai fait. Qu'est-ce que j'ai fait ? Entre dix-sept heures et vingt deux heures, qu'est-ce que j'ai fait ? Pourquoi Tom est-il parti me chercher . Qu'est-ce que j'ai fait à Anna ? Je tire la couette sur ma tête et je ferme les yeux ? Je m'imagine aller jusqu'à la maison, remonter le petit chemin qui sépare leur jardin de celui des voisins, passer par dessus la barrière en bois. Je m'imagine ouvrir la porte coulissante et entrer discrètement dans la cuisine. Anna est assise à table. Je l'attrape par derrière, je glisse une main dans ses longs cheveux blonds et je tire la tête en arrière, je la fais tomber par terre et lui éclate le crâne contre les carreaux froid du carrelage bleu.La seconde est Megan, une jeune femme dépressive, paumée. Elle cherche quelque chose qu'elle ne trouve pas dans son couple. Va t'elle nous raconter ce qui lui est arrivée ?La dernière est Anna. La voleuse de mari, celle qui vit dans l'ancienne maison de Rachel, à deux pas de chez Megan. Elle est mariée, mère d'une petite fille, mais elle s'ennuie dans son nouveau rôle de femme au foyer. Et puis, le climat à la maison n'est pas simple avec l'ex qui téléphone à tout bout de champs ..L'auteur a cette intelligence de savoir prendre son temps afin que nous nous attachions à tous les personnages. Si bien que nous savons que tous sont des tueurs potentiels mais cela nous fait mal de douter d'eux !Je terminerai juste par cette citation qui est une vérité et qui prend tout son ampleur dans ce roman L'homme est parfois assez fou pour préférer le chagrin à l'oubli. ( Maurice Chapelan) Lisez ce roman !!! je n'ai rien d'autres à ajouter :)http://lesciblesdunelectriceavisee.bl..."
1960,Annette,"A good read!Suspensful, and full of little twists and turns. Rachel rides the train every morning and stops at a switching station where she gazes upon the inhabitants of the houses along the tracks. She fantasizes about the life of one couple she sees everyday, until one day she sees the woman in the paper as a missing person.I don't want to give things away but Rachel, Megan, and Anna are all interesting and complex female characters. The story is believable and filled with subtle complexities."
1961,Gracey,"The ""Gone Girl"" comparisons almost turned me off of reading this book as I wasn't much of a fan of that book. Happily, the only way this book is like Gone Girl is that it's a pretty good mystery written by a woman. Oh, and, I guess a woman disappears. But, I liked this book much better. I thought the mystery was wonderful; it took me until the last 75 pages to guess the twist. And I still couldn't put it down. Oh, there was one other similarity to Gone Girl; everyone in this book is pretty terrible. There is no clear protagonist & a LOT of antagonists. If that bothers you, you may not like this book much, but I thought it was a great read."
1962,Alicia Marie," ""Blackouts happen, and it isn't just a matter of being a bit hazy about getting home from the club... Tom bought me a book about it. Not very romantic, but he was tired of listening to me tell him how sorry I was in the morning when I didn't even know what I was sorry for. I think he wanted me to see the damage I was doing, the kind of things I was capable of..."" ~Rachel Soooo... I was so excited to read this book. I downloaded the ebook the morning it was released. It is a very emotional thriller. Not fast paced by any means. But it was so emotional and raw that I was sucked in. I finished it in less than 2 days. I have honestly never read a book where I despised every character, yet kept wanting to read more. Very well written, so full of raw emotions, and pure craziness. Every chapter revealed a new piece of the story that sucked me in further. This book is written in alternating characters on alternating dates. Often I had to scroll back to the beginning of the chapter and make Kindle notes to keep track of who was telling the story and when. With each chapter the author slowly doles out more clues to the crime from different character perspectives. Therefore my perception of character personalities and what I thought happened changed after nearly every new chapter.  I don't want to give away the ending, but let me just say it was the reason this wasn't a 5 star book. Granted, I didn't figure out ""who did it"" until about 3/4 of the way through, but it was the last couple chapters that just seemed so ""blah"". For a slow paced thriller the finale happened in such a huge rush. I actually had to re-read the last few chapters thinking I missed something. I am looking forward to reading another book from this author in the future though.  I feel like I should also add that I never finished reading Gone Girl. I tried multiple times but found it too dull and boring. The reviews I've read online often compare this book to Gone Girl. This book was of course better because I finished and I finished it fast!"
1963,Maggie,"I love when I'm surprised by the ending of a thriller/murder mystery, and The Girl on the Train was one of those stories. It's also been unusual lately for me to read a novel without skimming over parts and becoming bored, but I found myself going to bed early so I could read this book - and reading it until much too late. That said, The Girl on the Train is not a cheery or uplifting novel. Many have compared it to Gone Girl and the movie Rear Window. I can see why. As in Gone Girl, it was difficult to like the characters (although I did root for poor Rachel), and TGOTT contained the voyeurism and psychological suspense of Hitchcock's Rear Window. I'm not sure if I'd want to see the movie (I understand DreamWorks has picked it up) unless it is done ""Hitchcock-style"" rather than as a sappy melodrama.I'm glad I read it, but my next read will be something more inspirational and enriching."
1964,Sandra Danby,"This book has been hyped much in the pre-publicity and I can understand why. After a slowish start, I finished it at a sprint and rarely put it down. The girl on the train is a voyeur, she watches people in their houses. On her morning commute, her train regularly stops at a red light and she looks at a house and ponders the perfect life of the people who live there. She is fantasising, you think, and then you realise she isn’t. She knows the people. Or does she?You never know where you are with Rachel’s account of what happens, she is the ultimate unreliable narrator. The problem is she is a drunk, a falling-over, hungover woman who swigs alcohol on the train and suffers memory blackouts. At no point do you know whether to believe her version of the truth. She says, “I wonder where it started, my decline; I wonder at what point I could have halted it.” In contrast to Rachel, there is Megan, the woman who lives in the house by the railway. She seems a more reliable source of information, or is she? She is unhappy too and we are uncertain why. Dissatisfied - with her marriage, her life? - she goes to see a counsellor. She hints about ‘betrayals’.For the first half of the book I got the two women slightly confused, not their current life but their back stories. Then a third female voice is added, Anna. Anna was clear to me from the beginning, and her viewpoint adds clarity to the wider picture.This is a thriller about men, as seen by women; about relationships, as seen by women; about truth and lies, and our ability to recognise one from the other.A great debut."
1965,Ricardo Costa,"He who never took a peek into somebody else window, throw the first rock. :)Good characters and a good story, that lets you go inside of Rachel's head, understanding the drama of her life.Inspite off that, it's not as good as Peter May's The Blackhouse."
1966,Mirayda,"Bi dahakine hatırlatın da gece gece polisiye, gerilim tarzı kitaplar okumayım"
1967,Dillwynia Peter,"This one of those books where I didn't particularly warm to any of the characters, but easily journeyed through as a result of the narrative.I enjoyed the three voices that make up this story, but also hate the current trend of 1st person narrative, even when the person is dead & thus could not have written what is read. Rachel's constant ""Sorry"" grated as the story progressed - they were just words, with no meaning or contrition. Seeing how other's saw her - especially the police - as a result of her being a drunk was interesting. So- you are an unreliable witness if you aren't a pillar of society with no vices. I much rather see them, then the suppressed ones you are hiding. Anna is a right bitch & scarily obsessive. I'm glad she wasn't my mother - I am aware she was ""normal"" when regarding parenting, but I thought of her as controlling and in need of psychiatric help. It was interesting how the police treated Anna in contrast with Rachel. Megan was at least honest with her faults.It is a great mystery; I worked out the solution 2 CDs from the end, but enjoyed watching it unfold to it's twisty conclusion. Unlike other new novels of this ilk that have been hyped to a ridiculous level, there is some substance to this novel with only minimal editorial errors."
1968,Irene McKenna,"This is a well-written, engaging whodunnit with a compelling, flawed protagonist. As I got closer to the end of the novel, I didn't want to put it down.My full review is here: http://mysteriousbibliophile.blogspot..."
1969,David Stone,"From the get go, a palpable emotional energy exudes from this novel; you feel yourself sitting next to “The Girl on the Train”, Rachel, she's narrating to you, pointing out what she sees on her daily commute to and from London. You’re looking over her shoulder, focusing on landmarks outside the moving train window, trying to see what she's straining to see in a residential neighborhood located just beyond the train's tracks. You can smell her booze soured sweat as you lean towards her, trying not to jostle her alcoholic beverage, a commuting home indulgence that's become too habitual. You know you’re going to shadow this woman for the duration of the story…the character of Rachel has hooked you…author Paula Hawkins has hooked you. Some reviewers complain that the plot pushes the limits of credibility. Well, all I can say is, ""IT'S FICTION...IT'S A MYSTERY STORY!"". So, get a grip, The Girl on the Train is no less believable than any tale or movie script that Alfred Hitchcock managed to churn out. To me, the sign of a good book is how easily your find yourself surrendering to the story; Ms. Hawkins captured my interest without extraneous preamble, she didn’t make me wait unnecessarily to board the train, she didn’t tease me…the story started off at a fast pace, and didn’t slacken.I can get lost in a book, and nothing else matters…the dishes can wait, I’ll return phone calls and emails tomorrow, I'll give the dog a quick walk, and I'll don my “Do Not Disturb” facial expression; I’ll read on, ripping through the pages until I know how the book ends...I needed to know how The Girl on the Train ended.Job well done, Ms. Hawkins."
1970,Ashleigh,"Great read. Sometimes not a fan of perspective and setting shifts in fiction, but this one played out well. "
1971,Kelly Bules,"I really enjoyed this. A good mystery with a lot of not entirely surprising twists. It revolves around some seriously flawed people who make a number of poor choices, but I felt for Rachel and Meghan. There was a part when I thought aloud, ""I don't particularly like anyone in this story."" But I still wanted to know what happened. The audiobook is performed by three different people, and the reader for Meghan was perfect. She made her real to me.It's not great literature. But it's a quick and suspenseful read. Great story."
1972,Kim Pocock,"When I finished, I felt it deserved four stars...so that's what I'm going with. However, the longer I sit on reviewing, the less sure I am. The beginning was slow and I had to push through a bit to become interested. I won't go into specifics as to avoid spoilers, but I knew what was going on from very early in the book. Maybe that took some of the fun out of it for me, but there seemed to be lots of not so subtle hints dropped. I liked the characters of both Rachel and Megan, despite the messes they turned out to be. Although I enjoyed this one overall, I wasn't blown away.*Side note: This does not even BEGIN to compare to Gone Girl, so stop comparing them people!"
1973,V K,"Great thriller! The book is about Rachel who travels to London every day on the 8:04 am train and passes by a homes and she creates a story in her head about their lives. There is a particular home and a couple she observes more carefully and weaves a story about their lives but something happens one day and changes the way she sees people around her forever. The story deals with alcoholism, depression, extramarital affairs, lies we often tell ourselves that are not often thrown into a story so intriguing and psychologically numbing! The characters fit in and develop so well it's difficult to put the book down... 4/5"
1974,Marie Z. Johansen," 3.5 stars really.  Liked, but not loved.Since I finished reading this book I have been tryong to decide what I have to say about it. Quite a few friends recommended this book to me and, of course, I was eager to understand what all of the literary buzz was about. I almost stopped reading when I got to about page 100 at which point I was doubting my own literary choices.The book focuses on three women, Rachel (our protagonist and struggling alcoholic), Megan and Anna (who is currently married to Rachel's ex-husband). Three men feature prominantly; Tom, Rachels's ex and Anna's current spouse, Scott (whose wife has recently been murdered) and a handsome doctor. The narrative follows each woman's point-of-view and switches time frame from pre-murder to post-murder. I found it helpful to make note of the the time references that appear at the top of each narrative section. I did not find the book depressing which I think I have read some reviewers mention. Unfortunately, I think many of the ""daily-life"" elements in the book are real-world happenings that Ms. Hawkins has coalesced in this psychological thrillerRachel struggles with her drinking and invents an alternate reality. She has lost her perfect home, husband and life which has exacerbated her alcoholism. Would things have been different if she had been able to conceive a child? Rachel suffers from black-outs and one of those episodes has left her questioning her partial memories...if only she could remember! She also has lost her job due to her drinking but carries on with her daily commute so that she does not have to ""fess-up"" to her job loss to her flat-mate, Cathy - who has a supporting role (both literally as well as figuratively).Anna has the perfect life, husband and home that Rachel has lost. She has the baby too. Life is picture perfect - or is it?Megan has a good husband who may have a wee bit of a temper problem. Megan also hides a troubling secret. Her husband suggests that she seek professionl counseling. Enter the handsome soothing doctor.Mid-book it all began to make sense to me; I understood the lengthy preambles at this point and I even had an inkling as to ""who-dun-it"". The last chapters in the book are suspensful (even you think you know how the books ends). So......my feeling about the book? It was a good read and I am happy that I hung in and continued reading. I can see how some people refer to the book as ""Gone Girl revisited"". Was it good? A resounding ""yes""! Was it great? I am not sure about that. If you like thrillers - suspenseful, psychological thrillers - I don't think that you will go wrong in reading this book. if you find, as I did, that the beginning was/is a bit slow - keep reading. you will be glad that you did.Final thoughts? This is a good book, but I am probably not on quite the same '5 star' band-wagon that so many other reviewers and readers are."
1975,Kathy Worrell  ツ ,"I became involved in the story from the beginning. Not really hearing too much hype on this book, I didn't have a lot of high expectations. On the cover of, The Girl on the Train it says that this is a Thriller. I'd like to think of it as more as slow and simmering, working its way up to a full boil. ***Possible spoiler*****As the story worked itself up to the boiling point, I started guessing who was the killer: Scott? Kamal? Tom? Anna? Rachel? I went back and forth, Scott, Kamal, Tom, Anna, Rachel. ScottKamalTomAnnaRachel.....over and over...until I couldn't really decide. The ending was a little chase, a little drama, a little excitement....finally reaching the conclusion. I kind of wish it would have ended a little differently, but the tale along the way was fun! I enjoyed the book. "
1976,Rab Araujo,"Vaya vaya vaya...Este si que es un libro escrito de manera interesante y un tanto creativa. Debo admitir que hace mucho que no me divertía tanto leyendo el punto de vista de puras mujeres con problemas serios (que a veces odié y a veces adoré). La chica del Tren es un viaje inesperado y agradable, si es que te gusta pasar medio libro preguntandote cosas y llegando a conclusiónes apresuradas. Maldigo a mi mente detectivesca, siempre me mete en apuros y me obliga a apresurar la lectura para comprobar mis múltiples teorías.Lospersonajes son originales y sesienten realmente con vida, algo que es buenoconsiderando que todo es un gran Thriller lleno de emoción. A veces dudo sobre este tipo de libros amados por tanta gente en tan poco tiempo, pero este es uno de los que lo merecen. Interesantede principio a fin. Gran historia."
1977,Tim Moravec,Well written thriller book. You want to know how it ends. You stay up too late at night turning pages to get to the end. This book was recommended to me because I read Gone Girl. This book is better than that one. 
1978,Sandra,"Really enjoyed this book- a great thriller that kept me on the edge of my seat! It's books like this that keep me with a book at all times. I think Gone Girl created a new genre of books (via Gillian Flynn). Much like western films are actually allegories for war trauma, I feel these ""thrillers with a twist"" are allegories for issues commonly experienced by women. Gone Girl addresses the kind of ""manic pixie dream girl"" expectations set out by society for basically looking like a super model, but being a combination of both mother & waitress to men (thank you Joan from Mad Men for the comparison!). The double standard is then imposed when a man can ""let himself go"" and still manage to bang a girl almost half his age. In this book, I think there is a slight undercurrent, reviewing the power that men have over women. Each woman experiences some form of domestic violence. At no time are Rachel, Anna, or Megan in a place where they feel comfortable challenging the notions put forward by their husbands. That is, until a girl like Megan goes missing. So, too, does the author conquer alcoholism, in a way which leaves someone feeling both sympathetic and repulsed by Rachel (much in the way she feels towards herself). Perhaps neither of these points were at all intentional themes set out by the writers, but I am enjoying this new wave of fiction. "
1979,Indrani Sen,I loved the book and the characters. A superb thriller after a while. I saw this being heralded as the next Gone Girl. However I liked this one more.
1980,Hilary Mortz,"This is a very clever book. If you have ever woken up wondering what you did the night before you will instantly identify with Rachel, the Girl on the a Train. Yes, she's an alcoholic, her life is a mess and she is living in a dream world grieving for the loss of the fairytale marriage she thinks she has ruined with her drinking and her general unworthiness but is that really the case? She spends her days pretending to go to the job she was sacked from and transferring her romantic daydreams onto the life of a young couple who live in a house just like she used to have when she was happily married. But then the fantasy couple become real people to her when the wife goes missing. Rachel is convinced she knows what happened to her but she was too drunk to remember if she was involved or what she saw. She is dismissed as an 'unreliable witness' but she sets out to discover the truth, however painful it is going to be for her. There are no two dimensional characters in this book, no black and white, just a gradual revelation of their deep hidden secrets in a very true to life manner. These could be your own friends or neighbours. Suspend judgement and enjoy to the last very satisfying page. "
1981,Brooke Grider,"Great bookEnjoyed the book. I loved that I couldn't put it down, but ending was a bit of a disappointment. Otherwise would have given 5 stars"
1982,Mairead,"This book was a book like no other i've read before. I am a eighteen year old girl with a lot of energy who rarely likes to sit down and do something for a long period of time. I normally read sappy romance novels that include an infinite amount of cliches. This book was a thriller, not too scary (i'm a big scaredy-cat), but very suspenseful. Before I began reading the book I read a quote saying something along the lines of ""the novel that will make you look at people differently,"" which i thought was not likely or true. However, the book was very eye opening, and speaks to the truth of trustworthiness in this world and how rare it truly is.I liked that there were three girl narrators at different times, so as readers we received numerous points of view. My only complaint with this novel is that it lacked dialogue, a majority of the text was narration, which is key for a novel like this, however it made it more difficult to read. All in all, a book i would recumbent "
1983,Vicki,"Boy, talk about your unreliable narrators! Rachel rides the train every day to and from London and over time she imagines lives for a couple she frequently sees on her journey. Then one day she sees the woman with another man and the next day she learns that the woman is missing, feared dead. Can Rachel help the investigation or hinder it by telling authorities what she saw -- or thought she saw? While Rachel is the primary narrator, there are two others. Even if you don't particularly like any of them, the story draws you in and keep you turning the pages faster and faster as you try to figure out what really happened."
1984,Kari Webb,"It took me awhile to get into this book - much like with Gone Girl. That being said, once I was hooked - I was hooked! I loved trying to figure out ""who done it"" while the twists and turns unfolded. "
1985,Bethany,"It was not the absolute best book I've ever read, but it was definitely one that I could not put down. I was very intrigued by all of the characters, and the author kept leaving me at the end of each chapter wanting to know more about each character. It was also an interesting look into what it's like in the day of an alcoholic. She did so much self-shaming, and hated herself for her weakness, but she was so caught up in the cycle that she couldn't stop. Some say that this book was predictable, but I disagree. There were many possible predictable outcomes, but I couldn't pin down any one of them for sure. I thought the author did a great job keeping the reader guessing until the end."
1986,Rebecca Barber,"This book gripped me. I was on holiday at the time and I think I read it in a day - I could not put it down. I found myself empathizing with Rachel, but also found her incredibly frustrating, and I thought the characters were well rendered. The twist was ultimately great because of Rachel's perspective, and the unreliability of her narration, though I often wondered how on earth she managed to afford the train journey every day - or anything for that matter - but the ending was shocking to the point where I wasn't quite sure I believed it, as I don't think we got to know Anna enough to make it believable. Having read Gone Girl, which everyone wants to compare this to, I don't believe it was quite as shocking and engaging as I originally found that, and I don't think it should be compared to Gone Girl as that was much more focused in the situation and plot. This was a great read in that it was gripping, and I wanted to know what happened to the characters afterwards, and I found it very easy to imagine visually, and was exactly what I wanted at the time. "
1987,Shanna Surette,"When I saw reviews that this was one for fans of Gone Girl, I immediately wanted to throw down this novel and run far, far away! I was pleasantly surprised that this was nothing like the train wreck (no pun intended) that was Gone Girl. Comparatively, both novels featured crazy/unstable and unreliable characters. Both novels feature a number of characters who narrate the story from their point of view and something dramatic happens. This is where the comparison ends.The Girl on the Train opens with Rachel, who is a dull, depressed drunk who creates a fantasy featuring a couple she sees on her daily commute through the window of the train. One day, she witnesses an event out of the ordinary for her 'Jason and Jess'.Next, we meet Megan who is a young, newly wed and very bored, housewife. Restless, she recounts events that transpired one year before Rachel's. Then, we meet Anna who is debilitatingly paranoid and is connected to Rachel.The events that follow the scene Rachel witnesses intertwines the characters in a fast paced, intricate tale. As the story unfolded, I changed my mind on several occasions as to whom I thought was suspect."
1988,Vicky,"Ruth Rendell will always be queen of the psychological thriller for me, but this one has plenty of the same elements, character first person narrative, slowly revealed back stories, plenty of creepy dysfunction. I read it pretty much in one sitting and found it quite satisfying in the Ruth Rendell tradition."
1989,Camille,"Un thriller qu'on a du mal à lâcher une fois commencé.J'ai quand même du faire quelques pauses car Rachel, le personnage central, avait tendance à m'agacer, j'avais un peu envie de la secouer.Quelques pages avant la fin j'ai commencé à comprendre le dénouement et OH! je ne m'y attendais pas.J'ai beaucoup aimé avoir les versions des 3 filles, par contre j'étais un peu perdu dans les dates au départ. 3,5/5 livre addictif mais des personnages auxquels on a un peu du mal à s'attacher."
1990,Ana,"Update: 08/02/2015If you'd like to read this review on my blog.Rating: 4.25/5 stars.The Girl on the Train is the thrilling mystery of a woman who saw something she wasn't supposed to and was at the wrong place wrong time, or was she? Deceptions, confusion, death and more are sure to follow along, told in the voices of not one but three unreliable characters, all women.This book was difficult to put down, from the beginning to the end. It grips you close using the unknown. You just have to know what happened, is everyone ok, who is really bad and who is not what they seem.From the beginning, the book plays with the image you construct yourself of the characters, playing with your mind and trust and making you question everyone and everything. Much like a great mystery must do.The main character is Rachel, and she is just the most unreliable character you'll ever read. You can't trust her, at all, but you feel bad for her, and then think her a crazy bitch, and then not quite. In the end, you're left with a feeling that you might as well don't get close to her, even thought she's not that bad.For everyone who said that this was a creepier Gone Girl, I don't agree. I mean, there are some similarities (view spoiler)[The fact that Tom was such a psycho in disguise and the missing girl element (hide spoiler)], but really, this book is different. And at times is a little bit more unsettling than Gone Girl, but I think Gone Girl is a whole different type of fucked up.For the most part, this book was excellent, great writing, good plot line and nice twist. But the one thing I didn't like, and it's actually pretty big, is that I guessed what was happening way before the twist started to unravel. I never felt what was happening normal, so I questioned everything that the author let us know, and so I managed to figure out what was happening almost halfway through. Shame.Hence the why I put a 4.25 rating. I never go hard with books I figure out way before the big reveal, because it happens all the time. But at the same time it didn't stay with me for a long time, so I considered that as well.But do not let this discourage you, this book is a great thriller, really fucked up and nice for the mind exercise. Maybe you'll be taken aback by the ending. Who knows?I recommend this to everyone, and yes, for the ones who are looking for a Gone Girl type of book, but don't expect it to be like it. And if you're soft hearted, be careful with it."
1991,Jillian,"I listened to this on audiobook and struggled through the first half of it. The characters are not very likeable but I was hooked on the second half. I really like how it ended. We went to London over Christmas and passed a lot of the stations referenced in this book, which is always cool. I guess I am surprised that people keep comparing it to Gone Girl. Maybe because the characters are not that likeable? Other than that, I would struggle to put them in the same category. It does twist and turn but in a natural way. I'm not sure there was anything natural about Gone Girl (and I mean that in the best way possible because that was a great book). "
1992,Inês," Rachel apanha todos os dias o comboio das 8:04 para Londres. E todos os dias o comboio abranda no mesmo sítio, e Rachel pode olhar para a casa de Jason e Jess, tentando apanhar mais um momento das vidas perfeitas que Rachel imagina que tenham. Mas, de repente, Rachel vê-se enredada nas suas vidas quando Jess desaparece sem deixar rasto. Gostei imenso deste livro. Desde o início capturou-me e não me largou mais, as suas trezentas páginas voaram sob os meus olhos, mesmo sendo semana de exames. É um livro que nos traz as três perspectivas das diferentes mulheres envolvidas na história, e à medida que ia saltando de uma para outra, tinha a clara certeza de que estava a ser manipulada para me sentir de uma determinada maneira acerca de cada uma das personagens, e adorei esse sentimento. As personagens são bem construídas, marcantes, cada uma com as suas imperfeições mas muito interessantes. A única coisa que tenho a apontar ao livro é que não surpreende por aí além. Não há aquele momento em que lemos uma frase e tudo encaixa dentro da nossa mente e temos de parar de ler porque não acreditamos que tal seja possível. É um thriller mais calmo, em que aos poucos e poucos vamos pondo uma hipótese, e essa hipótese vai ganhando substância à medida que avançamos mais um capítulo, e os detalhes vão-se encaixando... Recomendo bastante esta história. É uma leitura rápida, bem escrita e interessante."
1993,Anne  (Booklady) Molinarolo,"I finished this on St. Paddy's Day and I'm still torn between 3 and 4 Stars. Paula Hawkins had me spell bound. Her writing is fierce - she certainly knows how to spend a very suspenseful tale, keeping the reader quickly turning the pages despite all of her very unlikeable characters.Rachel is Tom Watson's ex-wife. She is quite pathetic. She's a drunk and unemployed. But each morning she rides the train to London (to save face) pretending she's just another commuter. And the train always stops very near her old house where she was happy and hopeful with Tom. A few doors down live a beautiful couple that she's dubbed ""Jess and Jason."" She imagines their life together, giving them wonderful attributes and marriage. Looks can be deceiving as the real ""Jess"" - Meagan - shows us. Tom's current wife hates Rachel and truly believes that Tom's ex-wife is unstable and dangerous to her, Tom, and their baby daughter. Everything is going as smoothly as each woman's situation can go until one of them suddenly disappears. Rachel must interject herself in the investigation. After all, she's invested a year of mornings and evenings watching this woman. Bad decision, girlfriend.The story line is told from each of the three women's altering POV, and that technique is powerful and makes the novel work. As I've said there is not one redeemable or likeable character in the whole book, but the reader is also a Rachel - a voyeur of a sort like in Rear Window. Something bad has happened and we know it's coming and we can't shut our eyes. We readers must know what happened and by whose hands. "
1994,Ann,"I was surprised that my book group didn't like this book (in general) as much as I did. Yes, the characters are unlikeable, but they are just a smidge off-plumb. I got a real 'there but for the grace of God' feeling from some of the behaviors exhibited.Psychological thrillers fascinate me and Paula Hawkins knows just how to create dread and uncertainty. And how many of us have to admit to looking into windows and creating perfect lives for the inhabitants? One of the things that seemed to bother the group in general was the use of specific wording that we all recognized from an e.e. cummings poem. ""Life is not a paragraph, and death is no parenthesis."" which appears rather early in the story. Read the last two lines of the poem.since feeling (e.e. cummings)since feeling is firstwho pays any attentionto the syntax of thingswill never wholly kiss you;wholly to be a foolwhile Spring is in the worldmy blood approves,and kisses are a better fatethan wisdomlady i swear by all flowers. Don't cry- the best gesture of my brain is less thanyour eyelids' flutter which sayswe are for each other; thenlaugh, leaning back in my armsfor life's not a paragraphAnd death i think is no parenthesis"
1995,Donalyn,How do you solve a crime when every witness is unreliable or a suspect? Twisty thriller with great characters. Excellent audiobook narration. 
1996,Jörn,"Sehr schöner Thriller in einem interessanten Erzählformat. Die eigentlichen Ereignisse, als sie am Ende aufgelöst werden, sind auf ein paar Seiten erzählt, interessant ist der Weg dorthin. Rachel hat keinen Polizeihintergrund, keine übernatürliche detektivische Spürnase; sie hat nur einfach nichts besseres zu tun, als den Mord aufzuklären. Bis sie sich so tief darin verheddert, dass sie nicht mehr rauskommt. Dabei kann man kaum anders, als sie zwischendurch anzufeuern, sich zu verbessern, und ihre wiederholten Abrutscher in den Alkoholismus tun dem Leser so sehr weh, als sei man selbst einer ihre Freunde.Der Zug an sich ist ein schönes Motiv, dass sich durch das ganze Buch zieht. Mir hat es sehr gefallen."
1997,Haya Al-Thani,"4.5. Was a definite 5 but the ending fell a little flat for me. It was very, um, Hollywood? (and not unpredictable). Great book though. It's been a while since I last read a page-turner, and I don't know why but there's something about unreliable narrators that thrills me."
1998,Julie Leppert,"Hot mess of a murder mystery I like that the killer is totally someone different than you'd expect and that it is written from three perspectives. Would definitely recommend hardcover or paperback rather than kindle as the dates bounce around. It was a little hard to read about the constant drunkenness and alcoholism, and this made it a little frustrating in the first half from Rachel's perspective, because all I could think was get it together! But as someone who is trying to understand the disease of alcoholism and addiction for a family member in my own life it was helpful to sort of see their struggles, self-loathing, and first hand disease. It sets the book up brilliantly as to how/why the killer did what he did. Excited to discuss at book club. "
1999,Sina,"Rachel fährt jeden Morgen mit dem 8.04 Uhr Zug nach London. Dieser hält immer an der gleichen Stelle und Rachel kann in die Gärten der umliegenden Häuser sehen. Dort sieht sie ein Pärchen, bei welchem sie sich vorstellt, dass sie das perfekte Leben führen. Sie nennt sie Jess und Jason.Eines Morgens sieht sie jedoch etwas, dass das „perfekte Leben“ von Jess und Jason auf den Kopf stellt und kurz darauf liest Rachel in der Zeitung, dass „Jess“ verschwunden ist.Rachel geht zur Polizei, meldet dort, was sie am Morgen gesehen hat und merkt dabei, dass sie wahrscheinlich mit dem Verschwinden von Jess zu tun hat.Das Buch wird aus Sicht von drei Frauen erzählt. Hauptsächlich kommt Rachel zu Wort, die mit ihren detaillierten Angaben ihre Tage wiedergibt.Zwischendrin melden sich Megan und Anna zu Wort.Alle drei Frauen haben Probleme. Allen voran Rachel, die – verlassen vom Ehemann, alkoholabhängig und arbeitslos – jeden Tag mit dem Zug nach London fährt, weil sie es eben noch von ihrem früheren Leben so gewohnt ist. Ihre Beobachtungen führen dazu, dass sie über ihr Leben nachdenkt, sich fest vornimmt, einiges zu ändern, aber mit der Gesamtsituation einfach noch überfordert ist.Die Autorin schildert auf dringliche Weise, wie sehr Rachel immer weiter abrutscht, bis sie durch eine Beobachtung feststellt, dass es sich lohnt, wieder für etwas zu kämpfen.Es ist ein ständiges Auf und Ab, und man möchte Rachel erst in den Arm nehmen und sie trösten, andererseits möchte man sie schütteln, damit sie endlich zur Vernunft kommt. Sie tat mir so unendlich leid, wie sie sich quälte.Der Schreibstil der Autorin ist fesselnd. Nicht etwa, weil sie einen Spannungsbogen aufbaut, sondern weil sie es fertig bringt, sich in die Protagonisten hineinzuversetzen. So konnte ich mit Rachel mitfühlen, Annas Verhalten nachempfinden und auch Megans Seite verstehen. Schonungslos gibt die Autorin Einblick in die kaputten Leben und lässt dabei meist sehr tief in seelische Abgründe blicken.Wie sich letztendlich alles zusammenfügt ist in meinem Augen sehr gut gelungen, obwohl ich schon ziemlich früh eine Ahnung hatte, wie es wohl ausgehen wird bzw. wer hinter allem steckt.Gerade durch die leise Gangart der Autorin wird die Geschichte zu etwas Besonderem und deshalb kann ich den Hype um dieses Buch dann doch verstehen. Ich wurde selbst davon in den Bann gezogen.Die Filmrechte an dem Buch sind schon verkauft und ich bin gespannt, wie die Story dann auf der Leinwand wirkt. In gedruckter Form konnte sie mich auf alle Fälle schon mal überzeugen und ich werden mir Paula Hawkins definitiv mal merken.Fazit:Kaputte Protagonisten, kaputte Story – definitv etwas, das man gelesen haben sollte."
2000,Jonas Heide,"An excellent premise, and the author has a great eye for human weakness. The world's most unglamorous detective makes for interesting story dynamics. The language is straight-forward and the environment is only roughly described but on the whole a clever page-turner that feels nicely different."
2001,Karlan, The popular thriller is exciting with some slow parts which seem repetitious but serve to introduce small clues. It reminded me of Ruth Rendell's psychological puzzles.
2002,Ashok Banker,"One of the best mysteries of the year and one of the all-time bests. All the reviews say everything there is to say. It's not just 'the next Gone Girl', it's much better in my opinion. Shades of Christopher Nolan's 'Memento'. Brilliantly written Hitchcockian murder mystery with corkscrew twists throughout and a final twist at the very end. Read it!"
2003,Danielle Smith,"OK, so I’m a little late to the game with reading this book. It’s been on my TBR list for some time and when I received it as a birthday present last week, I felt like I should promote it to the top of the pile as a thank you.This bestseller is Paula Hawkins’ first dip into the psychological thriller genre of fiction, although she is by no means a newcomer to writing, having been a journalist and writer of finance and business before moving on to writing romantic comedy fiction under the name Amy Silver, writing four novels including Confessions of a Reluctant Recessionista.The Girl On The Train is an entirely darker direction.I’ll try to keep the plot spoiler-free. Written in a first-person narrative from the perspectives of Rachel (the main focus character) and Megan and Anna; whose lives and stories become interwoven in an interesting and compelling way.Set in and around the London area in 2012/2013, the author structures the narratives in sections of specific dates (usually further still by sections of morning/evening) and the story becomes even more interesting to read when the timelines of the characters fall out of sync with each other.Hawkins’ really pulls off these characters in terms of relate-ability; Rachel is not just the cliché flawed and damaged divorcee - she is a total disaster, with no faith in herself - and her endless procrastination spoke volumes to me! Megan/Jess and Anna also have anxieties hiding just under the surface that a lot of women will relate to; but this book also touches on the darker sides of emotional abuse, domestic violence and substance abuse and whether directly relate-able or not, these grittier themes captured from a first person perspective really draw the reader in.The Girl On The Train is a psychological thriller and does the genre proud. It is reminiscent of Gone Girl or Before I Go To Sleep but still holds its own in a vastly saturated market of similar titles.At 320 pages long, this book is structured well and brings enough pace to keep the pages turning, I read this in pretty much one sitting and really enjoyed doing so.As with many bestsellers nowadays, this book is being made into a movie, the rights acquired by Dreamworks, and is scheduled for release October 2016, so I would recommend reading this book before the film comes out as there will be inevitable changes - it has already been confirmed to be in New York rather than London.All in all, a good thriller with an interesting plot full of suspense and rich characters. If this is Paula Hawkins' first entry in to the genre then I'm excited to read what she does next."
2004,Polly Watson,"I don't know which is more exhilarating for me....to guess the ""who done it"" before the ending of a book or NOT to guess correctly!!!! I thought I had it right. I really and truly thought I knew SHE ""did it,"" but wonderfully, surprisingly, I was VERY wrong!!! Ahaha!!! Way to go, Paula Hawkins! Over the past several months, THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN has continually shown up in my Nook ""to read"" folder and in my Amazon Kindle ""to read"" folder as well. It seemed that I just could not ignore or get away from this book. Curiosity won. And I'm glad it did. This is a wonderful book about first impressions as well as about LIFE and how quickly life can--and quite often does--get out of control for ANYONE and EVERYONE. I see as I look at websites for TRAIN that GONE GIRL is quite often compared to it. I get that. If you have read GONE GIRL, I can assure you that THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN by Paula Hawkins is even more worth reading. I love the twists and turns and reveals that happen slowly, subtlety, and always at just the right moment to keep me reading and wanting to know more about each of the various characters in the story. This amazing story that Paula Hawkins has written takes a hard, very honest look at the difficulty each of us faces on a day-to-day basis and how we cope with those difficulties--with fore-thought and without.I can't say enough good things about THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN by Paula Hawkins. I certainly will be looking into other books by her!!! It is an adult novel, though, so just keep that in mind, parents, if your teens are reading it. I would be sure to read it with them or at least stay connected with them as they read it....I'm just sayin'."
2005,Jennifer Phelps,"From start to finish there was something off, something left of center... but in the right way. The characters, setting, dialogue all seemed at once harsh and dreamlike as if you were having one of those wacky dreams that seem so real it takes you a few minutes after waking to realize it was just a dream. I like the constant second guessing of the characters, the constant nagging in the back of your mind that you were missing something. You had to stay alert and hang on for the ride. The Girl on the Train kept me on my toes and reading late into the night. "
2006,Srikumar Krishna Iyer,"Well it turned out to be one hell of a page-turner. Told from multiple character perspective (which has been a style offlate...), one cannot put it down once you pick it up for reading. Language is decent, not much harsh stuff or obscene prose (except in few instances where the situation demands), suitable for all ages.(view spoiler)[The story is told from the perspective of different characters in the plot, namely Rachel, Megan, Anna. Rachel is the 'girl' on the train or rather in the train who watches the houses along the tracks. especially the one near the signal where the train stops by everytime briefly, enabling Rachel to watch that particular house more closely.She becomes obsessed with the occupants of the house and also starts observing their activities and their daily routines. One day she notices that the girl has invited a stranger to her house and seems to her like she is having an affair. After a few days she is able to relate a news item concerning the disappearance of a girl, with this house that she observes from time. She also learns the actual names of the house occupants from the news article.From here the plots turns very interesting as Rachel tries to help the police to unravel the mystery of the missing girl. The police refuse to believe her due to her drinking habits, but she pursues further and tries to help Scott, who is the husband of the girl who went missing, Megan. Initially he belives her but gives up after sometime as Rachel is unable to remember everything that happened on the night of the disappearance of Megan, when she had also visited her ex-husband Tom's to patch up for her past mistakes. Meanwhile Rachel looses her job is takes up to drinking and parallely runs around trying to solve the mystery. (hide spoiler)]Loved the ending when different narrators close in on the day of the murder and pin down the culprit.I recommend this book to anybody who loves a good who-dun-it Novel."
2007,Cărți și călătorii,"Ingredientele acestei rețete de succes sunt: un personaj destul de instabil emoțional, o poveste imaginată, o crimă, mai mulți suspecți, inclusiv Rachel a noastră, secrete și minciuni, lupte interioare, sentimente puternice și contradictorii și curiozitate până la final.Scriitoarea te pune pe câteva piste false, îți dă unele indicii ce se dovedesc esențiale mai târziu, te face să empatizezi cu personajele, dar și să le suspectezi în același timp, totul e un joc de intuiție pentru tine, dar o chestiune de viață și de moarte pentru ele. Structura romanului e caleidoscopică: parcă te-ai uita în mai multe oglinzi, fiecare arătând altceva. Cele trei naratoare – Rachel, Anna și Megan – își spun poveștile, care se suprapun pe alocuri, dar rămân mereu întrebări fără răspuns până în a doua jumătate a cărții, când lucrurile încep să se lege suficient cât să intuiești vinovatul.Să nu credeți că e „doar” un roman polițist și că accentul se pune numai pe găsirea criminalului. Analiza psihologică este foarte fină, iar comportamentele descrise foarte realist. Asistăm la deznădejdea unui om care a pierdut totul din cauza alcoolului, la lupta dificilă cu dependența, la desele recidive și amânări, la pierderile de memorie și rușinea de după, la pierderea încrederii în sine și hotărârea de recâștigare a ei; pe de altă parte, suntem martori la momente de violență și gelozie, la minciuni și înșelăciuni, la clipe de teamă și singurătate.Recenzia întreagă: http://mihaelaburuiana.com/cartisical..."
2008,Jennifer Lara,"The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins is a mystery story told through the eyes of a lonely and recovering alcoholic, Rachel Watson, as she sees something while waiting on the train headed into London. She doesn’t know if what she saw was real but she must find out. Rachel Watson rides the morning train into London. While the train stops at a light, she imagines the life of a young couple she calls “Jason” and “Jess.” She can see their house from her favorite seat. Until one morning she sees “Jess” with another man. She is hurt that “Jess” would do that to “Jason” and she relives her own jilted relationship. When “Jess,” whose real name is Megan, goes missing, Rachel feels she must tell the police what she saw. When she feel the police don’t give her information any real attention, she feels she must find out on her own. Will her sordid past be stacked against her? Will she ever happen to Megan? Can she trust her own eyes and memory in the events of Megan’s disappearance?The story is told in three perspective, offering events in various points of the timeline. Rachel’s perspective as the current events while Megan provides the events leading up to her disappearance. I thought the book started out real slow and I was wondering what did Rachel really see or was it her alcohol fueled imagination. But the story speeds up quickly and the events leading to the identity of the person who was responsible for Megan’s disappearance happens at a dizzying pace. There was a couple times when I had to stop and go back a couple of pages to make sure I read it correctly. By the end of the book, I was thoroughly shocked and thrilled at the revelation of the person’s identity. I love a mystery in which the clues are subtle but when the dots are connected, they all make sense. I recommend The Girl on the Train as mystery thriller with so many twists, the final revelation is a shocker! "
2009,Becky,"Started out dark and depressing, but I am glad I stuck with it. Good psychological thriller involving the dysfunctional lives of three women and the men in their lives.."
2010,Kathleen Nightingale,"I really debated between ""liked it"" and ""really liked it"" on the rating scheme. What did it for me was Hawkins portrayal of Rachel and her alcoholism. Like others have stated the characters portrayed in this book were a hot mess. Yes, a true statement, they all were, but don't we all have bits and pieces of our past which we unfortunately remember? Some pieces are more significant than others and in the majority of cases are moral issues. Hawkins was bang on, even down to the blackouts many experience from excess alcohol use. Some reviews have found Hawkins characters desperate. I agree to some extend but having witnessed loved us cheat and be cheated on and I continually ask why, I have experienced alcoholism and blackouts first hand. The only experience I have personally missed in this book was the lying psychopath. Like others, I had pretty much figured out who the real killer was but I didn't know why until I continued reading. Some compare this book to Gone Girl, thankfully, this was not the case. It takes a really long time to forget turning the page to 182 of Flynn's book and I was so glad Hawkins did not do this with this book. I'm really glad I read it as the only reason I picked it up in the first place was because I was seeing it everywhere."
2011,Amanda Bolderston,"A great twisty-turny read....well plotted and fast paced. The Guardian review of The Girl on the Train described it as ""amnesia lit"" - apparently a new trend where the main character is unreliable, or pieces of the narrative are missing. Think Gone Girl, As I Go to Sleep or How to be a Good Wife. Rachel, the main character, may have witnessed evidence in a possible murder case from her regular commuter train, but she's also a liar, a drunk and prone to blackouts. The interesting part is that pretty much all of the other players in the story are cheats, psychos and about as untrustworthy as they come. Have fun working this one out!"
2012,Nate,"I had to read one of the most talked about books of 2015. The story reminded me of Gone Girl with many surprising twists and turns. The ending surprised me a little and kept me up the night I read it. While I am not sure I would read another book by this author (as I am slightly tired of the Gone Girl genre), I enjoyed it and it kept me reading. One thing I really enjoyed was that I am a train commuter daily and understood the setting well and seeing people sometimes the same ones daily. It can unnerve you a little."
2013,Christy,I really enjoyed this book. 4 stars instead of 5 because of bad language in the book.
2014,Carol Hubbard,"Although, the characters were not particularly likable I enjoyed the book a lot."
2015,Eddie Callaway,"Quite a few interesting characters . . . I like how Rachel's jumbled memories made the story feel more confusing. Tom is certainly such a piece of trash that he is easily disliked (I mean, really no good quality about him whatsoever; Scott not much better).I love trains in stories because there are so many motifs that can be used with them. I found it interesting how Meagan kept longing to take the trains to somewhere, anywhere, like they could take her to all the best places in the world. But in reality, trains can only take you to predetermined places, and often places that aren't really that great.I was definitely engaged to find out what would happen, especially near the end."
2016,Marcus,"Just finished reading The Girl on the Train. It was a pretty good mystery novel, although it got a little intense at times with its depiction of alcoholism and spousal abuse. Overall I enjoyed it."
2017,Robert Roush,"Intriguing, and a bit disturbing, story. I like the staccato feel of the author's writing. The plot keeps moving and presents a series of twists which serve to emphasize the depravity of its characters. While many will feel it added to the authenticity and believability of the characters, I could have done with out the somewhat frequent cussing. I especially find this to be true when I listen to the audio-book version of a story.The quality of the reading in the Audible version of this book was excellent. I suspect I enjoyed the story more than I would have if I'd read it, due to the performance quality."
2018,Sapna,"This book reminded of Gone Girl, and I am sure it will be a movie at some point. A psychological thriller that was very engaging, told by three points of view, with an outcome that can be predicted halfway into the story. An alcoholic woman who rides the train sees something amiss and then gets involved in a missing person's case while trying to sort out her own crazy life. While all the characters were nuts, I really enjoyed reading it."
2019,Samayra,Interesting read
2020,Sandra Vaughan,"Well written, good paced drama. Good character development with very plausible characters. You can see and empathize with the situations they got themselves into and from everyone's perspective."
2021,Gina (Weena),"Wow, what a story! I was drawn in from the beginning. How could I not be, when someone is basically talking about being murdered. And then you have poor Rachel, a lonely drunkard cast out by her husband. A woman who is pretending to go to work every day so that her flat mate doesn't know that she was sacked months ago. A woman who has a fantasy about a certain couple, who happen to live just down the street from her ex-husband and his new wife. Every day around the same time, Rachel's train stops at a faulty signal light, and she gets a glimpse of this beautiful couple's life. She imagines what they might be like, what the husband does for a living, and so on. One day, she sees something that shocks her, and angers her. Soon after, that young woman is missing, and Rachel thinks she knows what's happened to her. But this story isn't going to go the way you might expect it to. Rachel is in for far more of a shock than she could ever dream. Great intensity, an intriguing mystery, and a look inside the life of an alcoholic. I could barely turn away."
2022,Almu,Me ha gustado mucho. Me ha tenido enganchada desde el principio y eso que la Rachel me ponía un poco nerviosa. Me gusta cuando lo autores van cambiando de protagonista en cada capítulo y puedes ver perspectivas diferentes.
2023,Greg,There's no putting this book down after the halfway point. What a twist! Damn.
2024,Murray Shelmerdine,"Very well written thriller, with depressingly believable portrayal of domineering men and the women who are attracted to them. Gripping narrative, satisfying conclusion."
2025,Mohbobeh,ترجمه این کتاب را شهریور ماه به پایان رساندم. کار ترجمه از زمستان سال گذشته آغاز شده بود و در عرض سه ماه به سه چاپ رسید. با توجه به رکود بازار کتاب در ایران، اقبال مردم به این کتاب تامل برانگیز است. داستان جز آن که از اِلمانهای مهیج پلیسی برای ایجاد کشش در داستان بهره می جوید، مانند دیگر داستانهای عامه پسند، ساده انگارانه از قضایا نمیگذرد و هیچ چیز را موکول تصادف و تقدیر نمیکند. ادمهای این داستان واقعی اندو انگار هزار بار در زندگی مان به چنین افرادی با مشکلاتی مشابه آدمهای این داستان برخورده ایم. یافتن دردهایی که مردم تمام جهان در آن مشترکند، باعث شده این کتاب در سراسر جهان خواننده داشته باشد و به زبانهای مختلف ترجمه شود. این کتاب را نشر میلکان منتشر کرده و کپی رایت آن را از ناشر اصلی خریده است. در ایمیلی که برای پائولاهاوکینز فرستادم، از ترجمه کتابش در ایران، ابراز خشنودی کرد. 
2026,Carmen,"I don't usually read thrillers because it gives me nightmares but I felt like I had to read this one. It was captivating and I loved how the story unraveled. Great plot twist. Though reading teasers about the ""unexpected"" plot twist made me hyper aware of all the characters and who could have done it. "
2027,Kristel,"Story of 3 women all connected to Tom in some way and set in England. This is a pretty good mystery with many twists. I listened to the audio and at first it was a little hard to get the perspective. I advise looking at the ""chapter headings"" to help. It is read by different readers for the 3 women; Megan, Rachel and Anna. "
2028,Kristen,"Really enjoyed this book. It is interesting how at the first, I thought this girl needed to get control of her life, I guess in a way, I thought she was being weak. But then you find out what has happened to her and my eyes were open. Reminds me to not judge people, you never know everything that has happened to them in their lives. "
2029,Fran Parsons,This one had me from page 1! Great fast-paced mystery! 
2030,Lolanta,https://lolantaczyta.wordpress.com/20...
2031,Sue ,"A thrilling read but the main characters are all flawed and none of them likeable. Rachel's insights are honest and it's a good study of a troubled and vulnerable person coming up with 'justifications' for her behaviour. The struggle with alcohol is well told and the downward spiral of her life quite credible. It was quite depressing that all the characters we're so self absorbed, selfish and rather one dimensional. I kind of felt they all deserved each other in a away. The main character, at her lowest, seemed oddly drawn to these people and the one person who was closet to her and showed her generosity of spirit was the one she didn't really value or respect until perhaps the end. "
2032,Alexis Schlueter,"Holy jeez.. that was a good one. SPOILERS!I rated this book 4 stars. I will rate a book 4 stars if I thoroughly enjoyed the book, but do not consider it one of my favorite books of all times. I reserve 5 stars for books that I consider my favorites. So yes, The Girl On the Train did remind me of Gone Girl in the beginning, but once you get to reading it you really forget about all of that. It has enough solid differences that gave me a more of a Hitchcock Rear Window type of vibe which I LOVED! The book focuses around the main character, Rachel, who takes the train into London every day. As she is on the train, she sees this house every day and observes the couple who live there as they enjoy breakfast, coffee, etc. As she observes the couple one day, Rachel notices something peculiar. A few day later, the wife who lives in the house, goes missing. Rachel takes this piece of information that she has discovered, and begins to try to figure out what happened to the wife. Every single character in this book is terrible. Now I don't mean that they weren't well- written, but they were just bad people. You could not trust ANYBODY in this book, which is what I liked about it. It really kept you on your toes, and hard for the reader to figure out the mystery. Lets talk just for a second about the main character Rachel. You want to love her and you want to hate her. She has been through a lot of trying times and some of those things I could personally relate to. However, how desperate and obsessive she became really turned me off from her as a character. The ending is what brought the whole book together for me. Especially the character of Anna. The whole last thirty pages, the reader has absolutely no idea what to think about Anna STILL and that was super intriguing to me. If you haven't read this book and love suspense, this is the book for you. Happy Reading! "
2033,Julie,"It's been a while since I've made so much time to read so I could finish a compelling book. I enjoyed its intriguing premise and the evolution of the character Rachel. It's pretty fast-paced, and while it doesn't have quite the twists of ""Gone Girl,"" it would appeal to readers who liked that. One question that remained: (view spoiler)[Who told the news about Megan's first child? I thought only the therapist knew about that, and I don't understand why he would tell. Did I miss something? (hide spoiler)]"
2034,Katherine Marson,"Commuting. Catching the same train everyday. The same people, the same seat, stopping at the same places. This is reality for Rachel. Staring out of the window, watching the world go by. One couple Rachel decides to call ""Jess & Jason"" she finds particularly fascinating. With their seemingly perfect life, drinking coffee in the morning and appearing totally in love. Rejected by her husband who is now married again and a father, Rachel is struggling to move on. She is a lonely character, turning to alcohol for company and desperate for some kind of affection. When she witnesses an event at the home of ""Jess & Jason"", she can't help but get involved leading to many lies and complications along the way. Anything to feel appreciated and needed. Rachel can't help wondering if she knows more than she thinks. With her ""blackouts"" from too much alcohol, she needs to work out what she really knows before it's too late. An interesting read which I enjoyed. A few twists along the way which kept me guessing. Loved the awkward commuting parts."
2035,Julia,"Reading this was a lot like ""Gone Girl"" in that it's ""an addictive read about thoroughly repellent characters."" One simply MUST know how it all turns out. There was enough tension and mystery to propel me through the book in about 36 hours. Not a perfect 5 stars because I guessed the outcome a little earlier than is ideal. I thoroughly enjoyed it though, creepy characters and all. It's a gripping summer read that hooks you and won't let you go. "
2036,Trisha,I really enjoyed the twists and turns in this thriller. The writing is great so that you can go inside the characters minds. It is a bit confusing at first with the characters since I was listening to the audio version. Each chapter is told by a different character and the dates vary. It is helpful to be able to flip through the book.
2037,Sneha,"Though the book has very slow inital pace where you might wonder if you can find a single reason to go reading book, trust me it will be soon a roller coaster ride (600+ pages, read it in 1.5 days). Paula took her own sweet time to introduce us to her characters, their thoughts, their silhouette of ugly truth & guilts. Having known them all, you'll find yourself worrying about one or the other character at some point. No big fancy words but just crude feelings, isnt that how we all think & its the simplicity that eventually wins over. Paula has really managed to balance all the equations, she has a victim for every villain & vice a versa. However, it really makes you wonder was the incident that was holding up the whole book was worth it! Given the roller coaster ride I enjoyed, I would partially settle to have such a weak core incident for such an incredibly expressed train of thoughts.P.S. I wonder if men find it excruciating to go through such minute thoughts of a woman, but yes, its partially true that we overthink up to such extents, which Paula has used amazingly to use as a factor to build interest."
2038,Peter Reid,"Fast paced and original thriller. I think the back-cover blurb mentions Hitchcock, and it did remind me of Rear Window. Interesting characters, plot twists that are actually surprising, and tight writing. Highly recommended!"
2039,Sunshine,"Hooked! Could not put this one down, it was so full of twists and turns that it keeps you guessing throughout. I finally worked it all out once I was three quarters through but I still needed to know the ending! I like how it jumps from all the female characters and goes forward and back in time so that you can put the puzzle pieces together yourself, very well written and quite looking forward to more from this author. "
2040,Mientras Leo,"Puede parecer generoso, pero me ha parecido que, una vez terminada, la novela era mejor de la impresión que me daba al leerlo.Es una historia muy muy entretenidaMás aquí"
2041,Marcia,"Quite a good psycho thriller -- I wouldn't mind a movie made from this book. Interestingly, I found the characters of Scott and Tom almost indistinguishable in terms of the physical and emotional descriptors used by the author -- while the three women were distinctively different. "
2042,Olesya,It was like swallowing the book. It took only 2 days to read so I just couldn't put it down. I wanted to know what would be there further. Very interesting and easy to read.
2043,Lynn Pribus,"Very compelling. One of those where you finish a chapter and delay lunch because you're already into the next one. Well, maybe just one more. Oh, this next one's short.There have been many comparisons to GONE GIRL, but I felt like showering after I finished that one -- two really evil people. Some not-so-nice people here, too, but they were grossly flawed rather than wicked. First person POV from three women: first wife, second wife, victim.The story of the main narrator, Rachel, seemed very like a ""qualification"" at an AA meeting and I kept hoping she'd sober up and fly right."
2044,Shannan,"Great, easy read. Very Gone Girl meets a train and an alcoholic in England. Super enjoyable. Would have preferred a less predictable ending after all of the twists and turns, but overall, highly recommend. "
2045,Jason Jauron,"I refuse to be the last person on Earth not to have read this book, so I did.I also read The Library at Mount Char at the same time.I liked this book much better.I really appreciate a protagonist that has flaws.And a drinking problem due to the collapse of a relationship is more than real.Blackouts? Super scary.The main character being a woman was somewhat of a new thing for me, but I found her sympathetic enough and I shed my sexism, eventually.Loved the train.Loved the houses.Loved the intrigue.This did not read as a first novel for me.A pleasant surprise."
2046,Noemi,"I raced through it at top speed, staying up late to read- and I have a one year old at home who still doesn't sleep through. That's worth 4 stars. "
2047,Marc Cooper,"4 stars out 4, because I only give 5 star for books I think (or know) I’ll read again. This, being a thriller, is not that type of book.I’ll lay my cards on the table. I read this wanting to understand the hype, and I fully expected to dismiss it as a potboiler. It isn’t. It’s a tightly constructed thriller with characters that are not only unreliable, but flailing about wildly all over the place. Everyone is a mess. And most are selfish in the extreme. There’s not a character in the book to sympathise with. Even the children.The telling of Rachel’s story as an alcoholic is worth 5 stars. The author never lets a symptom pass untold (to the last page). Yet the telling is also sadly touching. Alcoholics are almost universally painted as repulsive and weak, in both film and on the page, but here the author relates the emotions behind every drink and every drunk. Rachel might be an alcoholic, and she might be overusing alcohol as a crutch, but it’s not hard to understand why she behaves as she does. You don’t have to sympathise with her, but you can understand her behaviour if you put yourself in her shoes.The book isn’t perfect, of course. I started to drum my fingers about halfway through, then almost immediately the author introduced something so unexpected that I had to put the book down to assimilate it. And there is an amnesia event (in all but name) that is believable, but convenient to the plot. But these are picky gripes that in no way spoiled my enjoyment.If you want a dark thriller for a train ride or a flight, look no further. It’s not going to change your life, but it will entertain you (as a book should) if you go in with your eyes open about what type of book it is: a dark thriller."
2048,Roufida,"""what did just happen?"" is the question I asked myself when I finished it at 6 am. I love this book, not even like it, I LOVE it! "
2049,Casey Thaler,Very easy book to read and very quick. I just wasn't in love with the story. None of the characters were particularly good or heroic. Meh. I want something that blows me away! 
2050,Kozie,"If you want to read a good review of this book, I suggest Wendy Darling's. I will share my thoughts, however. I read a lot of mysteries, including short stories in Ellery Queen Magazine monthly. Hawkins first mystery was one I couldn't put down. A modern Agatha Christie, I'd say. Interesting characters, plenty of convincing red herrings, and a good story.  One thing, Wendy Darling, and others, have said the characters were ""terrible"" people. I don't think so. The reader gets to see beyond the public face these characters show. It could be a lesson for all of us, to understand the potential of all human beings to be cruel, even to commit murder. YOU think you're ""kind"", would ""never""? You have no facets of yourself that you don't reveal deliberately? Even the roommate, Cathy, who seems to show the most compassion, is not always kind; and, in fact, her kindness looks a lot like codependency, and is, therefore, withdrawn when her expectations of Rachel are not met.  I, like my favored reviewer, Darling, also, figured out who the murderer was -- I even felt a bit of a let down that it didn't turn out to be someone I hadn't even considered. But, on further reflection, I realized, had it been any of the other characters who acted as red herrings, I would have thought ""I knew it"". Had some character out of left field done it, one not so developed as the others, perhaps, I know that kind of outcome is always a huge disappointment. The truth is, I couldn't quit turning the pages, because I DIDN'T know whodunnit! "
2051,H.M,"Simply put, this was a fantastic read from debut author Paula Hawkins. Unreliable narrators, twists and a fast pace guaranteed that.This story is, at the beginning, about Rachel who takes the same train every morning. As she continues down the track, she passes the same stretch of houses each day and as the train slows, she watches a couple going about their daily lives. She’s began to feel as if she knows them and has even created fictional names and scenarios for them. Then one day, watching them from her seat on the train as usual, she see’s something that shocks her and changes everything. Unable to keep it to herself, she tells the police and becomes entwined in what follows and the lives of those involved. It’s impossible to tell you anymore without giving something away and this is a book it’s best to know as little as you can about before reading.Inevitably, there have been numerous comparisons to Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn. It feels like nearly every thriller with an unreliable narrator is! Like Gone Girl, I rushed through this book and clique or not, was hardly able to set it down, which hardly ever happens. For me though, that’s where the comparison ended. Gone Girl felt much more convoluted, so I really appreciated the straightforwardness of this.This book gets going almost immediately and doesn’t take long to pull you in. It’s narrated by three woman- Rachel, who narrates for the most part and also two other woman, Megan and Anna. Each narrative is written in the first-person, with Rachel’s part being in the present day, as is Anna’s. Megan’s part is a few months in the past. The use of present tense was a great choice here and gave it a real sense of emergency.The characters were done fantastically and I seem to be in the minority here when I say that I really liked Rachel. Going by reviews I’ve read subsequently, most people felt frustrated with Rachel because of her reliance on alcohol and self-pitying attitude. Mostly, people wanted to give her a good shake. I, however, felt sorry for Rachel and really felt for her. I’ve had experience with a lot of the issues that Rachel raised and so I felt a huge sense of empathy towards her. I thought she was an excellent protagonist and liked her from the start. I actually feel a little angry and disappointed that hardly anyone felt like I did about her. The important thing is though, that love her or hate her, you’ll still likely think this book is great. Saying that, I didn’t particularly like Anna, who narrated a smaller portion of the book and I questioned a turn of her character towards the end. Megan was fine, but felt a little flat at times in consideration of the others. She does however come into her own at one point when she recounts a tragic past happening.Aside from this, the plot was fantastic and peppered with twists and turns. I did, however, feel slightly deflated at the end because I’d guessed the perpetrator. Soon enough I didn’t care though, because I was caught up in the narrative again.Ever since reading this I’ve been thinking about it loads and wishing I could read it for the first time again! Read it as soon as you can and I reckon you’ll love it as much as I did."
2052,Victoria,"I listened to the Audible version, which was well done, and although I didn't like any of the characters except for her landlord who put up with a hell of lot more than I would have, it was still a compelling ""read.""That being said, I figured out about half way through who the killer was and that person turned out to be the biggest ass of all. Oh the tangled webs we weave . . . so 4 stars but only because the lives of these people were like watching a train wreck."
2053,ade,novel thriller itu.. bukan genre gw sebenernya.. tp karena penasaran dari rekomen orang2 dan berita bahwa buku ini akan di film in..alhasil mutusin buat baca.. kebetulan dapat hadiah menang quiz juga haha..dan ternyata...? asli keren bukunya! bikin penasaran dari awal sampe lembar terakhir.. dengan ada 3 pov wanita.. gw beneran harus nebak2 siapa sih yang jahat..dan siapa yang innocent.. dan dugaan gw pada dasarnya salah haha.. keren lah si paula hawkins ini.. padahal ini novel thriller pertamanya..rekomen!
2054,Essi,"What a fantastic book! I'm so glad I read it, because while it gave me a great deal of inspiration to write my own story it also managed to make me hooked 'til the very end! I definitely need to read more books like this. :)"
2055,Fae,"Trust no one and everyone is awful.Did I not just sum up the entire book or what? I know, I know, I rated it four stars and that sounded kind of bitter. It's like this, though: You have an alcoholic who cannot remember things for the life of her and needs to, a cheater that has some odd commitment issues, and a liar (one that doesn't feel bad about it, either). And that's just the women. Then you have an obsessive, controlling husband, a cheating husband (who, mind you, doubles as an ex for one of the other women), and a handsome spoonful-of-sugar therapist. Throw them into a blender, add an old train, a small neighborhood, and some tiny violins. What do you get? A mystery-thriller. One woman goes missing; one of the women lives a few houses down from her with her new, shiny (and stolen) husband and baby on her hip, and the other obsessively watches her practically every morning from the window of the train because she really just has nothing better to do.It's a clusterfuck from the start and as the book keeps going and going and going, you start to learn just how awful all of these characters are. All of them. I think the only two people void from this blanket term is our mystery redhead and the baby and only because she's not old enough to be awful yet; the only thing she's managed to do is get food in poor Mama's hair because she likes nothing but strawberry yogurt for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Even our beloved spoonful-of-sugar therapist is bad deep down.Putting this aside—because it's making me sound bitter—I did enjoy this book, immensely. The writing style was gorgeous and the plot was wonderful; slow at first, like most thrillers, but as it picked up speed, I was engulfed. I could have done with some good people because I like to think that not everyone is awful past the face they put on, but what can you do? A book like this needed characters bad and untrustworthy, which every main character was. Even the bit characters were horrible, though? It was just a world full of cruel, merciless and vindictive people, really. It bothered me slightly, which is where the fifth star went off to. It's hard for me to give this book an entire 5-star rating because of the characters.Nevertheless, I'm done rambling on about it. This book was wonderful. Most are saying it's like Gone Girl, but because I've only watched the movie, I'm not at liberty to say if that's true or not. It's definitely not why I picked this up, though."
2056,Jessica (Kormos),"Wow...when your main character is an unreliable alcoholic, things get more than a little fuzzy.I really enjoyed this novel; I picked it up because of the comparisons to ""Gone Girl"", which I enjoyed. I have to say that I enjoyed ""Gone Girl"" more, simply because it was a very unique cat and mouse game. I will say that for as much as I enjoyed it, ""The Girl on the Train"" left me with a few unsatisfying bits, namely that someone can suffer repeated, concussion-inducing head injuries and somehow just walks out of the hospital with stitches. I had a concussion when I was a kid (hit my head on the bottom of a concrete swimming pool), and let me tell you, you're not just getting sent home with that. I couldn't see straight for days, and you're forced to be kept awake to make sure you don't fall asleep and never wake up again. Rachel has been hit in the head three separate times; the first time so hard that she has lost memory. This is evidence of brain damage, and yet at the end of the novel, she's able to walk out of the hospital with only stitches? No way. They'd be keeping her for observation, and there's no way she would have been questioned before they took her to the hospital. Concussion rant aside, the ending felt too neatly wrapped up after some very long-winded ways of getting there. It jumped the tracks a little (see what I did there?), rambling on for far too long, in my opinion. While Hawkins writes some fabulous character growth, I would have liked to see Rachel grow into a more likable character. Because I wasn't rooting for her at the end, and I think that's maybe the biggest problem. I just felt ambivalent towards the characters by the end. Anna was so wrapped up in her unearned self-righteousness, that even when she did the right thing it was too little too late."
2057,Gaby,"This was a bittersweet reading experience. It was terrifying in a similar (although not as traumatizing) way as “We Need to Talk About Kevin”- something to do with things spiraling out of control, losing yourself, and not being able to trust your own perception of things. The panicky feeling of, “what if I become this, what if this is what my life turns out to be like” is very personal and very hard to shake off. At the same time, this was also a highly entertaining thriller. I’ve seen too many reviews complain that it was easy to tell who the culprit was, which is slightly baffling. I feel the author did a great job building her story, holding your hand, leading you through suspects, and giving you enough clues to suspect person A or B or C or D. Even if you managed to figure it out, so what? It was still a cleverly unfolding mystery with interesting characters. My complaint would rather be about the ending, which stretched my suspension of disbelief. But overall, it was fun. "
2058,Captmashpea,That was a really interesting book. Very creative and its storytelling in the the role that trains play in the story. At first I was annoyed at the switching of narratives but it is really important to the story line and it was well done. Smart story that will stick with you.(Hard Copy).
2059,Linda Hart,"This was a solid thriller that kept me guessing and reading until its surprise ending. The story is told by three very unlikeable women muddling their way through miserable lives all based on egos, lies and alcoholism. They are characters that would be hard for anyone to care about, but they are expertly developed and their individual twisted points of view combined with the bizarre murder makes the story a compelling, suspenseful read. It loses a star for unnecessary bad language, but the audio version is so well done it gained that star back. The voices for Megan and Rachel were awesome. I loved their accents and I think they did a phenomenal job. Anna's voice, however, was annoying. "
2060,Jack Jordan,"The Girl on the Train ☆☆☆☆A very good book to read when on a sunlounger soaking up some rays; I read this in a day and half. I liked that every character has multiple flaws; it's odd how us readers enjoy reading about characters that we dislike. Out of all the characters, I liked Anna the least. She stole a woman's life - taking Rachel's husband and house - and then didn't appreciate Rachel finding it difficult to let go and not hold a grudge. Hawkins has written of Rachel's despair so well. The depression is so real - Rachel can't see it, but the reader can. Even though Rachel is somewhat irrational and out of touch with reality, it's difficult not to feel protective of her, because she's so vulnerable. I found myself frustrated with her weakness for alcohol, wanting her to stop - but that's how alcoholism is. I read the last 150 pages in a morning: my legs in the pool and the sun on my back, the pages getting splashed by swimmers but I didn't care - I would've finished the book right then and there even if there had been hail stones. "
2061,Eric Klee,"The Girl on the Train is about a collection of imperfect people whose lives intersect over the course of a couple of months. The story is set outside London and told from the perspectives of three women: Rachel, Anna, and Megan. Rachel is an alcoholic and ""the girl on the train."" She has no car, so she travels back and forth to work via train. Every day, she passes by the house that she once shared with her ex-husband Tom, who's now married to Anna. Rachel also sees the house a few doors down where Megan lives with her husband Scott. From the train, Rachel imagines they have an idyllic marriage...until one day when Megan goes missing.While the twists aren't as intricate as the mysteries in ""Gone Girl,"" and I was able to guess whodunnit by the time I read 2/3 of the book, this novel held my interest. I enjoyed the plot and the characters, and the story and descriptions were well-written and conversational. None of the characters were (intentionally) truly likeable, though, so it was hard to root for anyone. Rachel is (obviously) the most-developed character, and I felt like I got to know her, even though I didn't like her for the stupid mistakes she kept on making in her life and then repeating them. Megan was probably the second most developed character and the one that I felt most connected to. She had this longing for ""more"" out of life that I think we all feel from time to time, even when we've finally reached a place in our lives where things are comfortable. We should be happy, but we long for excitement. The other characters felt a bit generic, but that didn't detract from the story. All in all, this book is a clear winner and I'm looking forward to the movie!"
2062,Paridhi,"Oh my god! Where do I start? the cliffhangers almost take the life out of me. Such an epic novel. This is my first psychological thriller. No wonder it is called 'THE NEXT GONE GIRL'. And the most surprising experience for me out of this book, I didn't fell in love with the characters. Not even a little bit. All I have done in my entire career as a bookaholic, LOVE THE PEOPLE! And yeah, I didn't like anyone in here. Rachel had her own mistakes, being an alcoholic and all (THOUGH I CAN RELATE WITH THE OBSESSION PART); Megan, well I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT GIRL, ""TWO TIMING"",I mean one side she is with Tom, another time with Kamal? I TOTALLY AGREE WITH RACHEL ON THIS PART""SHE WAS NOT JESS"";not the beautiful, sweet girl who loved her husband. Totally not. ANNA AND TOM SERIOUSLY I HATED HATED HATED THEM!One of he most chilling parts in the novel was when in the end Rachel kills Tom and Anna tries to confirm it by twisting the corkscrew that Rachel jabbed in tom's neck. I WAS SHAKING BY THAT TIME. While reading the book, I had only one question in my mind!IF HE CAN LEAVE THE FIRST FOR THE SECOND, WHY CAN'T HE NOT LEAVE THE SECOND FOR THE THIRD?Well, all in all AN AMAZING READ! "
2063,Patri,"Qué horror de libro, pero en el buen sentido. La primera mitad es horrible y claustrofóbico. A partir de la segunda mitad me da la sensación de que todo se complica demasiado y el final, aunque lo veía venir, reconozco que me ha pillado un poco desprevenida.Lo más curioso es que, cuanto más leía, más me daba cuenta de lo mal que me caían todos los personajes, no se salva ni uno. Y no digo más por no spoilear..."
2064,Gamze,"Trendeki Kız kapağını ilk gördüğümden andan itibaren dikkatimi çekmeyi başaran bir kitap. Hikaye birbirinden çok farklı 3 kadının dilinden anlatılıyor. Rachel, alkolik ve burnunu başkalarının işlerine sokan, sürekli sarhoş ve saplantılı bir kadın. Anna, Rachel'ın eski kocasının yeni eşi, Rachel ve Tom'un boşanmalarına sebep olmuş ve bundan hiçbir zaman rahatsızlık duymamış bir kadın. Megan, iyi bir kocası olmasına rağmen bir türlü mutlu olamayan, geçmişinde yaşadıkları yüzünden psikolojik sorunlar yaşayan ve kocasını aldatan bir kadın. Bu üç karakterin bir hikayeyi anlatması anlamayı zorlaştırır diye düşünürsünüz ama tam da bu anda yazarın başarılı anlatımı ve kitabın sağlam kurgusu devreye giriyor ve ortaya böyle başarılı bir eser çıkıyor. Zaman zaman olayların akışının çok yavaş olması sebebiyle sıkılsam da kitap sayesinde, bazı kadınların ne kadar güçlü, bazılarının ne kadar umursamaz, bazılarının ise yenilginin içine ne kadar yuvarlanmış olduğunu gördüm. Gerilimi nerede derseniz, bu kadınlardan biri sürekli sarhoş o yüzden hiçbir şey hatırlamıyor, diğeri hiçbir şeyin farkında olmadan aslında olayların tam ortasında, üçüncüsü ise kayıp!"
2065,Cehlert,"This book was intriguing and a great way to spend a couple of snow days on the couch. The chapters were paced well at the beginning but I'm not sure if the story might have ""jumped the shark"" at the end or if it just was all about the shark the whole time. "
2066,Channa,"i enjoyed this book, but not as much as gone girl;. i wish they wouldn't make such comparisons bc it makes it hard to read the book for itself and not be thinking constantly about the other book. i think i would've enjoyed it a lot more if i hadn't been thinking abt gone girl the whole time. another book full of jacked up people - love it lol."
2067,Chrysa,"Ανέλπιστα καλό κι ευκολοδιάβαστο. Δεν είχα καμία προσδοκία όταν το ξεκίνησα αλλά ύστερα από μερικές σελίδες δε μπορούσα να το αφήσω από τα χέρια μου, ήθελα οπωσδήποτε να δω τι θα γίνει παρακάτω. Θυμίζει Gillian Flynn αρκετά (κυρίως στο αφηγηματικό στυλ) αλλά το βρήκα λιγότερο φλύαρο. "
2068,Carrie,"Compelling story told in the voices of 3 women, Rachel, Anna, and Megan and one of them is dead. Creepy, sociopathic murder mystery as you begin to deduce what the three women have in common. Rachel is the primary voice, but is an unreliable narrator due to her excessive drinking and blacking out. Her life is a shambles after a nasty divorce and she rides the train daily past her old life and home, which now includes a new wife and child for her husband. She is obsessed with them in a very stalkerish way, fueled by alcohol, but she also develops an unhealthy occupation with another couple in the neighborhood whom she observes from the train. Jason and Jess as Rachel names them are a hip, young couple who appear very much in love. In reality, they are Scott and Megan and they have many secrets and a sense of impending doom. What Rachel witnesses, gets involved with, and can't remember reliably drives the story and makes it hard to put down. Great vacation read. The ending is a little implausible and I found the date sequencing a little confusing/off-putting, but I don't pay enough attention to numbers -- so that's on me. Not as dark as Gone Girl, but not as masterfully written either."
2069,Nags,"it's hard to give a regular review here, you'd like this book if you like reading about flawed people and personalities, imperfect lives, mess-ups, that sort of stuff. I do, so I finished the book in 3 days. the ending was a slight let down but overall, quite a page-turner"
2070,Lorraine,"This was an exciting read which kept me guessing until the end. Rachel is a pitiful woman, 30 years old, divorced and out of work due to drinking too much. She still takes the train into London each morning and home each evening. She watches her old house, where her ex still lives with his new wife and baby, and also the house four doors down, where an attractive young couple she calls Jess and Jason live. One day she sees Jess kissing a different man on her deck, and Jess (actually Megan) is declared missing a short time later, Rachel decides to get involved. She goes to the police to tell them about the other man, and calls Jason (actually Scott) to say she's a friend of Megan's. She quickly gets embroiled into intrigue with Scott and her ex and his new wife."
2071,Scarlet,"
""La vida no es un párrafo y la muerte no es un paréntesis""
La chica del tren es un libro que me impresionó por sus personajes, que es su mayor atributo, están muy bien construídos, las voces de las chicas son muy fuertes y aunque no logras conectar o querer a ninguna terminas conociéndolas y no sólo a ellas sino a quienes las rodean...y dentro de este punto es donde podemos encontrar una falla en el libro, porque al ser tan bien creada la psicología de los personajes, excesivamente pronto sabes que paso y quien lo hizó (el porqué se tarda un poco más, pero poco a poco llegas a eso).
""Una por la pena, dos por la alegría, tres por una chica, cuatro por un chico, cinco por la plata, seis por el oro, siete por un secreto que jamás debe ser contado.""
Entre las muchas críticas que he leído el libro se menciona que la segunda mitad del libro es aburrida, que se va por las ramas, etc. y respecto a eso voy a decir que hay dos formas de ver este libro, una es como una ficción cualquiera, y sí lo ves así puede que tengan razón, pero cuando te das cuenta que es una ficción realista (la situación, los personajes, la investigación, todo eso son cosas que pasan y que puedes encontrar en fuera de esta historia) te das cuenta que está muy bien trabajado, porque toda la trama sigue ese tono, en la vida real las cosas no pasan repentinamente sino que hay una cantidad de momentos que llevan a esa resolución y muchas cosas no son lo que parece hasta que las miras con ojo crítico, y eso es como ellas lo descubren. Sí como lector lo supiste antes es sólo porque tú no lo estas viviendo, sino que eres el expectador. Los giros en la trama no son dramático pero fluyen y funcionan.
""No hay nada más doloroso y corrosivo que la desconfianza""
Es un libro que sin ser perfecto es muy bueno, un concepto bien explotado y que, aunque no te tiene agarrado de las uñas, no aburre en ningun momento. Paula Hawkins hizó un muy trabajo para presentarse al mundo, ahora sólo queda ver sus trabajos posteriores.
""Casi creo que hay un modo de dejar todo esto atrás, pasar la página, volver a casa [...] y vivir mi vida como lo hace la gente normal, sin estarmirando todo el rato por encima del hombre ni esperar con todas mis fuerzas que llegue algo mejor ¿No es eso lo que hace la gente normal?""
"
2072,Erika Suarez,"Es mas bien un 4.5. Me gusto mucho el libro, tiene buen ritmo una trama muy interesante. Al final se hace imposible soltarlo y eso me encantó. No le pongo 5 por qué pude intuir al asesino fácilmente, aún así hay sorpresas al final y eso fue divertido. En conclusión amo los thrillers "
2073,Micki,"I devoured this book in three and a half hours. Many comparisons are made between this and Gone Girl, but for me the only similarity is the unreliable narrator as storyteller. The mystery in this book is slowly unraveled as the narrators share their snippets of what happened from their POV. As many people noted, it is easy to figure out whodunit before the big reveal. I think, however, that this is just a result of good storytelling. A lot of mystery readers enjoy the satisfaction of uncovering the mystery along with the narrator rather than being slapped with a crazy twist ending that comes from left field. There's nothing more frustrating to me than getting to the end and finding that the author left no clues that would have led me to reach that conclusion, so I like that she showed us little hints and clues along the way. Despite being able to figure out whodunit, I felt there were plenty of surprises along the way and the author has a way of ending chapters so that I simply couldn't stop reading! "
2074,Kathleen Dixon,"This came highly recommended by a Goodreads friend and, unusually for me, I ordered a copy from the library straight away. This was despite the fact that I couldn't manage to fit it into any of my current challenges either then or when it finally arrived (quite forgotten by then). However, it can cross an item off another old challenge, which is a good thing as I never quite finish most of them in the months provided and of course the old challenge lists continue to grow. Hmm, idea! Next year my first challenge can be to complete all the old challenges before I think of any brilliant new ones (as I will keep making my own challenges as well as doing the group ones that I enjoy so much).All of which has nothing whatsoever to do with this book! Except to say, that I'm delighted that it managed to jump queue.This book had me guessing all the way. The blurb, the two one-paragraph pages at the start, and then the pile of clothes by the railway line ... The unfolding of the character Rachel in her misery, the looks into the thoughts of Megan and Anna (with their own occasional chapters) ... The confusion, the despair, the gradual reconnection with lost moments ....The one thing I didn't like is the jumps back in time, but this is a purely personal problem. They are perfectly well pointed out, with precise dates every time (and then Morning and Evening segments, which I rather liked). Unfortunately, I'm bad at dates - e.g. I've only got four grandchildren and I can never remember two of their birth dates - and so my mind glosses over dates in books. I'm also bad at reading chapter headings as I'm in such a hurry reading the narrative. However, I understand the author's intent as it means she can write the preceding time segments still in the present tense and that makes the tension even more palpable. And the tension in this novel is excellent! A great read."
2075,Sue,Great suspense novel. Many twists and turns. If you liked Gone a Girl you'll like this.
2076,Mandy,"Wow, what a RIDE. This supremely-crafted, twisting, turning, winding mystery-thriller is a riveting journey that keeps you guessing from start to finish. The three audiobook narrators performed fantastically; normally I'm not a fan of (view spoiler)[unreliable narrators, (hide spoiler)] but this is the most well-crafted usage I have ever experienced. Bravo.P.S.There's no way this won't be made into a movie!"
2077,Chastity,"Started slow, but picked up 1/3 of the way. "
2078,Lorna,"compelling, despite the unlikeable characters. I was a bit disappointed with the end, but worth a read anyway!"
2079,Christine Cook,"An intense psychological mystery. It was very well written although not entirely original, I have read many similar books that aren't as well known. It's definitely a page turner and kept me guessing right up to the end."
2080,Michelle (In Libris Veritas),"The Girl on the Train is not my normal kind of read. I tend to avoid thrillers because of how utterly frustrated they make me. I either guess who the bad guy is way before I’m supposed to or the characters do stupid things and I’m left screaming in my head. Well…The Girl on the Train definitely did the latter, but I found myself desperate to hear every single word of this one.The Girl on the Train takes unreliable narration seriously, giving us one point of view that leaves us constantly guessing while the other two play second fiddle and color our image with bias and extra information. I’m not sure if I was meant to like any of the characters because I hated them all, but I was invested in their stories and the only time I took a break was to sleep or if a customer came in. Rachel is a desperate alcoholic who wants to move on from her ex-husband but keeps spinning her wheels, Anna her ex-husband’s new wife, and Megan the woman who was murdered. All three of these points of view had me in turmoil. I’m pretty sure I was growling at parts of it because they are three of the most frustrating individuals ever, but it’s because of those strong feelings that I enjoyed it so much. This is a ‘whodunnit’ with the emotions amped way up, and I felt just desperate as Rachel at times for the answers to who was responsible for the woman’s death. The entire story takes a lot of time to piece together, and I warred with wanting Rachel to stay out it and wanting her to get involved more.Any time a mystery book manages to keep my highly analytical brain churning and unable to decide just who it was that did the deed for at least the first 60% of the book I consider it a success (though it’s rare)…so for this book to completely through me for a loop until about 75-80% is just amazing. Kudos to you Ms. Hawkins. It might have been I was preoccupied with wanting to punch people for their lack of clear judgment (but who could really blame them), but I appreciate when a mystery actually remains a mystery.The narrators were excellent and I quite liked their ability to put on new personas and give clear voice to other characters. Megan’s voice, Louise Brealey, is my favorite personally because she sounds like Billie Piper and I could honest listen to that woman talk all day. If Louise Brealey may sound familiar and that’s because she’s Molly Hooper on BBC’s Sherlock! The only narrator I had a problem with was Anna, and that’s because she had a flat sort of voice…but honestly it worked well with the type of personality Anna has.I quite like the style of this book and I can’t wait until I get a chance to read more like it, namely Gone Girl. I’ve heard it is an excellent read for those who are aching for a book with a slow forming plot and lots of emotional twisting."
2081,Christylove,"The story pulled me in immediately and I kept turning the pages because I had to know what happened. However, Rachel, the main character, was such a mess and each poor decision made me cringe. Even so, the narration pulled me in and I just couldn't stop reading it. The plot was creative and fast paced. Having said that, I also must say the characters were so flawed as to be nearly unlikable. it reminded me a lot of how I felt reading ""Gone Girl"". "
2082,Delma,"If you liked Gone Girl, you'll like this book too. It's a psychological thriller a la Alfred Hitchcock. Rachel, a sad, depressed alcoholic pines for her ex husband Tom. Tom had an affair that resulted in a pregnancy. He divorced Rachel, married the ""other woman"" and now all three (husband, wife and child) are living happily in the house that was once Rachel's. You heard me, IN THE HOUSE THAT WAS ONCE'S RACHEL'S. Twist the knife why don't you? The train to London takes Rachel past her old neighborhood. From the window of the train Rachel observes her former home but also the daily activities of another couple who are new to the neighborhood. Rachel is fascinated by the new couple. She imagines the fabulous life they live. Then she sees something shocking. It’s only a minute until the train moves on, but it’s enough. Next comes news that the neighbor has gone missing and her husband is a suspect in her disappearance. Rachel offers what she knows to the police, and becomes inextricably entwined in what happens next, as well as in the lives of everyone involved. Has she done more harm than good?"
2083,Nancy Hagaman,"I'm having a hard time deciding about this book. Over-all I guess I liked it. I liked that I was always trying to figure out ""who done it"" and the book kept my interest that I had a hard time putting it down. What seemed to annoy me most was the characters. I know, the book wouldn't be the book without them. BUT, how messed up and dysfunctional ALL the characters were started to annoy me a little bit. Over all a good book though."
2084,Andrea (Cozy Up With A Good Read),"This review and others can be found on Cozy Up With A Good ReadEvery day Rachel takes the same train into town and the same train back, and every day she stares at the houses that she passes and dreams about what is happening inside and what the people are like. Rachel has made a life for these people and then all of a sudden, the woman disappears, Rachel finds herself intrigued and needing to find out what truly happened to ""Jess"".Rachel begins getting deeper and deeper into the lives of this couple and through this investigation of a woman's disappearance, Rachel inevitably begins to confront her own life and the mistakes she has made. As you learn more about Rachel and her life, you wonder what is really happening, and readers are truly taken into a dark circle where you can't tell which way is up.This is really one of those books that not much can truly be said about it, or else the entire story is given away. It is the book that readers really need to experience for themselves and then just pass on to others, it was a book that stayed up reading late into the night because I really wanted to find out not only what happened to Megan, but also what would happen to Rachel and the rest of the characters as the mystery continued to deepen.I honestly was nervous about reading it because of all the hype this book has gotten, but I did really love the mystery Paula Hawkins gave me in this story."
2085,Mike,"Worth the hype. This book oozes dread. I really enjoyed it because creating that sense of doom takes so much talent and it's thrilling to see it play out in this book.I worried and ached for these characters, which made the horrible things so much more horrible. And they're challenging people. I'm still confused about Anna.Overall, perfect summer read. Hell, perfect anytime read if you love dark mysteries."
2086,♛Tash,"Update: 6/10/15The book will be adapted to a film. Emily Blunt might play the lead role. It will also double as a public service movie on the perils of alcoholism and voyeurism.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------There isn't an ounce of kindness in this book, it's all about horrible suburbanites being horrible to each other, which makes it a superb read."
2087,Rbennett1178,This is the first book I've ever completed as an audiobook-I feel that must mean something. 
2088,Ana Garcês,"Sou muito esquisita com os thrillers e policiais que leio porque cresci a ler Agatha Christie. Não é do meu tempo mas o Poirot é uma personagem marcante da minha infância porque devorei todos os livros que o meu pai tinha do detective belga (e eram todos).Quando a TOPSELLER me deu a oportunidade de ler, em primeira mão, um livro que se dizia ser muito bom eu não recusei. Este livro esteve dezoito semanas no primeiro lugar da tabela de vendas do New York Times. Dezoito semanas! Não é brincadeira nenhuma.Li-o em quatro dias. Um bocadinho todas as noites. Aguentei-me para não o ler todo de uma vez e para o fazer durar. Meus amigos e minhas amigas: o Gone Girl ao lado do A Rapariga no Comboio é brincadeira de crianças.Depois de o ler estou aqui para vos convencer a meterem as mãos neste livro IMEDIATAMENTE.Este livro é inquietante e a melhor parte é que ninguém é de confiança, incluindo as três vozes femininas que servem de narradoras desta história.Entre uma alcóolica, uma mentirosa e uma adultera em quem é que podes confiar? Estas são as três mulheres no centro do livro: Rachel, Anna e Megan.Eu adoro de andar de comboio (prefiro até a autocarros) e, como tal, estou sempre a olhar pela janela da carruagem para ver as vistas.Com a Rachel não é bem assim. Ela é a rapariga no comboio que para se esquecer da sua vida miserável imagina como será a vida das outras pessoas. Especialmente a vida da ""Jess e do Jason"" que moram na casa que fica em frente à janela da sua carruagem onde o comboio pára no sinal vermelho todas as manhãs.Mas, certo dia, as coisas não correm como esperado e a Rachel vê algo que destrói a imagem que ela tinha na sua cabeça da ""Jess e do Jason"".E agora ela encontra-se no meio das suas vidas sem certezas do que sabe na verdade mas certa que não pode descansar até descobrir.É interessante que a Rachel - que é, de certa forma a personagem principal - desafie os leitores a pensar em como nós assumimos muita coisa - e fazemos julgamentos - de outras pessoas baseado no nosso conhecimento limitado sobre elas. Sentir pena, nojo, frustração, compaixão e todo um rol de sentimentos por um só personagem é uma coisa rara.Todas as personagens deste livro são terríveis e, como resultado, este livro é uma obra maravilhosa de estudo de carácter e desenvolvimento humano. Também está muito bem escrito e é um thriller psicológico preciso e bem desenvolvido. Eu não estava nada à espera daquele plot twist no final mas caraças, foi maravilhoso!Este livro está cheio de segredos. Toda a gente os tem. É sobre os pequenos mistérios que existem por fora do que vemos à superfície. O que é que acontece atrás de portas fechadas? Até que ponto podemos conhecer uma pessoa? Que horrores existem na nossa memória de Sábado à noite naquele ponto preto do qual não de lembras?A Rapariga no Comboio é fascinante, viciante e oh so very creepy.[Este livro foi-me enviado pela editora em troca de uma review honesta]."
2089,Kayla,"I was addicted. I could not put the book down and I finished it in a weekend, but the crazy ""plot twist"" was not all that crazy. I figured it out pretty early on, and I was disappointed to find out I was correct. Although it's often compared to GONE GIRL, the shock I experienced while reading that book was just not there for THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN. However, the characters were fleshed out and multidimensional. I hated Rachel, Anna, and Megan through most of the story. Actually, there wasn't a single character I found likeable, but they were real and had redeeming qualities. I loved how Hawkins set the scene and used the train as the backdrop for most of the work. It was real and relatable. As someone who rides the train all the time, I know that there are loads of fascinating people that board, but I thought it unique that the author focused on people in the typically blurred landscape. I definitely recommend this novel for someone looking for a thrilling, fast-paced read.I'"
2090,Kayle,"This got SOCLOSE to being a 5 star read for me... but I had guessed the killer less than halfway through the book, and I was disappointed that I was right. I wanted to be thrown for a loop, and that alone knocks it down to a 4.5 for me. Regardless, this was a supremely written book with an interesting point-of-view style. It is full of absolutely ghastly human beings. Normally, I have to like at least one character to enjoy the book because I need someone to cheer for. Everyone was unlikeable. They were a bunch of deeply flawed people who made some unforgivable errors in judgement but the author managed, shockingly, to create moments of empathy for all of them. I'm not a fan of crime novels, but crime novels like this warm me to the idea. The tension building throughout was done exquisitely well, and made the book hard to walk away from. I said ""oh SHIT!"" out loud more than once. The characters were written so authentically that it was easy to forget that the story was fiction, that the narrators were not writing accounts of their own experiences. The writing was meticulous, and the author captured such distinct personalities. I've read some comparisons with Gone Girl, but I feel this was done much better. "
2091,Connie,"Rachel is living a lie, commuting by train every day to a nonexistent job so her flatmate won't know she's been fired. The train often stops in front of the home of "" a perfect, golden couple"" sitting on their rooftop terrace. One morning Rachel notices something shocking when the train makes its stop. The next day the perfect blond woman is reported missing.The main characters are unreliable narrators, women with low self-esteem, cheating spouses, and compulsive liars. Memories are just a little out of reach after heavy drinking. This psychological thriller has lots of twists and turns, and is a quick page turner."
2092,Gadia Duhita,3.5 I expected more from this book. The ending was pretty predictable since the first start; though there were little twists here and there. But its worth to read. 
2093,Word Slinger,"I can definitely see why many people liken this book to Gone Girl - lots of people who aren't very likable. I felt bad for Rachel, though. I really did. "
2094,Sheri,"The characters were all miserably unlikable, but the plot was twisted enough to keep me going. Fun read."
2095,Penny (Literary Hoarders),"Do you want to know how much this kind of hype turns me off for choosing my reading material: ""If you liked Gone Girl"", ""For fans of Gone Girl"", and ""This year's Gone Girl"" is a sure fire bet I will want to avoid said book being compared to another one as intensely as this one is to Gone Girl. But The Girl on the Train was picked for our book club (meeting this evening.) I read Gone Girl, it was okay. In fact, I think this was one in the rare case where the movie was far better than the book. (Pardon me - but Rosamund Pike OWNED that role of Crazy Amy!) It's also a crying shame that The Girl on the Train came out AFTER Gone Girl. Because TGOTT is far better. Yes, there are certainly comparisons to GG with its unreliable characters...but I was thinking more of Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"" while reading. TGOTT is clever, and despite a little bit of a rocky start - it was a little confusing to settle into at the start - I settled in and found I couldn't stop reading. 4.5 stars. "
2096,Jen S.,"I think it's hard to not have really high expectations once a book reaches ""Costco level."" Meaning that by the time The DaVinci Code or any Oprah Book Club book reaches such a wide distribution, you maybe expect more than you should. Case in point: The Girl on the Train is a pretty good book. It's a first-person narrative which I was a bit uncomfortable with when reading from an alcoholic's POV. It had a pretty good ending as well, but the main characters were hard to empathize with, making it a longer-feeling read (if that makes sense). I'll say: not bad."
2097,Yzabel Ginsberg,"(I got an ARC through NetGalley, in exchange for an honest review.)3.5 to 4 stars. Perhaps not the most original thriller ever for someone who's read a lot of such books already, but for me—since I seldom read that genre—it was an interesting story. Guessing who the culprit is turned out to be relatively easy, but this book is of the kind where the whodunnit doesn't really matter: it's how it happened, how and why the person got there, that is the most important part. The fact that the narrators are all more or less unreliable, especially Rachel, also add to the confusion, in a good way.The story is told in first person, from three women's points of view, and each of those give a different insight and different sorts of tidbits, allowing to piece things together gradually. They're all flawed protagonists in their own ways, and this can be seen as either annoying or fascinating, depending on where you stand on the matter. Sometimes, they seemed pretty weak and clingy (as in, being unhappy about their lives but not exactly doing much to change things); on the other hand, I guess we all know that big changes in general aren't so easy to enact as it sounds, and so those protagonists are both relatable and slightly grating, because they might force us to face some problems of our own. (Had I read this book during another period in my life, I might have been uneasy, feeling like I was confronted with things I should be doing, but wasn't.)Whether one ends up liking or disliking the protagonists doesn't really matter, because it's clear they aren't meant to be a hundred percent likeable, and that their roles are never all black or all white. Rachel's alcohol problem and disturbing voyeuristic side (watching people from the train, imagining what their lives may be, then wanting to make her own place in those lives...). Anna who acts all righteous but who still was the proverbial bull in a chine-shop. ""Jess"" whose boredom is understandable, but who also twists truths in her own narrative. ""Jason"" who may not be such the perfect husband. And so on.I would probably not call this book ""the next Gone Girl"", though... but then, I don't like comparing novels in general in such a way. This one stands on its own."
2098,♥ Marlene♥ ,"Feb. 19 2015: This book made me finally get out of my reading slump so I am already appreciative about that.It is quite confusing for me. I wish that in the kindle version they had not just added the names next to the chapters, but also the dates. It would have made it so much more easy for me. After a while I just had to let it go. By it I mean trying to make sense of the story before I should make sense of it. :)Update. Finished this morning and checked on my kindle to see what others thought of the book (amazon) Wow I was surprised of the many many negative reviews and most did not like it because they did not like the characters.I quess I am different because I do not like characters that are perfect and like them with flaws although not those that keep repeating the same mistake.So far I liked 
 and did not like although I did see the reason others did like 
They are all 3 thrillers I've read over the last few months.This book by Paula Hawkins is a perfect book to read when you are in a reading slump because the chapters are mostly build in 2 or 3 part/ Morning, and evening of one day and then divided over 3 women and that is what I love so yes this was a good read for me.Now the big question is. What to read next? Help Me. If you know a good thriller or a book about various women please help me."
2099,Gela,"My friend Lee at work gave this book to me and mentioned that he liked it. He knows I'm addicted to reading. And I love to be introduced to new books.  As for ""The girl on the train"" I liked it , however I was annoyed and pissed off at all the characters 99% of the time. Rachel would piss me off, make me pity her and like her but still feel sorry for her at the same time. She is broken, weak and lost. Now Megan, I couldn't stand her, losing Libby was awful, my heart ached for her. I felt sorry for her but I don't get why she is the way she is. She disgusted me. Anna, narcissistic dumb b*****. Now the men in this book. Ugh don't get me started. As for giving the novel only four stars that's because the ending was predictable and flat. I was looking for the ""wow factor."" This book is believable but I wanted more. But all in all it was good. Read it. I just wish the author gave more about Rachel. For example Rachel quit drinking, got help for her dependency on ""men"" and why she's the way she is problem.  I wanted to see a big change for her not a now I'm curious about Anna unless the author is going to make a series out of this because of the ending. Then again that would be predictable now too. It's a good novel, worthy of a mystery on ""The Lifetime"" network. You know the one(issue), every woman has a bad man,issue's with a crazy woman or a bad momma. I can't see a movie coming out of this.  Okay, I need to stop because this is sounding more like a bad review and it's not how I feel. I like how the author made the ""drunk,"" assumed crazy lady the good gal or right gal. However, Tom wasn't seen for what he really was which left me hanging. I kind of wanted to something else from Anna and Scott. Okay, still sounds like a bad review lol. Good points. The woman and their messed up personalities revolving around MEN. (There are problem ladies MEN. Lol just joking) However the book does make you think about why we as women put up with so much, change ourselves,and let a bad relationship change us or why we put so much validation on ourselves because of men. Anna's no man would choose that over me, sorry chica but a hard **** has no conscience. And yet her arrogant, narcissistic ways clouded what was really what. Tim was a man who wanted his cake, pie, pudding and eat it too.  I like the book because I like seeing the crazy a** b****** in my mind and thinking, "" thank God I'm not that stupid, naive or have fallen so low."" You first see it as a tragic love story and a wounded heart, is she nuts? Then omg she was just abused to the point if a breakdown. Lesson learned, love may be blind but damn why the stupidity. All the females in this novel were weak. The characters are very believable. "
2100,Leila,"People compare this book to Gone Girl (not a favorite of mine), but something grabbed me in this one in a way that Gone Girl did not. I actually read the whole book in a day. And I liked it. Ish. Meaning I noticed some of the flaws -- kind of flat, unlikeable characters; multiple narrators with indistinguishable voices; women characters who seem weak and/or completely define themselves by the men in their lives -- but still, I read and engaged and enjoyed the story. It won't be winning any fine fiction awards, but for a quick summer read, The Girl on the Train delivers. Solid 3.5 stars."
2101,Maud,"vanmorgen begonnen in bed aan dit boek, ben benieuwd na al de positieve commentaren dat ik eerder van dit boek las...ik lees dit wel als ebook dus vooruitgang met bladzijden zal er niet komen...wachten tot het einde voor de beoordeling :-)"
2102,Julianne Dunn,"I'm still uncertain how I feel about this book. Told through the POV of three women involved in vastly different ways to a disappearance, the overall tone is just depressing. Primarily, we read through the lens of Rachel, a woman who has devolved into a drunk, who thinks she saw something important in relation to the disappearance. She comes off so broken that it is difficult to continuing reading. She is obsessed with her ex husband and we frequently start her sections off with her trying to piece together what terrible thing she did the night before while drunk. We also have Anna, Rachel's ex husband's new wife, and Megan, the disappeared woman (although her story is told from an earlier time period). There are so many cringe-worthy moments as Rachel becomes more and more obsessed with Megan's disappearance. But this isn't a straight forward mystery. While there is a thriller component, what has stuck with me is the inner lives of these women and how much we all carry inside. Hawkins does a great job of contrasting how this internal pain might stay contained or might leak over into lives. "
2103,Vera Neves,"4,5 estrelas"
2104,Valia Lind,"Yes! I love being right!! And this book was so good. I flew through it. It was definitely different from what I expected, in the way it was told and written, but I thought it was great for the story. An awesome debut! "
2105,Diana Leigh,"There's lot of buzz going around about THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN, and for the most part, I think it lived up to the hype. It's a dark psychological thriller that was easy to get wrapped up in. Rachel, a.k.a the girl on the train, likes to snoop on people's lives outside the window as she rides back and forth to London, which gets her in a web of trouble when she sees something disturbing. Rachel is unstable, and her life is a mess, so can her story be believed? The doubts I had about Rachel made this an entertaining story to read. I love unreliable narrators -- fun and frustrating.If I compare this book to that other ""girl"" thriller (GONE GIRL), it falls a bit short. THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN had plenty of interesting twists and big reveals along the way, though I wasn't that surprised by the ending. I also thought that the women in this book were just too weak in character, as in a wee bit pathetic? Overall, I did enjoy the book though!! Kept me reading late into the night... Impressive debut, and I'll definitely pick up Paula Hawkins next novel. 4 stars!"
2106,OhWell,"Most people compare The Girl on the Train to Gone Girl, but apart from the word “Girl” in the title and the fact that both novels are mysteries told, partially, from the point of view of unreliable narrators, they don’t have all that much in common. Gone Girl is indeed a thriller and the twist of the story is totally unexpected. The Girl on the Train, on the other hand, is closer to a traditional mystery. Despite the fact that Gone Girl packed more of a punch and was more unexpected, I found that I enjoyed The Girl on the Train more. It could be the fact that, in the end, I could empathize with at least some of the characters."
2107,Janet,"A female unreliable narrator. No, it's not Gone Girl. Rachel takes the commuter train into London and back everyday, and makes up stories about the people who live in the houses she passes. When she witnesses something at one of these houses, she begins to leave the train and interfere in the neighborhood and with the people who live there. I won't give away any more than that. I liked the book, liked being along for the ride with Rachel, and recommend it. "
2108,Flavia,"This is a really juicy novel about deliriously bad people. Fun, creepy, enjoyable and although you do see the ending coming I was still biting my fingernails, the tension is wrought and drove me to finishing this novel in two sittings. Wonderful!"
2109,Janette Liddle,Read this book in as few of sittings as possible and pay attention to the details. She does a really great job of teasing the story along through a choppy chronology and three points of view. I loved riding this train!
2110,Amy Neff,Good read with a few twists
2111,Shanequea,"3.5 stars..I had to add the .5 because this was definitely an enjoyable read! I actually really liked the way the story was written. I also wasn't too hung up on the way that the characters were written. Just because I didn't like any of them, doesn't mean that I couldn't enjoy the read. I guessed the ending pretty early in, but I was still interested enough to finish the book in one sitting. I'm guessing the writing kept me reading...or maybe it was the curiosity of wanting to know exactly how this mess ended.With that being said...I couldn't give a higher rating because I hated ALL of the characters. They were all horrible people. The women were sad excuses for human beings. I couldn't identity with any of them. The men were just frightening, to be frank. I don't think that I've read any novel in which I was unable to find one redeeming quality in a single character. The writing and story had to exceptional because if not, I could/would not have finished this story."
2112,Rozina Fabian,"The story of the book is described by three different characters in three different ways. As you turn each page with more and more curiosity, you never know what it's going to happen till the end of the book. The fact that the story is described at the first person singular, it makes it more personal. The overall style of writing is very catchy and keeps your interest until the end. "

2114,Tabitha,"Where Gone Girl missed, The Girl on the Train gained. A much better thriller, with a much better ending."
2115,Jennifer (livresaddicted),"This book was very good ! I wanted to know what happened so badly ! I read a lot of thriller in my life and this one is different from all the others, because of the way the story is narrated. "
2116,Meganm922,"The Girl on the Train has a lot of hype and is frequently lumped with Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn, as if all of us readers are constantly searching for the next similar book.. a suspense that isn’t quite a crime drama and run of the mill mystery… for good reason. The Girl on the Train deserves every bit of that hype and is lumped accordingly with Gone Girl because it’s similar, it gives readers the twist and fucked-up-ness that we are so desperately searching for after experiencing Gillian Flynn’s books. I loved The Girl on the Train. It was twisted, confusing, and messed up. I expected an outsider to notice the couple on the deck from the train, but I never expected her life to intertwine with theirs the way that it did. I never expected Rachel to have such problems, either.  I enjoyed every bit of the new and unexpected details that came flooding in when I began the book. My favorite part about the novel is kind of why some people dislike it (and Gillian Flynn’s books as well). There are no likeable characters. As much as you want to sympathize with Rachel, you can’t. You dislike everyone, including the couple on their deck. Everyone is terrible, selfish, and full of twists, secrets, and issues. But I love that because it’s so rare in fiction and it’s so common in real life. Why should there be a hero? Why can’t characters have issues that make them unlikable? Why should that impact my ability to enjoy the story? I’ll never understand readers who always want likeable people and likeable events in their books. I think it’s interesting to get a glimpse of people and their situations and not be moved to sympathize with them. The Girl on the Train has a synopsis that works and is spot on, but just goes to show you that not everything is what it seems. It was great and I’m glad I read it. It deserves the hype, but I think a lot of readers will dislike it because it features such unlikable characters and it is much more predictable. After all, we were looking for a Gone Girl twist and I think it’s easier to find one when you are looking for it. I highly recommend the book, but if you’re reading it just because it’s what people are talking about, I suggest waiting until the mood truly strikes you so that it isn’t a chore and so that it doesn’t fall short of your expectations.Love Literature Art and Reason Review"
2117,Cynthia Vander Woude,"Not great literature, but certainly a good read. The last 100 pages were great."
2118,Alexa,"You know, I really liked this! The women are all kind of terrible, but in different and relatable ways. I liked that the author didn't make them suddenly become better than they were laid out to be, you know? Especially Rachel I often wanted to shake, but I think it's a good sign when you feel frustrated by a character's limitations - you're involved in the story, right? I didn't find the end as uneven as some people did - maybe because I was anticipating the twist, because of the inevitable Gone Girl comparison. And I guess that the comparison is indeed fair enough, even beyond the bookclub phenomenon thing. However, I thought that this one felt more grounded. Maybe less crazy exciting, but more believable, too. I mean, I wouldn't go to the mat defending every choice the author made, but I found this to be a very engrossing, frothy thriller. Would recommend!"
2119,Kenny Bellew,"This book is wildly popular right now. It won this year's Goodread award for Mystery & Thriller, and I understand a movie is due out later this year based on the book. It's about a woman down on her luck who rides a train to London to pretend she has a job. Every day, she sees the same couple in their home from her seat on the train, and she invents a perfect life for this couple, until the day, from the train, she sees the perfect woman kiss a stranger. The perfect woman then ends up missing--presumed murdered. Before I say what I didn't like, I'll tell you that the ending is very satisfying and made what I didn't like worth wading through. However, for me, there was a little too much relationship-back-and-forth to story telling ratio. It's like horror books that have too much gore to story ratio at times; this book had too much worrying about who still loves whom or hates the other (for my tastes). Still, it's a must read. Medium-sized book at 325 pages. Read it before the movie is my recommendation. "
2120,Jean Marie,"I actually like it better than Gone Girl. It's not as cleanly written nor was twisty but the suspense is there. Worth a read, nice and easy but don't expect to be throttled. But it's fascinating enough and well constructed to keep you reading and wanting to know what happened. It gets brownie points for being distinctly British as well. And I enjoyed how it dealt with the reality of contemporary life. Addition, depression, vanity, egotism and so forth. The portraits were viciously honest. No one is perfect and everyone hides something. "
2121,Steph Hundt," Oh boy, I am not normally a reader of thrillers but I sure am glad I listened to the Bestseller's List and picked this one up. This book grabs you and doesn't let you go until the fianl page. I was totally caught up in the lives of these characters. Rachel is an out of work alcoholic prone to blackouts. This causes a problem when she feels she may have witnssed something that could shed light on a murder, but can not remember it. She is still hung up on her ex-husband who cheated on her. She rides the train every day into London to her fictional job that she lost months ago to fool her roomate into believing she's still working. She sees the same couple on the route the train takes every day and begins to create a story in her head about their perfect life and love, so diffeernt from her own. Then she sees something unexpected on her morning commute and it pulls her into the mystery."
2122,Amy,So good...Gone Girl crossed w/Liane Morniarty. Couldn't put it down!
2123,Caitlin,"I would 100% recommend this book to all of my pals. It was an interesting, albeit predictable, thriller. The premise is super intriguing. The whole book takes place in segments of morning and evening to coincide with the passing of the train. This book is not a work of literary genius, and it does feel like certain phrases are repeated again and again; however, it is a very good piece of filler fiction. I was entertained the entire time and could not wait until my next chance to read! This is an Anna, Amy, Stonefire Office Bookclub book for sure!"
2124,Lydia,"I read this novel shortly after reading Gone Girl. The premise of the story was fascinating. On her morning commute, a woman begins to focus on the residents of a townhouse. Over the course of time she creates a life for them in her head- and one day she determines that something has gone awry. This leads to a whole series of decisions on her part that make up a wild ride.I did think it went a bit over the top. While I enjoyed the story, it was all just a bit too dark."
2125,Heidi Potenza,"WOW! What a crazy, twisty turn of a story! When I began reading, I found it sad and confusing. The three points of view were somewhat odd and disjointed to follow along with. As the story progressed, I suddenly found myself drawn in to the plot and wondering what would happen next. I couldn't really feel for Rachel until the end - she was so damn self-destructive. Once you figure everything out though, it really makes you wonder about people and their personal demons. I did enjoy the way all three character stories were intertwined together, but I have to admit that there were a few moments when I wondered if it was all one person writing from multiple personalities. I HATED Gone Girl so this comparison wasn't even close! "
2126,Kia Taylor,"I need 4.5 stars!It is definitely tough to talk about this one without giving spoilers. The characters are all pretty unlikeable in general, but I think the author nicely pulls off the trick of developing them more as the story goes along so your opinion of them changes. I came to rather like Rachel towards the end.This book does start off pretty slowly. And I was less than impressed with the ""shocking"" thing Rachel saw on the train. I was expecting more of that moment - even though it develops into more. Once this book picked up steam, I was hooked and cursing the fact that my drive time ended and I had to pause. I didn't guess the mystery ahead of time so that was good too. I hate it when I see where things are going before you get there!As far as the audiobook, the voice actress who read for Rachel was great. Her male voices were really good too - some readers (both male and female) really falter here and it can make for a horribly distracting listen. The other two narrators were alright - or maybe it was that their characters were annoying so I found their voices irritating as well?"
2127,Devan,Great page turner. Intricately woven stories of two women whose paths creepily cross. Definitely threw some twists in there.
2128,Jess ,I really enjoyed this book!
2129,Suze,"I was in the middle of another book, but a review from a friend made me want to look at it to see if I wanted to add it to my ""to read"" list. Well, that didn't happen. I read the first few pages and was hooked, the other book forgotten.This book, a psychological thriller, grabs you from the first few pages and doesn't let go till the exciting end. The characters are wildly erratic, making who did what a total guessing game. Some are comparing this book To 'Gone Girl' - I disagree with them. This storyline has a more viable ending, which is much more satisfying. 'Gone Girl' ended suddenly, leaving the readers disappointed. This book does not do that, and is thrilling to the very end.I look forward to the next book from this author. Highly recommended!"
2130,K.D. Winchester,"As you can imagine, it's hard to give a proper review of a book with major plot twists. BUT I will say, that this book explores the psyches of three women. Being inside three women's heads can get a bit tedious, but most of the time you just can't believe what's happening.The story keeps unraveling and unraveling, taking advantage of every detail given or not given. It's a crazy ride; I listened to the entire book in about a day.That's all very vague, but if I give you ANY spoilers, it will ruin the book. So just take my word for it. If you like thrillers, this book is pretty awesome."
2131,Bernou,"First of all, I want to say, as far as crime thrillers go, it ticked all the boxes. I was completely in the dark as to the identity of the killer until very late in the book, and for a while it seemed like it could be literally anyone - including the narrator herself. I did have some minor issues with it - firstly, everyone in this book is pretty much an awful person. The alcoholic, stalker-y narrator is the most likeable character. Also Cathy. She was kind of written as annoying and meddling but I feel like she was the only normal person in the whole story. Also, the way Scott wasn't at all punished for his emotional and physical abuse - with Rachel even apologizing to him at the end, though for what I'm not entirely sure - doesn't sit well with me. With that being said, I still enjoyed the book and read it in one sitting."
2132,Richard Thurman,"The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins is a good psychological thriller/mystery that keeps you guessing. The story unfolds through the eyes of three first-person narrators: all female, all unreliable. The main character, the girl on the train, is Rachel: a sad, desperate, alcoholic, whose life is spinning out of control. She watches the lives of strangers from the window of her commuter train and imagines that they are living the wonderful lives that she cannot. A quote from Rachel: “Hollowness: that I understand. I'm starting to believe that there isn't anything you can do to fix it. That's what I've taken from the therapy sessions: the holes in your life are permanent. You have to grow around them, like tree roots around concrete; you mold yourself through the gaps”.Meanwhile, through the narration of the other two women we learn that their lives are very different from the ones imagined by Rachel. One of the narrators goes missing and we begin the mystery of whether foul play was involved, and if so, who is the culprit. This book is, inevitably, compared to Gone Girl, and the comparison is valid. I liked The Girl on The Train quite a bit better. I felt that The Girl on the Train delivered on its early promise, and I felt engaged in the story right up to the end. I give the book 4 stars. My only real complaint is that I didn’t like a single character in the book. At times I felt sympathetic toward each of them, at other times frustrated and annoyed. Still, I recommend this book."
2133,Praiz Sophyronja ,"Yay, finally! My aunt finished it and is lending it to me. ***"
2134,Bobbi ,I was gripped. I love Hitchcock and this was Hitchcockian in its slow unfolding. And the first person narration worked really well. I give it 4 stars only because I'm trying to reserve 5 stars for Anna Karenina and the like. 
2135,Anastasia,"For the first third of this book, I was on the edge of my seat. The story flips back and forth between the perspective of the three main woman characters: Rachel, Anna, & Megan and through their stories you are able to add another puzzle piece to the whole big mystery. This aspect keeps you on the edge of your seat for a long time until enough of the pieces are available and the big picture is revealed to you - which is great! Except that the mystery was not very original to me. So that's why I'm giving it 4 stars: great job at keeping me on the edge of my seat, a lot of suspense in how the ending would wrap up; however, those last few puzzle pieces were an expected outcome."
2136,Cassidy,"4 starsWell then, that was an interesting ride. Rachel is just a girl on the train, who's created a fantasy world around the couple living fours doors down from her old house. Jess and Jason are the perfect couple, just what she and her ex used to be. But one day, Rachel sees something happen between Jess and someone she doesn't know. When Jess goes missing, Rachel feels she has to offer up her information, and ends up getting deeply involved in the following investigation. I'm pretty sure this can be compared with ""Gone Girl"", but since I gave up on that one after about 70 pages, I'm not entirely sure. I do have to say that when I compare what I managed to read with this, I found this a much better story (not a big fan of drama for drama's sake). With that said, there is quite a bit of that in this story, narrated in first-person, by three different women. Rachel is an alcoholic who can't get over her ex-husband Tom. She consistently complains about making terrible decisions while drunk, but can't seem to stop drinking. I found myself wanting to throttle her sometimes! Anna is Tom's ex-wife, happy to flaunt that he chose her, but terrified at the sight of Rachel. Anna can't do enough to get rid of her- a pot-stirrer, that one. And then there's Megan. Sweet, little Megan who wasn't quite as wholesome as Rachel believed her to be. I figured out a major part of the plot about 1/3 of the way through, but the author did have me questioning myself later, so it's wasn't too bad. I wasn't a huge fan of the coarse language or the many mentions of sex, but it's a secular novel, so it's to be expected. Overall, a pretty interesting read."
2137,Renita D'Silva,Thrilling and unputdownable. 
2138,Deb,"This was strange in the beginning, but once it got going I could not put it down! Very good!"
2139,JuliannaM,"Whew... Well, I finally found that I had time to finish Paula Hawkins' thriller The Girl on the Train, although it wasn't for lack of interest. This is an absolute page turner and a tightly written thriller. The novel also has a wonderfully complex, emotional cast of characters that brings the story to life in a painfully human way. My only criticisms would be that Hawkins' characters were not fully developed, in the sense that their potential to be powerful, resilient women was not realized as fully as I thought it could have been. The protagonists' reactions to their situations were realistic, but I want bad ass folks in my fiction reading! I also found the ending to be somewhat predictable... I guessed the killer about two thirds of the way through, although there was a minor twist at the very end that surprised me. Overall, a very good, diverting read; I've actually already loaned it to a friend!"
2140,Dee,"More 3.5 stars - I didn't like the main character, but was compelled to keep reading. Not really sure how I feel about the ending... Worth a read, though."
2141,Celena Urquia,"One hell of an adrenaline rush, although it's fairly easy to solve the mystery about halfway through."
2142,Cara,"One of those books where every single character is contemptible, and not just because they all use the word ""quieten""* way too much.* And apparently this is a real word. It sounds made up to me, but evidently it's just a Britishism. One I sincerely hope never catches on around here."
2143,Jenny,"I listened to this audiobook while I was literally a girl on a train traveling through Europe. I started it on a train ride from London to Edinburgh, and since the book is set in England I recognized some of the city names which made it feel even more appropriate a choice for my train ride. ;o)This is yet another book that's been compared to Gone Girl and of all the books in that category, this felt the closest to fitting that description. It's filled with unlikable characters who still nevertheless draw you into the story and there's a twist.The book starts off a bit slow and it took me a while to get interested in Rachel's story. She came off to me as weak and depressed and also made questionable actions where I kind of wanted to smack her upside the head. But I also felt sorry for her and did sympathize with her after a while. Megan wasn't drawn much more likable but she was a lot easier to sympathize with because of all the things she had gone through in her life. The third narrator, Anna, doesn't get her POV introduced until much later in the book and she was my least favorite because she was so self-centered and I also didn't like her voice much in the audiobook. The other two women I thought did a better job and had voices that better matched their characters.The narrators are a bit unreliable which I don't necessarily mind since I think it can add to the story, but in this case it also made the twist seemingly come out of left field (although it still made sense).Overall it was an interesting book and pretty well-done with the different narrators but not one that left me with a desire to rave about it to friends after I finished it."
2144,Diana,"I was annoyed a the blurb about this book someone quoting Hitchcock!! Um I don't think so. It took me a while to really get into this book, because the tooing and froing on the monotonous train journey. Although; of course this was setting the scene for the drama that was unfolding VERY SLOWLY!!. I'm sure we have all looked at the houses and gardens we pass on the train and wondered about who lives there. This particular train stopped at the Halt signal; the house & garden visibly seen from the train.Although when the story got going it definitely got my attention and romped away...I was gripped.. a real page turner.The story is told from 3 perspectives 3 quite different women with their own secrets and past fears & longings. Rachel, Tom's ex wife, Anna, Tom's present wife & Megan the neighbours wife. Intertwining stories ""Lies and Secrets.""Believable character analysis, however Rachel and Anna have never met Tom's family or friends I think this was rather an unbelievable naivety on the part of these two women. Would that happen in real life? I would be interested to read more fiction from this Author."
2145,Diane,"The reason why I'm rating this as a 4 is because it didn't quite live up to my expectations. Given that it has mostly been marketed as the next Gone Girl, there was too much hype that it was almost impossible that the book could live up to it.I really hate this about myself but halfway through the book, I already made up my mind about whodunnit and I was right. I think watching too much whodunnit shows took its toll on me. But prior to figuring it out, I really liked that there was a point that everyone was a suspect. I couldn't trust anyone! I honestly kept hoping that I was wrong just to enjoy the 'twist' more.But this doesn't mean I didn't enjoy reading the novel because I did. It was compelling despite knowing what's going to happen next. I highly enjoyed this quick read about the dark parts of the human psyche and was left wanting more.If you liked Gone Girl, then odds are you'll enjoy this one too. Not quite as much, but close enough."
2146,Liselott,"It surely was a page turner, or to be precise; a blindfolder (if that term exist), because when I was listening to this captivating and so well descriptive story when walking to the supermarket, I got so engrossed , that I actually neverarrived at the store. It was only when I saw some teens vandalising a bus shelter and they interrupted my fictional world that I realised I was lost. I literally didnt have a clue where I was at first. Kind of similar to Rachel in the book."
2147,david bignell,"Well written,really liked the author used the three female narrators to fill in the story. I also liked how it jumped back in forth in time. This type is not my usual read, but the comparison to Gone Girl and Rear Window sold me on it. The best way to sum this up is to trust no one, the characters are all deeply flawed people with serious problems which makes for a great summer read. "
2148,Maegen Pane,Enjoyed Hard to put down. Loved and empathized with all the female main characters and liked how their connection unfolded at end. 
2149,Keetha,"A solid 3.5 stars. I had heard this book was amazing and about the big twist, so I was expecting one, a la Gone Girl. But the twist wasn't so much a twist, not exactly. The Girl on the Train is a thriller and I enjoyed it. Nicely done, and I'll definitely pick up the next novel by Paula Hawkins. "
2150,Tez,"I decided that 2015 would be the year that I read what I want when I want, and not just read particular books because I feel like I ""should"". It's early in the year, and I've already strayed from my intention with various results. (Sorry, but I wasn't interested enough to finish Emily St. John Mandel's Station Eleven.) But I'm so glad I decided to try Paula Hawkins's The Girl on the Train.The comparisons to Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl are inevitable: ""Girl"" in the title, unreliable narrator, crime from the POV of someone who's NOT a professional investigator, ""unlikeable"" female lead character... But I warmed to The Girl on the Train much more. Often times I struggled with Rachel Watson due to her alcoholism, but she really does try to do the right thing, though often for the wrong reasons.Paula Hawkins has crafted an intoxicating story with flawed-yet-familiar characters and page-turning twists. The Girl on the Train is an international best-seller for a reason: it's bloody good, and should appeal to fans of Brit crime. An intriguing read that's left me impatient for news about the author's next novel."
2151,Jessi,"What can I say that hasn't already been said about this book? It's pretty freaking awesome and definitely worth a read.Told from the point of view of three different women, the narrative jumps around not only from person to person but in chronology as well. As their stories continue, we realize that something horrible lead up to a death and that none of the narrators could be describe as reliable..."
2152,Donna Pallini,"I struggled with the rating but decided on 4 stars because I thought Ms Hawkins did a good job in expressing feelings, sights, and sounds. I did think she went overboard with Rachel's pathetic character. I couldn't relate to her but was rooting for her in the end. The story did keep my interest and overall I enjoyed this novel. "
2153,Erika,"As far as thrillers go, it really was quite a ride to read this book, I couldn't put it down. I like how it's written and the women in this book are all complex and problematic whilst keeping everything mysteriously relatable."
2154,Tandi Cain,"I really enjoyed this book. It was a page turner. Each character was developed and explored. Secrets poured out on each of them until the very end of the book. It was definitely a good whodunit. I was a little disappointed that I knew who did it earlier than I wanted to. I realized though that it was revealed in perfect time, because there was more to be shared and shown once we knew. I particularly enjoyed that the character development included other people's perception of the character. The author did a great job of layering the character development with objective study of the character. I enjoyed the way the book was written in each woman's voice. I thought the voyeuristic quality of the storytelling to be brilliant. People-watching is a timeless favorite. We love to imagine the lives and nuances of people we see, but do not really know. This book has been compared to Gone Girl and I do not agree. They both are similar in their twists and turns and reveals. But, ""Girl on a Train"" has a storytelling style all its own. "
2155,Jenna,"This novel was a pleasant surprise and you need to read it right now! Don't read any reviews, just read it. Told in the voice of 3 female narrators - none are to be trusted. How easy it is to get caught up in the lives of people you only see as you sit on a passing train, that is exactly what happened to Rachel and it got her into some hot water and making her very unreliable. A story filled with secrets and full of grittiness. Amazing character development and very well written, it wasn't hard to figure lout who the culprit was early on, but that didn't deter me from wanting to know what happened along the way while still holding my interest the entire time.I devoured this novel - and that doesn't happen very often. I loved the thrill, I loved the mystery. Would I compare it to Gone Girl? I don't think you really can. There is no book that stands up against Gone Girl. I LOVED Gone Girl and I really really liked The Girl on the Train. Paula Hawkins has instantly become an author I will be keeping my eye on."
2156,Kate.,"What you see on the outside is rarely what it is on the inside. Told from three different women's perspectives ,we learn about a crime that everyone had motive to commitAlthough I guessed the baddie halfway through I still enjoyed seeing all the pieces come together , going though it with Rachel as she fought through the fog. Everyone in this book is messed up but they ring true to real life more than the other ""Girl"" book. My favourite character was Rachel , I could feel her pain and betrayal and how wretched she felt having her life turned upside by another persons selfish behaviour (including her own) Her drinking made me mad at times but I understood the why of it. I recommend this to anyone looking for a fast paced escape with twist & turns. "

"
2158,CJ,Quick and very dirtyAn honest to goodness mystery told quickly and well. Very enjoyable for this old mystery aficionado. I'll be looking forward to a next one.
2159,Will Siu,"In general, this was a very good book and would recommend it for a quick read.I'm just not sure how much I enjoyed the ending because it happened so quickly and I wish there was more development."
2160,Toffeechu,"Like a British Gone Girl, the women in this story are real and flawed, the men are untrustworthy and the memory loss trope is made acceptable as this slow burning mystery unravels around the protag, who is a struggling alcoholic. Take away lessons: adultery is bad...and hell has no fury like a woman scorned. "
2161,Cora Tower,"This was a great book to read in short spurts. Based on friends reviews I wasn't sure how I would feel but it kept me guessing and wasn't too predictable even when I figured out who the killer was. The one thing that almost turned me off though was Rachel's drinking problem, sometimes it disgusted me and other times I felt so sorry for her I think the way in which I read it was what kept it interesting though, if I was able to focus and read in long sessions I think it might have eliminated some of the intrigue."
2162,Nati,"muy buen libro para evadirse un rato, súper entretenido. El final no se ve venir"
2163,Scott McKenzie,Five word review: Amnesia thriller. Everyone has problems.
2164,Reagan Elaina,"Guys I finished this book two days ago and then just couldn't review it... fffffff wow. So nice to pick something up that isn't like anything else I've read. Loved the characters, loved all the points of view, the timing, everything, YES! Lovely Lovely Lovely! I want to travel to London now :( Started watching people more after this, such an interesting read."
2165,Kanika Jain,Finished this book in two days flat! Have come across a gripping thriller after quite some time. A page-turner for sure. But the book's narration was quite similar to Gone Girl (and of course the name). I wouldn't want to read this kind of genre again as it just leaves you rattled as you become obsessed with the twisted characters. A top-notch thriller but unsettling for some!
2166,Hafshie,"
 ""I have never understood how people can blithely disregard the damage they do by following their hearts. Who was it said that following your heart is a good thing? It is pure egotism, a selfishness to conquer all.""
This is really a hard to tell story. I'm a bit afraid to have my words about it because I might be judgmental. It's not a story that I would want to blab about too. It's just, it has so many terrible and horrible stuffs that I wouldn't want to remember. I leave you the freedom to choose whether to read it or not. Well, I don't really have much of a choice, do I?How the story affected me?First, it ruined my plan of going on a romantic train ride. Uggh! Now, I'll be remembering this story whenever I'm on a train! Maybe I'll be even imagining things like that blue dress Rachel saw on the train. Maybe I'll even try to make up stories on people who live near the railways. Or worst, I won't even look out the train window. And who's fault it is? Damn me! I shouldn't have read it in the first place if I'm going to act this way. I'm solely to blame! But you can't really blame me. It's a mind-trapping piece! You'll be glued to the mystery part of it immediately! Really. Yes, just because I was. Kidding! :DDSecond, it totally ruined my wishful thinking of a HEA married life. It gave me the creeps! Nowadays, stories of unfaithful relationships are trendy! But this one so far is like the worst kind of it. You know. What if I fell inlove with a natural liar like him? or worse, I become one like her? No, I can't be! I'll end up having the 'Unfaithful' song by Rihanna as my themesong (yeah, this is my greatest problem). And I'm now literally thinking of 'BAD BLOOD' by Taylor Swift as the story's OST. How's that? 
Did you have to do this? I was thinking that you could be trustedDid you have to ruin what was shiny? Now it's all rustedDid you have to hit me, where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't breatheAnd rub it in so deep, salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me
Well, the lives of the characters in this story suck which makes the story terrible and horrible but on the contrary, the whole point of the story is good. It opens us to the idea of being careful with our decisions in life, to whom we entrust ourselves, and to really get to know the people that surrounds us. Because, we don't know or it might be too late for us to know that the person whom we love the most, or whom we thought loves us the most is actually the one who'll put us to danger. So don't just believe anyone. Another thing I like about the story is the way it depicted how Alcoholism leads to terrible, terrible things. So let's not engage to the habit of drinking to the fullest and heaviest. Okay? Yes.Rating: 4 terrible stars!Yes, the story it told was terrible but it's still mind-trapping, mind-blowing, mind-boggling and mind-nevermind. In short, it's a terrible but good-story. "
2167,Ally,"I saw a review that stated this novel was full of nothing but terrible people (but went on to say that it was great literature). I would disagree on the first point. I would say it's full of morally complex people. That's what makes this book so gripping and continually interesting. There is a lot of grey here, and I love the grey. The main character is one of the most complicated, sad, frustrating, fascinating and infuriating women I've ever had the pleasure to read. Also, this novel employed shifting time and narrative, which are favorite devices of mine. There are a lot of comparisons to Gone Girl, and it's a very fair comparison, but this is also definitely its own tale. "
2168,Kristen ,"So many people recommended this book, even though it didn't sound like my jam I had to give it a go. I think my expectations were like medium, not crazy high like with Gone Girl where the whole world was all about it, but just several people I know. If that makes sense. Either way, it took me a bit to get into, the switching POVs confused me. I didn't see 'it' coming and overall, I enjoyed it and highly recommend it. It's probably more like 4.5 stars, but still. Recommend, yes you should read."
2169,Joannah Rose,"If Gone Girl is a crazy rollercoaster ride, The Girl on the Train is like being on a plain train. It took me three months to finish this, partly because I've been busy and partly because I didnt find it as well-crafted as Gillian Flynn's. I don't really mean to compare, but since everyone's been digging it as thrilling as Gone Girl, I would say that the storyline and the way the plot was presented became somehow predictable. The novel's opening is quite interesting, given the part that a story is being told by a narrator you're not sure to trust. I truly like severely damaged protagonists so it really is a plus for me. Rachel is a one memorable character, but unlike Gone Girl, I think the sense of betrayal as one unravel the twists and knots of the story is not as grave. Middle part has slow tugs but then picks up again on the second half. I also like the idea of three different narrators presenting their own perspectives that interconnects in solving the puzzle. I'd give it a three for the plot itself, but I'm clicking four, mainly because of the sympathy I felt for Rachel, the hatred that I invested for Anna, and estrangement I had for Megan. OH YES, dear reader (spoiler alert), of course it's Tom. That bastard."
2170,Iman,Possibly one of the best thrillers I've ever read. The twists towards the end was the highlight. And the feeling of sitting at at the edge is one that's hard to shake off while reading this book. The only thing that bugs me is the ever changing POV. I give this one an easy 4 stars.
2171,Froggie,"It started slow but kept my interest through out the book. Faster pace than Gone Girl too! I understand why the publisher trying to ride the Gone Girl train for this book. (pun intended) There is a girl, or actually a woman, and she's missing, leaving her husband a suspect. There are cheatings involved and everything isn't what meets the eyes.All three audiobook readers performed well. Megan's narrator was a bit inconsistent though. There were parts she was exceptional and gave me chills and some part that the cadence of her voice was so wrong it took me out of the story. But all in all, highly recommended both the novel and the audiobook format."
2172,Kris,Enjoyed this very much.
2173,Elsa,"Opinião publicada no Efeito dos Livros...A facilidade com que nos embrenhamos nesta história, seja por simpatia com a drástica Rachel, com a inconformada Megan ou a ligeiramente paranóica Anna, é um ponto a favor, já o outro é mesmo as migalhas de informação que nos vão sendo dadas e que nos levam até ao final, até à descoberta do enredo. E raios, se eu não desconfiei do/a culpado/a desde o início...Ler mais..."
2174,Nikki Mcgee,"I read this in one day and I suspect that it was a case of the right book at the right time. I was in need of something that I could read and enjoy without too much brain power or effort and this was the book.It is not overly original and there are definite shades of similar thrillers such as ""Gone Girl"", ""Into the darkest corner"" and "" Before I go to Sleep"". It is at times a little slow and repetitive which means it loses some of its thriller status but still a good read."
2175,Vani,"Si bien todos los personajes del libro me parecieron re loquitos e inestables y dejando de lado el hecho de que cierta parte del ""secreto"" era bastante obvia, fue un libro muuuy bueno.Algunas partes se me hicieron pesadas, pero no por la escritura o lo que sea, sino porque NECESITABA RESPUESTAS!! Así que me impacientaba y decía ""necesito leer el final"" y bueno... mi otra Vani NECESITABA SPOILERS!Más allá de ese gran dilema de spoilers, el suspenso fue bastante bien construido y no pude dejar de leer hasta terminarlo :3 "
2176,Abhishek,"The quality of mystery/thriller novels like The Girl on the Train can be gauged by answering this question, how further were you into the book before you stopped caring about figuring things out? Author Paula Hawkins understands this well enough, and juggles the narration of her story in such a manner so as to keep that mystery alive till the end. And oh, she does that quite wonderfully indeed! The Girl on the Train is the story of a divorced, jobless, alcoholic woman Rachel who takes the same train each day to commute to the city. On her train journey, at a particular signal, she peeks in the lives of a happy couple living close to the tracks, whom she calls Jess and Jason. One day, she sees something in their house which would break her views about the couple and plunge her into a dark and sinister mystery. The story sounds like a version of Hitchcock's Rear Window, and it is, to begin with. But as the story moves forward, the reader is taken deeper into the lives of Rachel, Anna (who is Rachel's ex-husband's current wife) and Megan (aka Jess), and how they intertwine with each other even when they are not aware about it. The book moves through different POVs, though Rachel is the key narrator in the story. But by mixing things up with different narrators as well as moving around a bit back and forth in time, Paula Hawkins makes this story much more interesting than it would have been in the form of a linearly narrated detective story. The thrill which you will get from reading The Girl on the Train arises from the form of writing, as if you are reading someone's diary. The characters themselves are not that likable, each with his or her set of serious problems, but there is no way you can keep the book down till the mystery is resolved. The book is being adapted into a movie by DreamWorks, with the director already chosen. I can see the appeal of making it into a movie - it has the kind of tension and drama that made Gone Girl such a big hit recently. But whether the movie works or not, Paula Hawkins' book deserves a read! "
2177,Banner,"This has been compared to Gone Girl in several reviews and while I get that, the books are more different than similar. This is not as dark yet it has a psychotic flavor that builds suspense throughout the story. The characters are flawed but yet manage to be likable or at least they gain our sympathy. The plot could have been hard to follow, but the story was well written and kept me guessing (even though I was not super surprised by the ending it could have easily gone a different way).I enjoyed the book and recommend it to lovers of mystery!"
2178,Larissa,3.5 stars but great as audiobook
2179,Maria,"Great read. Did find it a bit confusing at the start with the characters, once I got that sorted I couldn't put it down. "
2180,Joana Fernandes,"Em primeiro lugar, parabéns a mim: consegui ler 21 livros até agora, desde Janeiro! Passei o meu desafio do Goodreads! Este livro em particular ajudou: despachei-o em menos de nada, 90% num só dia. Não posso dizer que seja o melhor livro do ano (sobretudo tendo em conta os que li ao longo destes últimos doze meses), mas concedo-lhe a capacidade de me manter agarrada e a ler compulsivamente como há meses não me acontecia. E é tão bom quando isso acontece.As personagens não são fáceis de gostar, mas não são menos reais por isso; aliás, bem pelo contrário: talvez o facto de serem tão reais seja exactamente o que nos faz sentir alguma pena, repulsa, crítica pelas suas acções desconexas e por vezes, deploráveis. O enredo é um pouco estranho, mas tratando-se de um thriller, é de esperar.Rachel Watson tornou-se alcoólica devido à frustração por não conseguir engravidar, e o seu casamento desmoronou. Agora, na casa onde morava com tanto gosto e que mobilara à sua imagem, mora a nova senhora Watson com o ex-marido de Rachel. E todos os dias Rachel olha para esta casa de dentro do comboio, a caminho de um emprego que também deixou de existir, e que existe apenas de fachada. Durante esse mesmo percurso, Rachel vê também uma outra casa, alguns números acima da sua, e o casal que nela mora. Todas as manhãs, Rachel projecta nestas duas pessoas o casamento perfeito, aquele que teve durante um tempo e que terminou, imaginando as suas vidas, a relação que os une, o seu dia-a-dia. E, por isso, é com grande choque que, do comboio, Rachel assiste a uma cena que a perturba a nível profundo, e que a vai fazer investigar por conta própria um crime e descobrir a relação disso com a sua própria vida. Mais não posso dizer.Este livro ganhou o prémio da categoria de Melhor Thriller e Mistério do Goodreads. Se é merecido, não sei. Como disse, não é um livro particularmente marcante, mas lê-se de forma muito fluída e acessível, o que, associado à curiosidade que desperta, faz com que o leiamos rapidamente.Gostei bastante. Recomendo como leitura entre livros mais pesados e complexos, para uma leitura despreocupada e cheia de suspense."
2181,Jennifer Cason,"With all the comparisons to ""Gone Girl"" I was worried I'd be reading a carbon copy, but aside from the dark ""who done it"" vibe, I didn't catch any direct Gone Girl influences. This book stands alone very well with a protagonist so believable, tragic and flawed that sometimes you physically cringe on her behalf. My only criticism is the ending felt a little drawn out. Once we had all figured out the villain, it felt like a bit of a waiting game for it to end, but overall I thoroughly enjoyed this book. "
2182,Denise Vasak,"This book was a quick read and it held my attention. Every once in awhile I felt like there was filler text but the story picked back up quickly. The story is told through multiple narrators but is not confusing so long as you pay attention to the date in the chapter title. This next part really isn't spoilerish but if you want NO information going in - DON'T READ ANY FURTHER!!I HATE adulterers - it rubs me the wrong way so from the start I hated, HATED Anna. That opinion never changed for me. I never felt bad for her, never worried for her - whatever. She made her bed, she can lie it! I like Rachel in the beginning but then I found her frustrating and annoying. I suspect someone with an addiction would make me feel that way and I didn't love it. I wanted to be done with her but she kept trying just enough for me to hold out hope for her. She was a mess, all of them were. Ugh...I liked that I didn't exactly see the ending coming. I had my suspicions but I didn't really decide until it was almost revealed so I always count that as a success.I also liked that this author didn't really fool with unnecessary information. I like detail and all I just don't need 20 pages of it plunked down all together for me so I was happy that she wove the descriptions into reflections/pertinent details. "
2183,Kellie Simpson,"Im a huge fan of thriller novels, particularly psychological thrillers...and I enjoyed this one. PROS: Well written, thoughtful and detailed. Each chapter is artfully pieced together, with just enough detail inform the reader and enough ambiguity to keep the reader in the dark. I appreciated that I didn't suspect the killer until I was supposed to (although alot of other readers said they found it predictable).The most interesting part of this book is, of course, the narration and lack of credibility. For me, this made the book seem realistic. Each character has their own messed up view on the world, prefaced by real world struggles (eg. infertility, depression, cheating). Incorporating multiple narrators allows the reader to fill in some of the gaps in each persons story, and in turn, I was able to come up with my own theories of what was going on instead of being entirely guided by any one narrative. It also made me believe that every character was a suspect at some point, which is hard to do and it makes for an awesome read.CONS: Pacing - I found myself struggling to get through once I reached the 75% mark. There's alot of back and forth between the main character and others that I found to be unnecessary. (view spoiler)Plot holes - I found that there were some things lacking explanation in the book. Not so much the main story..it resolves itself nicely in the end, but there were characters in the story that showed up, and then we don't know what happens to them? (view spoiler) Lastly, I would have liked to see more differentiation between narrators. The writing is exactly the same throughout, where it should have been more distinct and at times I would have to refer back to the beginning of the chapter to know who I was reading about.Overall, I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to any other psycho-thriller lovers. The reason I didn't give it a 5 was because of the cons I identified, it prevented me from ""loving"" the book. P.S. I have never read Gone Girl so have no comparison there."
2184,Sherry Cooper,"I really enjoyed this book - in fact, I couldn't put it down in the way that I found myself picking it up just to see what would happen next. The characters were very well developed - I could feel each of them especially Rachel. Definitely worth a read."
2185,Tara Layne,"I have mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand, I felt it was well written and so amazingly suspenseful. For that, it gets four stars. On the other hand, with the exception of maybe Cathy - a secondary character - every single character in this book was deplorable. It was hard to root for any of these characters because I kind of hated them all. "
2186,Sfjtsnow,Enjoyed it but did figure it out read it and see if you can too
2187,April,This was a page turner for sure. I liked the multiple perspectives and getting into the psyche and motivations of each main character. The complexity of the characters and the plot twists made this a great exciting read 
2188,Rachael Mazur,"Overall a good suspense novel. My interest was piqued when many of the reviewers compared the novel to ""Gone Girl."" Unlike ""Gone Girl"" though, I found ""Girl on the Train"" to be a bit more predictable. This who-done-it novel kept me engaged enough that I wanted to see it through to the end, but the main character Rachel at times was a bit whiney for my taste. "
2189,Tiago Henriques,"Gone Girl-ish thriller that starts slow and overuses the whole ""I got drunk and did a bunch of stuff and don't remember any of it"" plot device, but I was engaged throughout."
2190,Edwardt66,Enjoyed the read. 
2191,Joanna Ellis,"Intense read. I really enjoyed it and had a hard time putting it down. I could have done without some of the language, but overall really liked it. "
2192,Joao Barcelos,"Really easy read. Along the way you get a bit annoyed by some characters, but the story is well built up. Cool ending. "
2193,Kathleen DeStefano Pennington,"The Girl on the TrainThe novel is based mainly in Rachel, a commuter on London's rail line. As she travels passed the home she once shared with her husband, she can't help but wonder about the residents she sees outside their homes, and how her lonely life and vivid imagination add to the evil that occurs at 15 and 23 Blenheim Street. "
2194,Valerie Karpeck,"I would probably give this 3 1/2 stars bit I rounded up. Told from the perspective of the female characters, this book kept me guessing through three quarters of it and I loved that about it. It's getting compared to Gone Girl quite a bit, but to me was a very different read. A quick read and a good one."
2195,Selen Üstüncan,Çok fazla bu tarz kitaplar okumayan biri olarak vasatın üstünde bir kitap olduğunu düşünüyorum. Başkalarının aksine ben katili kesinlikle son sayfalara kadar tahmin edemedim. Beklentiyi yüksek tutmadan merakla okunulası bir kitap.
