0,Bailee,"The Catcher in the Rye, written by J.D. Salinger is about a teenager, Holden Caulfield, who is having troubles letting go of his childhood and maturing into a young adult. Holden doesn't feel like he fits in anywhere and that is what takes him on this journey to find himself. One weakness of this book is that the plot is not intriguing at all. There are no foreshadowing, no wondering what's going to happen next, and no cliff hangers. You get to hear the main character, Holden, talk about how miserable his life is over a course of three days. Another weakness of this book is that this novel is very slow with a story being told and then all of a sudden the main character is talking about something else that is irrelevant to his story. Overall, I would not recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a book filled with action, mysteries, or anything else in that matter. This novel is very boring and dull. You never really know how much a person can complain until you have read The Catcher in the Rye. "
1,Mary Ronan Drew,"What is all the fuss about this weak, juvenile novel? Second reading 10/10/2013The 22nd Avenue Book Club chose this as our November book and so I reluctantly re-read it. It's worse than I thought. I was tempted to write a parody review and all but it was just too goddamn easy."
2,Annabel,"I had to read this for my AP English Language class and it was the most pointless book ever. I honestly didn't care about his feelings and the book was going nowhere. The fact that I have to write an essay on this book is very UGH.If you're thinking about reading this book, dont read it(: trust me, I'm saving you from torture."
3,Mary-Anna,"I don't care how famous this book was, or if it was a classic, it was boring. The main character was dull, uninteresting, and annoying to listen ramble on. I could not manage to finish reading the small thing."
4,Leah,"No words can describe my hatred for this book. Just. urgh it's one of those books that you either love or you hate, and I hated it. "
5,Julie M,"YUK. I think I disliked this book even more on the reread (first read in mid 70's??). Guess I can't relate to the main character even though I know it's supposed to be a classic coming-of-age, teenage angst novel of its era. Doesn't age well IMHO."
6,Burak,"I would not want to be so judgmental on a literary work but I have never regretted reading a book in my life until I read this one. Total waste of time, highly overrated literary piece. Lack of style and plot. Nothing even remotely good about this book from beginning to the end."
7,Carrie Waibel,"Gosh, I just didn't connect with this one, but I would genuinely like to talk to someone who did. I'm thinking I just missed the boat."
8,Sthep Liar,"Tal vez un clásico, pero un fiasco para mí."
9,Annette,"Definitely one of the worst books I've ever read. ""This book should not be tossed aside lightly but hurled with great force"" - love this quote, but can't remember who said it."
10,Sammy Krupski,"I started to read this novel, but had to put it down. I feel bad for not liking it - because it seems so popular, etc. "
11,Eric DeVries,"I've heard people say this is one of their favorite books of all time, but I absolutely hated it. Holden Caulfield is almost unrealistically whiny, and since he narrates the entire book, reading The Catcher in the Rye is almost painful. The plot deals with Holden hopelessly struggling to connect with the various people around him, but he is too awkward and conceited to do it. He's also a complete hypocrite, complaining about ""phonies"" when he himself frequently acts like someone he is not. There's supposed to be some kind of social commentary in Holden's sniveling but I couldn't make myself care about it. Don't read this book."
12,Cheesekate,"Pourquoi n'ai-je pas aimé ? Peut-être parce que j'aurais dû lire en anglais, pour trouver moins insupportables les tics de langage de cet adolescent insupportable. Ma faute donc. La couverture annonçait ""phénomène littéraire sans équivalent depuis les années 50"", ça devait bien vouloir dire quelque chose.Sauf qu'il ne se passe pas grand chose d'intéressant, et que le moindre évènement inintéressant est forcément ponctué des milles défauts de langage de Holden Caulfield, celui que je ne me résous pas à appeler le héros tant il est antipathique. En approchant de la fin, il regagne un peu de mon affection, ou de ma pitié plutôt. Et on me donne un peu l'espoir que la fin va en valoir la chandelle. Mais non.La fin m'a laissée comme l'ensemble du livre. Et je n'ai pas d'adjectif approprié qui me vient..."
13,Chris Heathcote,"It was a horrible book, it really was. The whole time I was reading it I couldn't wait for the end so I would no longer have to read it. By the end I was hoping he would just end his life. "
14,Yilin Wong,"It's such a famous book and I have people recommend it to me. But to be honest I'm not impressed at all. It was interesting when he first started talking about phony and nice, but after reading them so many times I just get tired.It could be that I'm not in high school any more so that I can't enjoy it. But still I'll say that I think The Diary of a Part-Time Indian is a way better book than this one,I won't recommend it."
15,Kristi Wyatt,"I read this book several years ago and didn't really follow it well. I know it is a classic, but classics often don't resonate with me for some reason. "
16,Tag Riggs,"This is a book about self indulgence. A boy who thought the world revolved around him and we, the readers, were forced to listen patiently to his vents. No wonder Salinger became a recluse after writing such a book."
17,Lily Pollard,"While I understand that this book is seen by many as a ""cultural classic"" and continues to be taught in English classrooms commonly, I have never been so bored reading anything. Yes, there's symbolism and teenage angst and rage. Got it. But the style lacks anything other than an ability to ""connect to readers"" for which it has been so often praised. It is not poetic, it is not profound, it is hardly even descriptive. Maybe I'm too old to read this book and connect with its angsty protagonist, or maybe I'm not old enough to connect to the things that he complains about throughout the whole novel. "
18,Mith,"A friend recommended this book to me one day, assuring that it is “an amazing book” and that it would “change my life”.It isn’t and it didn’t.To be fair, this book deals with teenage issues, like angst and rebellion, and I was way past all that when I read it so maybe I wasn’t able to relate to it better.The book follows the story of the main protagonist, Holden Claufield, who gets expelled from his school, packs up and runs away to New York in the middle of the night, instead of returning to his parent’s home as he’s scared of what they might say. He then spends three days there, going dancing with complete strangers and employing the services of a prostitute just to get rid of the loneliness he’s feeling.He eventually sneaks back home to talk to his little sister, Phoebe, whom he adores and who is the only person in the world he can “talk” to. While there, he shares a fantasy with her about him wanting to become the guardian of a group of children playing in a rye field at the edge of a cliff and catching them when they get too close to the brink – a Catcher in the Rye.The rest of the story is about Holden meeting his old English teacher, Mr. Antolini (who offers him advice on life - “A weak man is willing to die for a cause but a strong man lives humbly for one.”) and then deciding whether he wants to go back home and “face the music” or not.Even though the book has its moments, I’m not too sure of the message it is trying to send through. Holden is portrayed as a cynic who just about mistrusts every adult and labels each as a “phony” as they are “very superficial and are ""full of pretences”. He always sees something bad in everybody and is shown running away from his fears instead of facing them.The entire book has a very bleak and depressing tone to it and I would not recommend anybody to pick it up when they are already down as it will just push them over the edge (A mistake I made). Worth a read for anyone going through or trying to understand “teen angst” but it is definitely not my cup of tea."
19,Amber Jones,"My birthday present to myself is to give myself permission to not finish this book. I normally push thru to the end, but I just can't do it. This book is pointless and torture. If my children come home and tell me they have to read this book, I will happily buy them Clif's Notes and send them on their way. Happy Birthday to me--Catcher in the Rye--you are going back to your owner tomorrow to no longer grace my nightstand. I fare thee well!"
20,Andres Pasten,"A lo mejor es de gusto de los criticos. Para mi fue la historia de un pelmazo de buena cuna y pocos amigos, o sea alguien que lo tuvo todo y eligio tirarlo por la ventana, mientras narra sus aventuras mentales. Una lata."
21,Maureen,Sorry...
22,Hien,Maybe because I am 35 years-old but I thought this book was very frustrating and boring. Holden to me was a bored rich boy that complained about everything and everyone. I could not help but want him to fail so that he can realize how good he had it. I know there are some teenagers that can relate to Holden's feelings and thoughts. But i just hope they are going through a phase and will snap out of it when they grow up. 
23,Noha,It was totally useless to read this novel. I do appreciate the confusion which Holden is in (I could relate to it myself)but it was boring and mere. I did not feel even any sympathy for him. I would not recommend it. P.s: my ignorance in literature is more than my knowledge so you ought not to depend totally on my opinion and to check others :) 
24,K.C. Beaumont,"I uncovered a copy of this book while cleaning out a spare room and recalled reading it in HS. As it turns out, I was mistaken. Also, I gave up on it.I realize it's a telling of breaking out of the ""respectable young man"" mold and even helped pave the way for the anti-Vietnam War movement, but I did. Not. Like. It. Holden Caulfield annoyed the crap out of me, and I struggled to find any redeeming qualities in the boy. Of course, he could have very well redeemed himself later in the book, but I didn't care enough to find out. "
25,Hank Davis,"Classically shit. Even more boring than Hemingway's laziest drunken scrawls. Had to force myself to finish it. Much like eating Brussel sprouts, but alas there is no dessert to follow....also responsible for giving us wide use of the incredibly crap word; phoney."
26,Sushi ♥,"You know what they say, there are only two kinds of people, those who can understand and love Caulfield and those who can't and abhor him.I unfortunately am one of those people who can't stand him or this book. "
27,Thomas,"Cards on the table: I listened to the audio book version of this. I'm really glad I did, because I'm pretty sure attempting to read it would make me pluck my eyes out. At least I managed to do things while being bored senseless. Everything this kid does is boring as shit. Somehow - and I think this deserves a round of applause - he manages to make hiring a prostitute boring. ""What I really felt like, though, was committing suicide"". I wish you would, Holden. I wish you would so you'd shut the fuck up."
28,Krissy Rusnok,"Rarely do I ever find a book that I generally dislike. Very slow. Only enjoyable part of the book was at the end. Being an adolescent has its battles but Holden refuses to care about anything, school, friends, the future. There is no reason for this. Just is. "
29,Courtney Leigh,"Not exactly sure why this is a classic. I read it in high school, and I could never connect to Holden or his story."
30,Lesa,"It appears that this is one of those ""love it or hate it"" books and, sorry to say, but I didn't like it and had to force myself to finish it. The kid was so annoying! Such a self-centered drama queen. I couldn't find any redeeming qualities about him. And I didn't care for the language. The GD word every sentence got old REALLY fast. I can't say that I regret reading it, as it is a classic and now I know what it's about, but I won't be reading it again."
31,Sara W,"I hated this book when I read it in high school. I suppose I could give it another try, but it just seems like a waste of time."
32,Paul,"I had to read this book sophomore year in high school, and I can honestly say that I have no idea why we studied it or why its studied at all. The characters, especially the main character, were all annoying and a pain to read. "
33,André,"I hated this book and I still do. Holden's character is badly presented and not authentic at all. The story is boring and pseudo-pubertary. Boring. Even worse when we had to read it again in English, a few years later."
34,Sandy,I read this in high school...many years ago. I was surprised when my daughter also had to read it when she was in high school. I though it was boring and difficult to get through back in high school...my daughter thought the same thing when she was required to read it.
35,Arielle,"This was a terrible book? Why is it a classic? 200 pages of a spoiled rich kid complaining about how phony everyone else is, when he's just as bad as them? He doesn't appreciate what he has -- not my type of book. :("
36,Melisa,"I did not like this book at all. It was all the time depressing and weird. Nothing funny, nothing witty. Full of swearing and thoughts about killing. And I mean - what was the point of it? Really? If there was some kind of message, then i certainly did not get it. I just read more than 200 pages from a guy who is just an idiot. Seriously. I am very disappointed. (Remember that this is my opinion, and if yours is different, then thats completely normal)"
37,Avel,"I don't see the appeal of this book at all. It's an angsty kid roaming around getting drunk, smoking and judging everyone. There was no plot."
38,Philippe Malzieu,"A cult book venerated by generations. However not for me. I never managed to read it. However God knows how many time I try to read it. Everyone has book which resist to him. Often it is Proust or Joyce, for me it is Salinger. I do not explain. Can be the reality of the campuses so stranger for me.I will try again."
39,Dan Porter,"I think Holden is supposed to be a phony. I think that's kind of the point, that's he's so oblivious to his own problems because he's focused on everyone else. In a way Holden's phoniness is part of his obsession with innocence and Allie's death. Holden gets so upset over Jane going out with Stradlater, and the real reason he wouldn't sleep with the prostitute, and why the grafitti in the museum makes him so mad, and a hundred other little things in the book. Holden wants to protect the innocence of everyone around him, and he's mad at people who have already lost theirs, and he's mad at people who try to take it from others. But Holden himself is no longer innocent, and if he's honest with himself then that means he has to deal with the fact that he doesn't live up to his own standards. However, if Holden has to worry about fixing himself, he can't devote his time to protecting Pheobe and the others, so it's easier for Holden to deny his own problems and worry about everyone else. Holden's realization at the end with the carousel and allowing Pheobe to try to grab the ring is important not just because it symbolizes Holden letting go of Allie, or realizing that he can't protect Pheobe forever, but also because if opens the door for Holden to focus on himself."
40,Chad Ponton,"I picked up a copy of this book, simply because I have never read it. It took me almost 6 months to slog through this mess of a novel. The main reason I did not like it, was that he came across as a spoiled little rich kid, who is mad at the world simply because he has to grow up and be something.I am in my mid 30's, and was raised in a small family. There is a possibility that my upbringing may have influenced my opinion. We were not rich, but money was tight, and there were a lot of things I wanted - but never 'needed' any true necessities. After finally finishing this book, I gave it away to the local library. "
41,Tigertiger,"This book is the absolute worst thing that I have ever read and will ever read. I WISH I COULD GIVE THIS BOOK NEGATIVE STARS.I read this book for my ninth grade English class. My teacher got all my classmates hyped about this book but I was unimpressed. It is just about Holden's annoying and pointless complaints about everything. He goes to bars and calls up a prostitute. Holden does absolutely nothing constructive and I hated it. I wanted to strangle him the whole and it pained me to find that there were still pages left to read.J.D. Salinger had no writing skill at all. I think that my first grade cousin could write better than this. Every two words was a curse or phony. I didn't Holden relatable at all, except for maybe a drunkard. My teacher would always say how much she adored this book to my class and they agreed. This is the first book that I have really and truly hated with all my heart. This book is an insult to all books known to man and I will never recomend this to anyone,anywhere. "
42,Matthew,Didn't understand why it drove Mark Chapman to shoot john lennon! Admittedly i read it a long time ago when i was a mere boy!
43,Julie Ann,"Why so bitter, Holden. You can't go on life judging everyone. This is what I think about this book. :( I tried, though. I tried liking this book, but maybe not now. :/"
44,Samantha Williams,"Honestly, I found the book to have no good clear direction. Most of the time I sat there wondering where the heck it was going. I dreaded reading it because it was so aggravating to watch Holden act so stupidly, which ultimately led to my procrastination of reading the book. I looked forward to finishing it and just being done with it. I know that it's a classic and that many people love it, but it just doesn't appeal to me."
45,Kailee Shaw,"Bar hopping and kicked out of school Holden finds himself stuck in The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger and I did not like it. It was a very quick read. I liked that the main character is very honest from the first page to the very last page. Holden was a very weird person but I think it made the book better than if he was just a normal guy. After getting kicked out of school he spends what seems like forever going to different hotels and bars trying to decide what he is going to do with his life. Run away and go west or go home to his sister Phoebe? He only had a couple days to decide what he was going to do before he was expected to be home for Christmas break. I didn't like that the plot jumped around a lot, it made the book kind of hard to keep up with. It reminded me a lot of the book Perks of being a Wallflower. Both Charlie and Holden are trying to figure out what to do with their lives and resort to getting help. I would recommend this book to people that have read Perks of being a Wallflower and liked it or someone that is just looking for a quick read. "
46,Shahrin,"I hated this book. I hate the main character, there was no real resolution in the ending. I hate. This book."
47,Jinx,"It's been quite a while since I really hated a book and the main character… But this book actually got me pretty fast to the point, where I was asking myself after every page why I keep reading that book… My Dad read it about two years ago in the German translation. I read the first two pages of that edition and liked it… Can't imagine why now… I put it on my to-read list after that and read it in the English original (because I don't read translations of English written books.) When I started to read it I didn’t know what it was about. Well… the storyline is very simple. Holden Caulfield is a teenager, who just got kicked out of school again and can't get his life together. For him everyone is a phony. He is constantly bugged about everything… The book covers only a few days. He constantly screws everything up. He buys a record for his little sister and breaks it. He has a date with a girl he doesn't actually like but he declares his love anyway. He delays to tell his parents about him being expelled. Like it makes a difference… Just to name some… I probably couldn't remember everything even if I tried, because my thoughts constantly drifted away. I didn't like the writing either. The way it was written just bothered me. He constantly repeats the same phrases like ""that just killed me"". It would be a good book if he actually got killed all those times… "
48,Dianne,"When I finally got around to reading it-way past adolescence- I was so disappointed. This book is mentioned every day everywhere in print and I don't know what I expected, but this wasn't it."
49,James Pritchert,I can honestly say I hated this book. Sure I know its a wonderful classic and all that but really. Why would a school system force a student to read this if they really cared about them? I may have to read this again just to reinforce that I still hate it.
50,Hailee,"J.D. Salinger's purpose in writing this book was a failed attempt at entertaining, but somehow achieves the purpose of some people relating to it. This book tries to catch your attention, and then disappoints you because nothing exciting ever happens and there is no climax. The theme in this book is to not become a phony, rich, spoiled kid, or raise one. Holden thinks he is misunderstood, which seeing as I find him repulsive, maybe he is. He has been kicked out of several schools because he never applies himself. He never applies himself because he knows that his parents will not do anything to him except enroll and ship him away to another school. This book is a narration and partially a description. It is a narration because it tells of Holden's three day journey in New York City, with some flashbacks to his childhood. I say it is partially a description because it tells the events of Holden's story, but it did not make the reader (at least myself) feel like they are experiencing it first-hand. It is hard to relate or feel anything for Holden because he is such a hypocrite and annoying. My opinion of the book, if you cannot already tell, is that I did not like it. Actually, I hated it. Going into the book, I thought I would like it because I had some friends that loved it. Then, at the beginning I was like ""Okay this is a little boring but something exciting will happen soon."" As I soon found out, that never happened. Holden is lonely, repulsive, and immensely annoying. Holden is very repetitive in everything he does. In his speech, which it seems like every other word is a curse word. He also brings things up over and over again. How he hates his teacher in his robe, how he loves his red hat and got it for only a dollar, how he hates Stradlater, how he does not care for Ackley, but still hangs out with him, ect. He is also repetitive in his actions. Holden is a very lonely guy, so he drinks a lot. He fails at reconnecting a relationship, he drinks, calls up a friend, and fails at reconnecting that relationship also. There was nothing that I liked about this book. There is nothing I would change about the book, except my choice of reading it. I have read a book that I had similar feelings about the characters with, ""Wuthering Heights"". Just like Holden, all the characters in that book are unlikeable, repulsive, and annoying. I hope I have better experiences with other classics that I choose to read. "
51,MercMel,"If you need a practical reason to hate this book, it caused the death of John Lennon. There. Every other reason is revealed in the droning, repetitive texts so exhausting that if you took out all the ""goddamns"" and ""phonies"" and ""and all""s, you'd have about a 14 page novel. But the worst part is that JD Salinger has no idea how to capture the mind of even the most cynical American youth. Somehow this has been hailed as the perfect example of relating to a teen audience, failing to respect the complexities of just any human being by reducing the protagonist to a one-note bore. To create any character as unrealistic and dare I say, ""phony"" as this little snotnose Holden is a literary sacrilege. Where are the ducks, Holden? Why is your shoelace a sellout, Holden? Why should you have to tie it, because it is phony? No, it REALLY, REALLY IS, isn't it? Ah yes, but also you love little kids? Hmm...you wanna save them in a magical fairyland where they never grow up, even though you are probably the last person any child would want to be around? I'm surprised this book didn't inspire Michael Jackson more than Mark David Chapman.Sexually naive, judgmental, and privileged beyond belief, there is not even the slightest social satire to back this Ben Braddock-esque creep. There are no reasons given as to WHY Holden's parents suck, WHY he feels the world owes him something...because there AREN'T. So Salinger gives us no reason to sympathize with this whiny little maggot. No sense of humor, no new ideas, a twist ending that is as pointless as the rest. And the worst part is, this is taught in schools to TEENS with the idea that THIS afterbirth is how we can somehow CONNECT with them. I'm sure there are worse books out there, but this could be a contender for the worst ""classic"" must-read (that I have been forced to read), and I recommend it to NO ONE, especially people who can somehow relate to it, because you just might kill a beloved cultural icon."
52,David J.,"This will be rather short since I have many books that I enjoyed to write about. I simply did not get this book. I know it is a classic, I know that many people worship Holden(sp), but I simply could not stand him. I did not trust a word he said and frankly did not care what happened to him. I simply wanted to get through the book. "
53,Sally,"I remember reading this book in the 12th grade. I hated it then and these thoughts continue to this day. I will 100% never read this book again. Thank god Salinger forbade anyone from making this into a movie because if Hollywood churned out an adaptation every few years, then I might rip my hair out. There was very little to redeem this book. Holden was a major SHIT. Spoiled, privileged assface who seems like he'll fit right into a John Green novel on a quest to bang the manic pixie dream girl. I don't mind unlikeable characters at all, but there is no room for an uncompelling protagonist in this world. What was worse was having to analyse Holden as if he was some complex creation and having to complete assignments as if he had ANY redeemable qualities. Simply put, Holden Caulfield is a basic bitch. The only thing I can laud Salinger for is his writing. I remember actually enjoying the book until I realized how thin the plot was. His writing also somehow managed to temporarily mask the literary shitstain that is Holden Caulfield. "
54,Balaji Krishnan,The worst I've ever read.
55,Nicole Blais,"Hated this book!!! This kid needed a job. I read it when I was in my 30's; maybe I would have thought differently if I had read it in my teens, but I don't think so. I wanted to live life way back then too, not whine about it. "
56,Michael Hartley,"This is considered a Classic? HOLY TRIPE! This book has no redemming value what so ever. Unless you consider foul language and lack of any moral fiber values. I did find myself curseing after I read this book, and it was too predictable. Page one I figured out that he was in an insane asylum."
57,Angeline Peterson,"I don't know why I detest this book so much, but I do. Perhaps, it's because I didn't understand it or perhaps it's because I was trying to find too much meaning in it. Either way, I thought it was boring and pointless."
58,Zarinna Êliza,I've tried to read this book twice. I didn't really relate to the character and the constant swearing was quite annoying so I gave up and read something else.
59,Medusagoddess,"I hated this book. I read it a few months ago as one of those that I was supposed to have read in high school and I HATED it. It was so badly written with a rambling storyline. Still, Im glad to say I have read it and glad that I will never have to read it again. "
60,Maitha,"In my opinion, I disliked this book from the beginning but decided to finish it. I felt that it wasn't fair if I judged the book without finishing. Anyways, first of all, the fact that he says ""depresses me"" a lot actually depressed me. It wasn't a page turner at all. The only time the main character is happy is the last paragraph which is the last page. It was a waste of time. A boring read. "
61,Jonah K," 	The catcher in the rye ever since its first publication has been referred to as one of the “best novels” in american literature. REALLY? I honestly think that the federal judge should have kept it behind the bars if it was goin too steal this much of a hype when it obviously does not deserve it. 	When I was reading this book, I didn’t feel like I was actually reading the story of a teen, but more like reading a story that a middle aged man wrote through the eyes of a white teenager kid. All the “godddams”, “hells” and “shits” in the world couldn’t cover it up. In fact , all the awkwardly used profanity was one of the factors that made me wish that this book was made in the world of farenheight 451. It might be because Holden existed in a different time and place and society as me, but , the way Holden Caufield talks seems to me like a japanese man trying to sing Elvis. Its just not the same. J.D Sallingers attempts to add frositng to the deal with all the immature profanity, but it seems to me that its all a sich too much. And if you ask me, teenagers don’t talk like that. Perhaps one of the editors should have pre-exposed the story to a teenager so that Salinger could have altered the way Holden talks.	I understand why so many proposes this book to teenagers though. Holden Caulfields reputation lives up to his title as a national symbol for rebellios, premature teens. Perhaps this book has given great influence to the lifes of some teens. BUT, in my oppinion he is hypocritical whiny emo kid unlike the . The pasimistic punk turns down sex even though he claims that’s all he ever thinks about. His emotion overruns his logic, causing him to get nowhere in life and once he gets the oppurtunity, He turns into a female cat. All of these features are presicley the kind of person that pisses me off. He complains about EVERY LITTLE thing, failing to appreciating all the magnificent things taking place in his life. This book may have influened millions of people to refelct and better them selves ….. and some to kill the beatles but nonethe less!, I didn’t learn nor feel anything after reading this book.But the annoyance caused by a single character dosent make this a bad book. In my oppinion, it seems that Sallinger concentrated too much on making this book “teenage like “ through out the whole storyline that it became stale after awhile. The scene where Holden mimmicks a broadway star and starts tapping in the showerroom, the man wearing womens clothing Holden saw through his hotel windows, All these scenes seems to be fairly korny to me and again it seems that Sallinger tried a bit too hard to add a senec of innocense and youth to the story that it seemed plastic.	This might be because of my lousy reading skills but it seemed to me that radther than having a meaningful plot, all this book was was 300 pages of a shallow white kid complaining about things I don’t care about. Some may call this type of plot simple yet insight, I call it boring. The story dosent have any ups and downs withing the plot causing the whole story to become flat and predictable, failing to make readers, or atleast me, to sit on the edge of the seats while reading this book. Through out reading this book, I was hoping that at somepoint there was going to be a changing point in the flow, something that would make the rest of the story worth reading, but the book failed me and made me say”that’s it?” when I completed the book. 	First of all let me say that I Love Humor. Whether it is in a movie, novel or everyday life. And I can honestly say, that I could have read this whole book with a stragiht face. As mentioned before all the jokes, sarcasm and occurings became stale almost right from the beggining. Perhaps this was because all the jokes were of similar taste and had no ups nor downs. Regarding the supposedly funny things that are presented in the story, It seems as if it could be funny if it was presented in a different context. A lot of the jokes actually has the potential of being quite comical but the form Sallinger presents ruins the joke, giving me the sensation that the joke is my enemy. 	Overall, Maybe I would recommend this book to extremley naiive teenagers but noone else. Pehaps I would have if Sallinger has changed the tempo in the story once in a while, I would have given it a better rating."

63,Stephanie,"This is considered a classic, I just could not get into it. Very slow "
64,Lisa C,"I know this is a popular book, but I didn't like it. Mostly because of all the swear words. I read the book as fast as I could just so I could get all those words out of my head. Aside from that, I don't remember much about it. Maybe I missed the point of it, I don't know."
65,Xtin Noelle,"I wanted to read this book because they say this is one of the best novels ever written. I just forced myself to finish reading it. Makes no sense, I totally dont get the story."
66,Timothy Boyd,"This is one of the top 5 worst books I have ever read in my entire life. The only reason it get's a 1 star rating from me is because there are no negative star ratings. The only way you should read this book is after being a prisoner for years in solitary confinement and it is the only book you are allowed. The only way I would recommend this book to someone is if I were a sadistic English teacher and wanted to watch it drain the life out of the students as they had to read and try to make sense out of it. I will never get the time back in my life I spent reading this book, the time would have been better spent giving myself an anesthesia free appendectomy."
67,Isabella Cisneros,"Catcher in the Rye, by J.D Salinger. An praised classic, and famous coming of age story. I recently read it my self, although I like J.D Salingers work I for a lack of better word hated this book. I found the character annoying and completely childish. The boy was given every opportunity and still acted poorly.I usually enjoy coming of age books but this book was different. I like how in coming of age books, or in any book the main character goes through change, for better or worse. But he stayed the same ignorant, stupid boy he has always been. Another thing I disliked abut this book was how the character to act grown by engaging in activity s as drinking and smoking. This just made him seem even more childish and ignorant. Although J.D Salinger has many great works I would not consider this one of them."
68,Jewels,"Perhaps I'm too old to really get the gist of the story. I know that when people have read it in high school, they seem to like it pretty well. Coming at it from a grown up perspective, it just seems like the main character is an immature, irresponsible spoiled brat. I realize that wanting everything to stay the same is part of human nature, but the reckless way in which he proceeded just looked as if he wouldn't make it to adulthood, not that he really cared. I just can't like this book."
69,Andy Kerckhoff,"I did not understand it as a young man. My English teacher raved about it, and I never caught even a shred of a glimpse of why anyone liked it. Perhaps at the hands of a great teacher, I might find it valuable, now that I am an adult."
70,Shannon,"I had to put this up here just so I could say how much I hated it. F you, JD Salinger, and your stupid pretentious character. That's right, hipsters, I hated Catcher in the Rye, bring it."
71,Jeanie,I am not a fan of this book. I read it because it is on the required reading list at my high school so I wanted to be familiar with the content of the book. I found the book to be quite dull.
72,Katie Lindquist,"The main character is a completely unredeaming jerk-off who I spent the entire book loathing. I have never understood why people love this book so, I really hated it."
73,Sarah Fugate,Should everyone read this at least once? In my opinion yes. Does it live up to the hype? No. It's not very good.
74,Jacintaclark,"I'm 15 years old and just read this book, personally I didn't like it much at all and I was very disappointed by it. The writing in it frustrated me so much to a point I didn't want to read the book anymore. I'm going to read it again in a couple of years. But at the moment I'm rating this book poorly "
75,Yoeun Pen,"I read this book in English class back in high school and hated it. As stated by others on here, either you can relate with Holden and love the book, or you can't relate with him and hate it. I'm definitely in the latter camp. Not all teens are selfish, whiney, full of angst and hate the world. That was a stereotype that I could never relate to—no matter how many songs, movies and books say."
76,Jonathanrivera,I did not like this book at all. His life didnt make any sense and he was doing stupid things the whole book. Holden is a very confused boy who really needs to a friend. Holden needs some type of motivation to keep him in class. The Cathcer in the Rye was so boring.
77,Kelsi,"I read this because it's a classic, but never had to read it for any of my classes. Overall, I wasn't impressed. At all. It took some determination to get through it, and it's only 214 pages long. If it were any longer I don't think I'd have finished it at all.Holden, the main character, curses every other word, and it lends nothing to the story. And really, there's not much of a story anyway. It follows the life of an awkward kid that seems a little mentally unstable and has some trouble with girls. That's about it...and while I understand that it's a ""coming of age story"" I don't think that's much of an excuse for this book. I feel like it was a waste of my time to read, and am grateful for my teachers in high school who chose not to have us read it."
78,Saira,"To be honest I didn't enjoy reading The Catcher in the Rye. I may of been going through problems of my own, the chararter, Holden, is always so negative. It seemed as if he absolutely hated everything about life. He had gone through a lot of problems. Getting kicked out of four schools for failing almost all of his classes, he smoked, and her was so negative and always upset about any little problem. This book gave me a lesson "
79,Jen,"As of right now I completely despise this book. I am not sure what was written that put the bad taste in my mouth, but I potentially am willing to give it a second shot."
80,Angela Sellers,"This book was the biggest waste of paper in the world! The whole time I read it, I was thinking, ""What is the point of this book?"" I had to ask my english teacher what the purpose of this book is. It is incredibly LAME!!! So many other author's book about a teenage boys should be considered classics, and NOT The Catcher in the Rye. "
81,Ivey,"This book was terrible. The narrator, a snobby and spoiled teenage boy, drove me utterly and uncontrollably crazy. It seemed like it wasn't a book, just an expression of this boy's criticisms of the world and how it was full of ""phonies"" and ""morons"". This is a horrid and annoying piece of work, yet a classic. "
82,Shannonpresler,"It is a wonderfully written portrayal of a narrow minded boy who routinely misses the complexity of other people because he is so certain that everyone is missing the grandeur of his own. He wanders here and there, angry, isolated and self-righteous. "
83,Pratik Malladi,"Was unable to understand. It's still a popular book so i'd rather not comment to much. You have to read each line twice to understand what he means, at least for an indian reader or a new reader."
84,Megha Chakraborty,Boring and disappointing. No story at all. 
85,June,I read enough of the book to know that there are a lot of other good books out there that don't use the Lord's name in vain or deal in blatant promiscuity! I hope my kids never had to read this for high school.
86,Talitha,"Just couldn't get into it as hard as I tried because it's such a classic. It seemed immature and, honestly, just boring. "
87,Arthur Rohman,"This was one of the most pathetic excuses for literature I have ever read. The protagonist's problems all stem from his sheer laziness and refusal to do anything productive with his life. If it were possible to give lower than 1 star, I would. I felt absolutely no relation whatsoever to the protagonist, and would rather take a bullet than be subjected to the nightmare of reading this atrocity again."
88,Kira Collens,it was boring
89,Peachy,"I didn't enjoy this book when I first read it in school, and my opinion of it didn't change much when assigned to one of my children. I think there are other books which show the particular writing style which are more interesting and expanding."
90,Pamela Pickering,"I had to add this after we briefly spoke about it in our last book club meeting. I suppose I would give this a 1.5 star rating, the 1/2 star reflecting that I actually finished it. I believe to appreciate this book you might have to be <18 years of age. Read it in my mid to late 20s and just didn't quite get it. The narrator was continually frustrated about people who complained, were apathetic, etc and every thing he complained about he was doing himself! I just wanted to say ""Look in the mirror, Dude!"". Can't remember much more than that but thought I had to share since it is frequently touted as an ""Amazing Book!""."
91,Isaac Cooper,"Nobody likes a bratty teenager, least of all me. I used to be one, and I didn’t like myself then, and whenever I see a bratty teenager it really gets under my skin. This is Holden Caulfield, perhaps one of the least sympathetic characters I’ve ever had the displeasure of reading. I don’t know about you, but I have better things to do than read sentences like:Grand. There’s a word I really hate. It’s a phony. I could puke every time I hear it.And you know what, Holden? I want to puke reading your goddamn sorry excuse for a book. I mean, how on earth can I care about this bratty turd when people are STARVING IN AFRICA and BEING FORCED INTO SEX TRAFFICKING and GETTING HOOKED ON HARD CRACK? No one cares about your petty little problems, you ungrateful asshat. Honestly, I mean … goddamn.So, apparently if I kept reading eventually the character would have to struggle with the death of two people close to him, or is already struggling with it? Well, the problem is I don’t care about the obnoxious character, and so I don’t care an ounce about his supposed sufferings. I really struggle to see how anyone could care about this character, unless, of course, they’re just like the disaffected, whinging youth that his Holden Cauliflower. The point is, shit happens in this life, right? Right. And in a good book, you care about this shit, you care about what happens to the character, usually because of a weakness in him that you connect to or … something, anything. The problem with Catcher in the Rye is that thousands of shitty teenagers are like this, which is probably why it’s so popular, but it doesn’t make me care at all as a reader. So many people have problems in this life, and when a whiney little brat complains and complains and thinks everything sucks, well, I don’t care where you’re from, that’s just shitty. So, in short, pop a fucking Prozac and get the fuck over it … fuck."
92,Alexandra Vasiac,"The most overrated book I read in the last years. It was just awful, a pain to read. "
93,Christina,Another book from high school required reading. This one was OK - but I haven't read it since sophomore year. I should probably give it another shot.
94,Adam Gutschenritter,"This book had everything I hate in a main character; running stream of consciousness and he was whiny. I understand that it is a perfect expression of teenage angst, but I couldn't have hated this book any more."
95,David Mathews,"This classic over the years has received quite the publicity. Banned from my library at or around 1982, I always wondered what the ""stink"" was about. Unfortunately ittook me38 yearsto finnaly get round to reading it. WHAT A LET DOWN! I'm not sure if maybe I read it too late in life or what but I was NOT moved. Not mentally ill enough to adore it. Or, the teenage angst is gone. Felt morelike slapping Holden Caulfield and telling him to ""get over it!"", than I did identifying with him. What a complaint machine. Check this one off the listas time wasted! The only controversy I witnessed was the overuse of the word God@#$%. Booooo!"
96,Christine,"I found this book incredibly disappointing. After all the hype that surrounds it, it left quite a lot to be desired. "
97,Danelle,"I read this for english and must say I don't really like it. There was just something about it that made me feel bored, though I must say the story was quite interesting I just don't like this writing style."
98,Olga,"truthfully i found this book annoying to read. thankfully i got it for cheap at a used book shop, because this book was terrible.it's a coming of age story of a no-good kid who hates EVERYTHING. i mean it. everything. does anyone know how annoying teenagers are? yeah. this whole book follows one incredibly obnoxious teenage boy who hates life. i can't understand why people like this book. i mean, who can relate to this? no matter how bad i thought life was at any given point, i did not hate it as much as this kid. who wants to read about someone who complains about everything?"
99,Miharu Rokujou,i really dont know why everybody likes this. i only read it because its one of those books everyone else has read and i decided to see what all the fuss was about. thought it was stupid.
100,Rhenus,"Quite possibly the most disappointing novel I have every had the displeasure of reading. Scores of people have told me they love this book and that it spoke to them, I see now that the book said ""I'm a self-centred snivelling little idiot, who believes he is better than everyone, and that my every thought is precious"" which they identified with.I honetly have read many better written books, with more engaging characters and far more interesting plots(not hard)that were written around the same time.So why does everyone rave about this book?It's a simple case of emperors new clothes, one influential critic says ""it's a fantastic introspective view of a teenager in the grasps of mental bedlam"" and everyone else follows suit because they are scared to look stupid or ignorant by comparison.This is not a good book."
101,Katie Marburger,Not my favorite...
102,Thomas Boyle,"Hated this book. Found Holden Caufield a horrible character. My English teacher allowed me to stop reading it as I disliked it so much. Tried again a few years ago, still disliked it, still don't know how it ends."
103,Ellie H,"This was one of the stupidest, most pointless, and most boring books I have ever read. I did not enjoy it at all. Why? Well, first of all… I hate Holden. I thought he was annoying, not the smartest, pessimistic, a womanizer, and strange. He didn't like anyone and just kept complaining and not really doing a whole lot throughout the book. I just kept wanting him to go die in a hole. For Reals. That's how much I didn't like him! However, I couldn't relate to him at all, so I guess that also plays into the fact that I didn't like him.These were my reactions to him and all he did…andI also didn't like how this book didn't have much of a plot. (view spoiler)[ Yes, Holden was kicked out of Pencey. Yes, he went to New York and kept contemplating whether or not to call his sister, Phoebe, and Jane Gahallager. Yes, he went various places and did various activities. But it was all pretty boring, and he didn't really have reasons for doing all he did. It was basically…"" I was bored so I did this then this then this"".  (hide spoiler)]Anyways, I had a hard time reading this story and even finishing it ( I was proud that I even finished it). It was horrible though. Absolutely atrocious. Do not read this book. Ever. "
104,Meghann,Crybaby prep-school boy gets expelled. Spends the rest of the time feeling sorry for himself and riding carousels. Over it.
105,Gabbi,"	The Catcher in the Rye, by J.D. Salinger, is the story of a boy named Holden Caulfield who is sixteen years old. Holden attends a boarding school called Pencey Prep. Pencey is the most recent boarding school that he has attended. Holden has failed almost every subject at every school he has attended, and therefore is expelled from every school. Holden doesn’t care much about anything and is sarcastic. The Catcher in the Rye is not the only novel written by J.D. Salinger. He also wrote a novel called Franny and Zooey, and a novel called Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction. 	The Catcher in the Rye is written in a plain style. The language the author uses is not interesting, and this makes the novel boring. Although the novel is boring, Holden Caulfield - the protagonist - is sarcastic and this occasionally makes the novel funny. For example, Holden tells many lies and does so in his typical sarcastic manner. This helps to break the monotony of the novel. 	The key weakness of the novel is the author’s writing style. It is dull. Many phrases and words are used repeatedly throughout the novel. The author often repeats phrases to emphasize a point. Phrases such as “ I really did,” are used over and over and this makes the descriptions in the novel boring. The most annoying part of the novel, though, is that Holden is very negative about everything that happens to him. Holden can twist anything that happens him into a bad situation. Holden always finds faults in the people he meets. He refuses to change his mind after his first impression of the person. The only thing that Holden seems to care about is his family. His sister, Phoebe, and his older brother D.B., are Holden’s real friends. Holden also thinks about Allie, his younger brother who died of leukemia, and it is possible that Allie’s death is the cause of Holden’s sarcastic bitterness. At no point in the novel does he become excited or happy and this makes the story rather dull.	Overall, The Catcher in the Rye is a disappointment. This is because it is not written well and the events that occur throughout the book are not exciting. It is difficult to recommend this novel to anyone other than someone who likes sarcasm and a careless character. "
106,DeLaina,"OK, so I am looking at book lists of all my friends, and almost without exception, EVERYONE except me has read Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger. Something is obviously wrong w/me so I borrow the book and dive in. It was like diving into a swimming pool that you think is going to be filled with lovely blue water...not so much...it was empty and I hit concrete.I waded through 62 pages and just couldn't take anymore so I skimmed the rest of the book. I get that Holden is supposed to be a spoiled brat, self-absorbed, egocentric, teenager riddled with angst during this coming of age tome. I just couldn't endure the various and sundry details of nothingness.Perhaps it's because I didn't read it during that time period of my life? I couldn't identify at all with Holden. The only thing it reminded me of was the 13 years that I taught HS, and I can definitely see how some of my Freshmen students could be going through the same types of things.Anyway, I've read a lot of other reviews and can see how it appeals to some people, I'm just not one of them I guess, but at least I can check it off my list of things to read! "
107,Sorcha Reilly,"i didn't like this book at all. i have read it twice to make sure, i have no idea how it has become so iconic. the main character is a whiny, arrogant teenager than just need to grow up and stop saying everyone is a phony. just awful."
108,Carmen Whitehorn,"I had one time created a list of censored books. This book was one of them and I had not read it. I basically read it to say that I've read it. For me, the book was rather boring. I am not sure why it is such a classical must read. Maybe because it was censored. One thing I do remember that I found interesting is the main character is making out with this girl tells her that he loves her and wants to marry her and at that moment, he means it. I guess its the ""at the moment, he means it"" that got me curious. I asked a guy that I worked with, (We were teenagers at this time) if guys feel that way sometimes. He said yes. He said spent one evening talking with a girl till early morning. He felt he could marry her. For some reason, I just found that interesting. 1 star because I read it. "
109,Muskaan,"I hated this book. Except for a very very few laughs it gave me, I got absolutely nothing from it. There was no plot and no climax in it. Absolutely no adventure.I couldn't relate to it in any way. And the repetitive phrases 'goddam made me so depressed for chrissake'.Holden is a 'goddam sonuvabitch' for being so 'goddam depressed and all'. I do not recommend it to anybody and I am never going to read it again in my entire life :vI wonder how the hell it came to be a classic :3 "
110,Kimclines,"I do not understand why this is a classic. I guess it's just a book that marks popular thinking of the time period, but I did not enjoy it."
111,Max Phoenix,I found this book to be very advanced read and it was interesting but I didn't enjoy the conflict of the story to an inured confilict 
112,Lil,"I hated this book. I know some people LOVE this book, and I don't see HOW. The plot was underdeveloped; the main character irritating. The whole book was about a kid narrating how he hates everything in life. "
113,Abi,"Well, this book certainly seems to be like marmite. My stance on it is, however, the opposite of my stance on that delicious glossy black, salty spread. I hate it.I read of people who work themselves into ecstasies over this as teenagers and then come back to it later and realise it's a load of old bollocks. Well, I read this when I was 16 or so and I could not stand it. I don't pretend to have been a particularly mature teenager, but this book certainly is not 'the universal depiction of the teenage mindset', or whatever people want to call it, because although I have been an insufferable know-it-all teenager of course, I was never so conceited as to really believe that I was graced with some special understanding of the world that my poor fellow human beings just didn't see. And I never thought that my own adolescent troubles were really all that serious, in the grand scheme of things you know. I had read The Gulag Archipelago. I mean, Christ, even the famously scorned David Copperfield has a harder life than Holden Caulfield. Salinger's callous narrator desperately needs some sort of perspective.The main character is exactly the sort of arrogant, self-obsessed, pseudo-philosophical, 'nobody understands me' teenager that I laughed at when I was that age, and I laugh at now. I sympathised with him, because he was clearly a neurotic little bastard of a drama queen, destined for a life fraught with problems of his own making, but I could not empathise. I think the best literature is based upon an desire to understand your fellow man, whatever failings we may have as a species, not to scornfully deride them all as 'phonies' whilst painting yourself as the only one with sufficient insight to see through all their crap. Holden Caulfield is, to put it crudely but accurately, a complete dickhead. I mean, he's almost worse than Morrissey. Actually, Morrissey is exactly what Holden would have grown up to be like. I have no patience with people who talk about him like he's the fucking messiah for the 20th century."
114,Sara,I'm sorry...I just didn't care for it...perhaps it's because I HAD to read it instead of CHOOSING to read it...
115,Brian,It should have a Minus rating. What a complete waste of my time. I wanted to see what the big controversy was with Lennon and Reagan being shot. I kept waiting for something to happen and it never did. 
116,Wendy Wright kall,"I had heard so much hype about this book and that it was ""a classic"". I was thoroughly bored and disappointed. I kept waiting for the good part...I'm finished and I never found it."
117,Rowan,"A ""classic"" of the White Male canon, this book depressed the fuck out of me. I was irritated by the author's continual use of the word ""crumby"" (and wish it had been spelled ""crummy"" at the very least) as well as how much time Holden Caulfield spends whining because his life of white privilege isn't quite privileged enough.If you liked your Freshman Lit class, this book is probably for you."
118,Lis,"So this is one of those classic books I somehow escaped reading during high school. Now I see how lucky I was. Gads, but Holden Caulfield is an annoying prat! I want to play a variant on a drinking game with this book, where, instead of taking a drink, I get to slap him every time he says ""Boy!"" or ""I did. I really did."" Maybe once upon a time it was an edgy classic, but now it's just inane and dated. "
119,D. Todd,"I was so disappointed in this ""classic"". I guess I had no idea what it was about prior to picking it up and I simply cannot say that I was impressed."
120,Bunny,"I think I should've read this back in the day, when I myself was a bratty 16-year old. As a bratty 26-year old, this book is just IRRITATING.I didn't like any of the characters. Except maybe the pimp. I did like the pimp."
121,Liz,"I appreciate this book for it's place in American culture, but Holden is a terrible character with no redeeming qualities. Just not my cup of tea."
122,Tabatha,"wow i heard such great reviews about the book and how it was the best piece of literaute to read. well when i started reading i expected this great book that caught me from the minute i started reading it. when i started it it wasn't, but i thought maybe if i read more it will get better. so i kept reading but nothing. at no point did the book grab me or catch my attention. i found it to be super boring. but i guess it's just because i normally read books about action and mystery. i would not recoimened this book to anyone who enjoys a sense of action in there book."
123,Jessiane Kelly,"Não acredito que para não ser um alienado a pessoa precisa ser como um Holden Caulfield: um resmungão, um infeliz, um desacreditado, um julgador e um relaxado. Se você tem consciência das coisas, não é um alienado, que tal você tentar mudar as coisas ao invés de resmungar o tempo todo? O livro inteiro ele não passa de um adolescente revoltadinho que tenta escapar dos problemas a qualquer custo ao invés de resolvê-los. A única coisa que salva o livro é o relacionamento de Holden e Phoebe, porque o resto não tem nada de mais. O livro não é essas coisas todas como todo mundo diz, não leia com tantas expectativas, vai se decepcionar se tiver esperando algo espetacular. "
124,Luke Macdonald,Quite possibly my least favourite book I have read. Very frustrating narrative and was never able to connect to anything within this book.
125,Tamra,"I hated this book. I hated the characters and I felt it offered me nothing in the way of growth, understanding, compassion . . . nothing. Well I guess that's not entirely true; I did learn how to string together many more swear words in one sentence than I ever thought I could. Really, what is the *#@%^$ appeal here? It was lost on me."
126,Jordan,"I had to read this book for school two years ago and was not able to get through it because of how bad it was and I didn't have enough time to push myself to finish it. I decided to retry it now because I figured it could not be as bad as I remembered. It was not, it was even worse. Holden is the most pretentious, annoying, ungrateful protagonist that I have ever had the displeasure of reading. He spent the entire novel complaining about phonies and pretentious a**holes, while he is the biggest one of all. For some reason, his reckless and stupid actions bugged me even more than his hypocrisy. Don't put yourself through the painful experience of reading it if you don't have to. I certainly won't ever again. "
127,Jack,"hectic as, finished this in 2 days.. i was glued to it from start to finish, which means that it must be a really mad book (or that it was just really short)"
128,Eleanor Pike,"Read this book to see what all the fuss is about & I was so disappointed!I really don't understand the point in this book. It's just a sixteen year old boy who complains about everything and is ridiculously bitter.Nothing gripping, nothing exciting, very boring.I read it until the end, but I'm planning on giving it to a charity shop."
129,Kay,"Truth be told, I don't get the appeal of this book. It's not enthralling, it's not enlightening, and it most certainly is not revolutionary. Just because a book has symbolism here and there doesn't mean it's remotely good. 90% of the thing is Holden talking about his boring life, complaining about fakers (or whatever he calls them, I don't really care), and trying his hardest to annoy the ever-living out of me. Goodreads describes him as edgy? Yeah, and Twilight was well-written. Try whiny, or immature for a change.Why is this even banned from schools? There's not that much explicit content in it, aside from Holden saying ""damn"" every other sentence, which is yet another reason he's so annoying. Seriously kid, stop saying ""damn."" We get it, you want to be cool, but you're not. Shut. Up. Do something. Have a plot. Engage me!I don't know. Catcher in the Rye was largely a character study, but I found it hard to look past Holden's irritating attitude and my inability to relate to him. I just didn't like it, and I don't think it should be studied in schools anyway. Stick to Shakespeare. At least Hamlet isn't a little brat like Holden. And, you know, the story's interesting. Figures my English teacher picked this out for me. School seems to have a real knack for picking the most God-awful books for me to sit through."
130,Jared,"I disliked this book. Caulfeild is a whiny, selfish, loser who spends all his parents money while complaining about his worthless life, but is too whiny and worthless to get off his butt and do something about it. I have no sympathy for the ""phonie"" loser."
131,Darla,"This book was decent, but I found myself crossing out all the swear words in it. And then to top it all off, the ending was quite disappointing. Not one I would recommend."
132,Breana Prayer,"I thought this book was really boring. I was like what type book is this. I really didn't read this book. Holden wasnt really talking about nothing important. It was just like he was just a talking and talking and talking. He had such a bad mouth. This is really not a book for kids.I really didn't like this book. I really dont have much to say about it. I will never read this book again. Maybe I did'nt like this book that much because it's not the type of books I read. Some people might have like this book, But I did'nt. Well you can read the book and tell for your self."
133,A,"I cannot stand this book. I don't understand how it has become as famous as it has, or why it's considered required reading in so many high schools. It's the story of a young man who screws up in school, spends his parent's money, alienates those around him, and complains. Oh lord, does he complain. I hate Holden Caulfield. He is an irritating, privileged, whiny boy who faces no consequences for his actions. He spends the whole book whining about how hard it is to be white rich and well educated. The book is boring and has no real closure. The only value I can see with this book is to show it to adults that complain about 'kids these days' as evidence that kids never change. "
134,Laurens,"The perception I got from Holden is that he is an impatient little brat who can't do anything but complain and pity himself. Everyone is a phony, and nothing is his own fault. In my opinion, it is really not easy at all to sympathize with him—I started reading this book on the recommendation that that is the case. Nothing is further from the truth."
135,Camilleigh,"Okay. Just listen. I totally understand how this book changed literature and how it made an impact on how books were written.But my god.I hated this book.I was really excited to read Catcher in the Rye after hearing nothing but good things about it, but I just thought it was dull, and I HATED Holden. He was whiny and pessimistic and he WOULD NOT STOP COMPLAINING throughout the ENTIRE book. Pretty much all he did was this:This person is a phony. That person is a phony. I went to a bar. They wouldn't give me alcohol. I met some people and they were all phonies. I thought of commuting suicide but then I didn't. I hate everyone. Everyone is a phony. Literally. All. He. Ever. Says. Is. PHONY!! Holden Caulfield is a negative, whining brat. Saying that he has mental issues doesn't make up for the fact that he's an unlikeable character. The Perks of Being a Wallflower has an extremely likeable character with mental health problems. Why can't Catcher? And there's basically no plot. It's just Holden walking around New York complaining and trying to drink and then once he meets someone, after a few minutes he decides ""oh, they're a phony"" and then he leaves and pisses and moans some more. Usually if I hate a book's protagonist then there are usually other characters that are likeable, right? Wrong. Holden is virtually the only character in the entire book, and even when other characters show up, they are boring, one-dimensional, and blander than bread. So, this book has a terrible protagonist, basically no plot, and nothing interesting.In all honesty, I really, really wanted to like this book. But I didn't. At all."
136,Savannah [LittleHearseDriver],When I finished reading this book I felt like throwing it across the room. I was completely pissed. Holden is a whiney brat who thinks he knows everything(like every teenager) and criticizes the rest of the world throughout the entire book. A complete waste of time.
137,Quinton,Absolutely horrible. I have no idea why this book is famous.Nothing happened.I did not sympathize with the narrator.I had to force myself to finish it.Very ready to move on.
138,Alexandre Reis,"Aos mais jovens, pela faixa dos 14 anos, talvez eu recomendasse a leitura do livro se outro melhor não estiver em vista. Mas, aos adultos, passem longe, bem distante deste título. Não se deixe levar pelo título lírico, poético. Sinto que desperdicei aproximadamente umas onze horas da minha vida lendo estas páginas. Bom, esta é a minha opinião mas respeito quem tenha gostado. "
139,Wilf,"Can't be sure but I probably came to this book far too late in life; the trials and tribulations of adolesence were but a dim and distant memory when I finally tackled ""Catcher"". I can recall friends waxing lyrical about this novel when we were all young, but I never got round to reading it then, just keeping it on my ""novels that must be read"" list. Would it have had more meaning for me if I had read it earlier? I just don't know, but in late middle age I found I just couldn't relate to the central character or his story at all. Judging from other reviews this is definitely a ""Marmite"" book and though I like the old yeast extract, I'm afraid Salinger's ""masterpiece"" proved unpalatable."
140,Carlos,"Hated the book. I could not bring myself to finishing. Why this book is a classic is beyond me. Holden is cynical and I hated his character. I did not want to read anymore. He belittles everyone surrounding him, except his sister. It was too depressing to finish. "
141,Jeanette,"Started -- couldn't finish. Couldn't handle the language. Still, I studied it because I wanted to know why it was so widely praised and talked about. Pretty sure I understand now. Still don't think it's worth subjecting myself to the amount of filth required in reading it so that I can first-hand ""hear"" how the hypocritical and ever-typical teenage-tunnel-visioned Holden hates all the phonies and has a hard time reconciling that life isn't the gumdrops and rainbows place you think it is as a child."
142,Chelsea D.,"I thought it was pretty disappointing...nothing in the book came out as exciting as I think it was planned; it just seemed kinda anti-climatical. Also the fact that there was no satisfying the kid kinda pissed me off.For someone who thinks everyone else is a phony, he doesn't seem to be much better. He's just a douchebag."
143,Dawa Shingnyer,"Over-rated...was a torture reading the whole thing...hate the protagonist even more than king Joffrey with his terrible catchphrases! Wanted to 'kill him' so that at least the book will end. No plot, no climax."
144,Ali,"I'll be like Good old Holden:it's not like I didn't like it per se, it's just there's not much to it. I Mean you expect it to be something very Classicsh since Mel Gibson kept buying it in the Conspiracy Theory but it was some sort of disappointment, you know what I'm saying ?the writer kept repeating the same stuff over and over to the point where you think he was out of words to write. I somehow enjoyed it but it didn't add much to my library."
145,Anna Cait,I did not enjoy this book at all. The main character was so pessismistic throughout the whole novel. It made me feel so miserable as I read it. I think I may have felt this way because the book was in a teenage boy's perspective. A boy who I was talking to about the book said he loved it and could relate. It does present ideas on the consequences and life lessons learned when one rebels agianst society. This boy spends his entire high school carreer rebeling and finally realizes what really matters at the end of the novel.
146,Jesse Michehl,I came in not wanting to read it cause it was a classic and it was just a stupid book IMHO there was no clear storyline besides the main characters flashback and the cussing got old after the first chapter so overall is was a pretty dumb book 
147,Chad Paradis,In my opinion it was a horrible book about a confused kid that accomplishes nothing at all. He needs the guidence of everyone to stay on track and needed to get a grip on what he was doing and grow up.
148,Faye,Holden is one of my least favorite characters. He hates almost everyone. I don't really identify with him at all. 
149,Gabriela,Having read this book I didn't like and really didn't understand the whole ideal about the book was trying to get across. Having to read this was a dragged for me and thought that I would never finish. Just overall I hated this book.
150,Chippy *Moves Like Jagger* Marco,"Someone reminded me about this book, so I'll do a review:1 Boring2 Couldn't finish it3 Couldn't relate to the character4 Not for me5 Wasted my money buying itThe End."
151,Marissa," I read this for school in high school, and I didn't dislike because of that. I disliked it because I felt the story lacked any real reason to read it. I don't regret reading it, however I,do not understand why a story about a Whitney,teenager,became such a classic."
152,Ashley Ho,"I failed to find plot, conflict, or anything that drew my interest in this book :( I read it as a summer assignment and thank goodness I won't have to read it again."
153,Jamie Griffith,I hate hate hate this book! How it is considered a classic I will never know. The characters are annoying and the plot isn't that great either.
154,Ryan,"On my ""I had to read this for school and hated it and now I want to read it for pleasure and see if I still hate it"" list."
155,Sean Durity,profane and inane. I do not understand why this is called a classic. I will admit that Salinger creates quite a voice for Holden and creates a few moments of pathos. But Holden is so whiny and profane. He really is. ;)
156,Ryan Sigman," The Catcher In The Rye was not a terrible book, but it was not a very good book either. The pros of this book is that this book is very connectable. The main character is named Holden and he is a teenage boy. He deals with a struggle just like most teenagers with school, except he keeps getting kicked out of schools. He also goes through a struggle with his family. The cons of this book is that the characters have a very strange and awkward way of speaking in the book.It is very hard to understand. Secondly the book is boring. This book lacks excitement. There is no plot twist. Lastly the book moves on very slow and is very dragging. It goes over what it needs to for explanation and it made me get confused about the situations in the book. Holden is a similar character to Reese, the main character of a book I am currently reading called Lockdown by Walter Dean Myers. Both Holden and Reese go through the hard struggles that life can be. Reese is in jail and Holden can’t stop getting kicked out of school. Both characters just want to live life and be free so that they can be with their little sisters. Overall I find this book horrible and a big joke. This book is slow, completely unexciting, and just plain pointless in my opinion. But I would recommend this book to people that enjoy reading stories about life and struggle."
157,Iona Sinclair,"HATED IT! I forced my way to the end because I thought it might get better, but it only ever got worse. I hated the narrative, and the main character, and the way everything was 'phoney' ( a horrible American word which I hate ). It took me ages to read and I ended up wishing I hadn't bothered."
158,Jeff Walden,"The story of a haughty, aimless, irresponsible teenager wandering around for a couple days, doing nothing of importance: thoroughly uninteresting. I don't see why people like this book -- it's just ""Hey, look at the antics of this stupid kid!"" I suppose the traditional answer is that it reminds many people of themselves (it didn't for me -- I was always quite down to earth, perhaps too much sometimes), but what would make such reminiscing about ephemeral, meaningless, and unimportant stupidity enjoyable to someone? I don't get it. Alternately, maybe they empathize with Holden Caulfield, but I could muster up no such empathy when I read this at 16 or 17.This book was obviously successful, so it must have done something for lots of people. It did nothing for me."
159,Leonie,It's bad but I seem to find this a recurring problem when it comes to certain 'classics' at the moment. I just don't get it. What was the point of that whole story? If it can even be called a story. There was no beginning. No middle. No end. All it was about was a stupid 16 year old boy who didnt appreciate what he'd got running around New York after getting kicked out of school. The writing style reminded me too much of a clockwork orange. Heavily disappointed with this! 
160,Herb,"I don't know why this book is supposedly a classic. What a monumental waste of time. I kept forcing myself to plod further and further until I got to the stupid end of the book. I haven't felt this resentful of an author wasting my time since I read The Lord Of The Flies, which used to be my all-time hated book. I have found a new, lower-ranked book now, though.This book is on many lists of books that are banned for various reasons, and perhaps it is banned because of the language or maybe it's because there are a couple of themes and scenes that could be construed as ""adult"" but maybe the reason it's banned is because it is stupid.The language is mild by today's standards (especially if you've ever read any Crichton) and the character only has one phrase he really uses through most of the book. The ""F"" word appears in a scene toward the end, too.I can remember someone suggesting I read this book when I was a teenager, but of course I didn't because I was told to, but when I was that age I was too arrogant to have seen myself in it anyway. Even now, although I could identify with Holden Caulfield somewhat, he was just more of a caricature than a character to me. Besides, nowadays, his teachers would report to his parents that they thought there was something wrong with him years before it ever got to the place it is in this book and if the parents wouldn't do anything then they would turn the case over to the SS or CPS. Either way they would have simply given him a prescription and sent him on his merry way.I would never recommend this book to anybody, especially if I wanted to be their friend anymore and I am glad I got it at the ARC Thrift Store half-price sale and only wasted seventy-five cents. It will be good for them, though, since I will be donating it back to them and they can resell it to some other sucker."
161,Kelsey,Holden is a narcissistic brat. The center of his world; spending time doing nothing positive. I wonder if his language abilities were a sign of Tourrette's. 
162,Drew,"I place this in the ""to read"" category as a tongue-in-cheek reference to the fact that I have never, and will never, read this book. The same goes for anything by Bukowski or Kerouac.I'm sure the books are fine, maybe great, but as a rule if I ask a non-reader (that is to say one who only reads what is assigned in class or what is fashionable at their age level/in college) what their favorite book is, it will most often fall on one of these books. I therefore find these books to be ""untouchables"", to borrow from the Indian caste system."
163,beatnick,This to me is one of the most overrated books of all times. I HATED THIS BOOK. Thank god I read it in a day so it didn't take up to much of my time. I think if I would have read this when I was an angry teenager I could have related to it more. 
164,Evan,"I did not like this book at all. There was no excitement, no climax. Holden was annoying to me because he disliked so many people. The only people he liked were his sister and Jane. I thought that he would reunite with Jane but not at all. They didn't even talk. Because everything was boring or upsetting to Holden, it made me be bored and upset with the book. "
165,Rachel Koch,"I don't understand the reasoning for the hype in this book. Although it was well written with a beautiful language, I just didn't get why it's said that all people must read this book. While some books about people thinking reveal a deeper meaning and insight, I failed to find any insight presented in this novel. Nothing happened, and I felt when I finished, that nothing will ever happen to the main character. No thank you."
166,Julie Wright,I did not enjoy reading this book at all. I can see at the time it was written that it would be great. I guess I am numb to hype
167,Saraha19,annoying 15 yearold
168,Amanda Beecroft,HATE this book. Read it because so many people rave about it and consider it a classic but was thoroughly disappointed.
169,Mackenzie Lane,"Nope.The only good thing I can take away from this novel is knowing I have never, and will never be able to identify with Holden Caulfield. "
170,Kimmah,"Ok, I hope nobody murders me for this. I just didn't like the book at all. I didn't care about or like the characters. I didn't like the writing style. The only thing I can say about this book that I actually enjoyed was the metaphor of the catcher in the rye. I understand why this book has a place amongst the classics, but I wouldn't recommend anyone ever read it. It's a waste of time.Now please don't hate me for not enjoying the book. I know so many people that identify with Holden. I've actually lost a friend over the book. It's just not for me."
171,Will Owen,"I could tell you about how Holden is a whiney little twit, but I am not in the mood. I really am not. You have to be in the mood for these sorts of things."
172,Steph,"Never actually finished reading this book because I wasn't feeling the plot and narration as well. Maybe it was too bad to expect too much from a book known to be such a good read. One day, maybe, I'll be able to finish reading this :)"
173,Negishi,"i cannot wait to read murakami's japanese translation version of the book. oh boy, how i didn't like holden's english. you wouldn't believe it. i really didn't. "
174,Jeannie Brimat,Hated it!
175,Plucino,"""and all""Oh! Genius!"
176,Neil (or bleed),"1.5Well, I first heard The Catcher in the Rye when I was in first year college and my cousin was listening to the song We Didn't Start the Fire since he will use it for a project or a presentation if I'm not mistaken. After that, I've searched what is it and found out that it was a book but I'm not fond of reading novels way back that time so I didn't search what it was all about. I just have the idea that it was a book.Then after a long, long years, I finally read it and boy, was i get disappointed. Boy, was I get annoyed. Holden was annoying as fuck. I tried to understand him and symphatize with him and boy I can't. I don't know but I really can't. I also tried to think deep and dig my emotions about what I learned from this book or what I felt about the characters and the story itself and I think I've got none and none, just a couple of boy-sentences and annoyance, probably. And in this kind of book that seems plotless or doesn't have a compelling plot, I'm rooting from the main character to what will he become or to what I will learn from him or from the story itself or what I will realize after all but yeah, none.Anyway, I liked a particular scene and that includes Phoebe or probably I just like Phoebe thus I liked that particular scene. I enjoyed her character so the 1.5 stars solely goes to her.Goodbye."
177,Jami,"Well I was very interested to read this ""classic"" but every time I picked it up I fell asleep. It doesn't really seem to have a point. "
178,Nargess,کتابی که در سن نامناسب خونده شد....اصلا نتونستم باهاش ارتباط برقرار کنم...واسه دوره نوجونی میتونه عالی باشه!
179,Eddie Snipes,"Pure junk. How this became so critically acclaimed, I have no idea. It's a very short book, but I had to force myself through it. It's about a young man who is getting kicked out of college and looks at life as though everything is wrong with everyone but him. It is filled with profanity and hopeless delusions. The title has nothing to do with the story. It is a partially inaccurate quote from a poem he heard a child quoting as he walked by. You can save yourself the trouble of reading by rubbing sandpaper over your eyelids."
180,Sarah Ryburn,"really didn't care for this when i read it in highschool. time of life issue? thinking, perhaps, its reputation argues for a second reading..."
181,Ltljohn,"Augh - What are people thinking? This was a horrible book. I felt like I was reading some very very bad high school writing project. No story, no point, bad grammar. A total waste of time."
182,Brett Mullane,"Warning: This is not a book about a guy running around in a field of grain all day trying to get better at baseball. Very disappointed.On a serious note, I was enjoying this book up until the point where he was in New York. It was funny seeing how Holden interacted with his school ""friends"" and I let it slide because I thought perhaps it was his current surroundings making him act that way. Unfortunately it wasn't; Holden is beyond a jerk and it scares me to think that people relate to this character and his views. Shut up, Holden."
183,Kymberli,"I guess with this book, you either identify with it, or you don't. I don't. Holden is SO whiney. About everything. He is the definition of emo.There are much better coming of age novels out there."
184,Emerald Lavere,"Forced myself to read the entire book in hopes I would eventually understand what all the hype has been about. Now I'm finished and my opinion is...it's a piece of crap. Ultra annoying, rude, immature protagonist that suffers from depression and internally insults almost every person he encounters or thinks about. Reading this was a miserable experience, but after having it on my ""To Read"" list for ages, at least my curiosity has been satisfied, and I can check it off my list, which is the best I can say about it. "
185,Beguine,"People either love this book or hated it. My god do I hate this book. The protagonist makes me want to smack him upside the head and yell ""how are you moving your legs without a spine!"" It's not even one of those books that I hate but acknoweldge is nevertheless acknowldege deserves the title masterpiece. Even if I attempt to be objective, it seems to me it was merely OK to pretty good at best. That said, lots of people whose taste more generally coincides with my own loved this book, so if by some chance you weren't forced to read this in highschool by all means give it a try. "
186,Jannelle,"Eleventh grade required reading, did not enjoy, teacher discussed it in great detail, my thought was and is 'much ado about nothing'."
187,"Sarah ""Pippy""","I started this but will not finish it, I just could not relate to the main character and found him to be far to self indulgent."
188,Deanna-Ray,"First off i have never ever hated a book before. Last week my teacher handed me this book so i read it. I wish i could undo that this is the WORST book i have ever read, and i will never read it again! If i could give it a zero i would. I wanted to strangle the main character for thinking everyone was either phoney or chessey the world is not that black and white."
189,Kimberley,I borrowed this book from the library and quickly got into the book. However when I got to about half way I just lost interest and the character annoyed me so much. That I just gave up reading this book and moved onto something more inspiring and thought provoking.
190,Miranda,"I don't see why everyone loves this book. It's depressing. The character doesn't grow, the story goes nowhere... maybe I missed the point."
191,Victoria (Victoria's Reading Pantry),"OK. Before I begin this review, allow me to state that I understood the premise of this novel. I know that there is so much more to this book than the plot and characters. In fact, I even wrote a metaphor about it, which is more than I do for other books. ( ironic, as my entire site is a metaphor)""Catcher in the Rye is a placid lake. When you look into it, you see your reflection; beneath the surface there is so much more to be discovered.""Now that I have satisfied the countless CITR fans, I will be brutally honest with you - this novel didn't do much for me. In fact, I can't say as though I really enjoyed it. A part of me, the rebellious side, got a kick out of the fact that I was reading a ""dangerous book"". Catcher in the Rye has been banned from countless schools and libraries across the globe. However, I cannot fathom whether it is because of Holden's profusion of profanity or affinity for a marital occupation, or because this book reaches out and strikes a chord on the heartstrings of lost and confused people everywhere. Essentially, the novel follows a more mature, adult Holden Caufield reflecting about when he was kicked out of school for the final time, and his journey, through New York, home. There isn't much of a plot, yet the reason that this book is so lauded is for the language. Holden's words are off-putting yet relatable. Holden spends the entire novel just trying to get someone to listen to him, a an issue that deeply resonates with young adults. At least, it does for most. I did not find Holden's problems palpable, as I find that those I speak with are interested in what I say, or at least care enough about me to pretend. I know that my words here, though they be eternal, are not widely read, and that does not bother me as much as it might others.That is why I did not enjoy this book as much as thousands of others have. If you are searching for someone to simply take you seriously, you are more likely to revel in this novel than I am. I shall reread it again when I have more experience, but for now I am interested in hearing your thoughts. Join the discussion at http://tabletalk.victoriasreadingpant... "
192,BK Blue,"I read it once, in my early 20s. Perhaps I was too old to ""get it""? Maybe I was just in the wrong place in life? Seriously though, I personally found it to be overrated. Im usually all for some good old rebellion and angst, but I remember not caring much for the character. I just found him to be an annoying and pretentious teenager. Aren't there enough of those in real life? Yes, the world sucks especially when you're a teen dealing with the phonies, and the logic of adults is absurd. It seems like there's no point, in anything.Welcome to the world, Holden. Welcome to the world.Maybe it was just too introspective for me? Nah. This novel just wasn't my cup of tea, I guess. Sorry.Perhaps I will try reading it again one day.Nobody hold your breath."
193,Terri Light,"I know, I know, the whole universe is supposed to love this novel. But I don't and here is my story. I come from a Bible Belt state where, in 1982-85, books were still banned from school libraries and reading lists. Most literary parents just gave their kids the books outside of normal curricula. I, however, missed out on quite a few. By the time 1983 rolled around, I had read Jim Carroll's ""Basketball Diaries,"" and because it was adjacent on the college library bookshelf, Tom Carson's ""Twisted Kicks."" Once you have read these hardcore punk coming-of-age books and poked around into Beat poetry, there is no going back to the age of innocence where this would have mattered to me. "
194,Eliza,"You know everyone loves this book and praises it for it's ""true teenage"" voice but I just honestly could never commiserate with this dumb obnoxious kid who swears too much. I did like his caring for his little sister but I just hate this book. I hope to never be forced to read it again. "
195,Tigger,"I'm going to be honest... I wasn't interested, and I didn't really ""get it"". I suppose I can see the messages - the awkwardness and confusion and difficulty of getting through adolescence in a rough and ever changing world, but I didn't feel it at all. I suspect perhaps that part of the reason I disliked this book so much is I'm just a little too old for it - I had Holden's self loathing world loathing ""it's all phony"" phase in high school, and while I still get that way sometimes, travel and university and cognitive maturity have helped me move past it to a stage where I want to see and achieve more with my life. Now Holden's whininess and banality just frustrate and bore me. Salinger's captured the angst of teenage life perfectly, but I hate that the book never really comes to anything... Holden doesn't get anywhere, and neither does the reader. "
196,Wardenfangirl,"This is one of those books where people will either hate it or love it. Sadly, I was one of those who do not like the book very much..."
197,Nura Al Shaikh,"I will make a Sims character out of Holden, dress him up in a tuxedo, take him to the kitchen for a fulfilling meal, and then kill him off over and over again in the pool while I drink a cup of hot cocoa and munch on some cookies... maybe some madeleines, too."
198,Maria Jaqua,I hated this book. I had to read it for class twice. It is 200+ pages of whining from a upper-middle class white male who flunks school at his parent's expense and bitches about how shitty his life is. 
199,Derek,"I didn't know if you could give a book a 0 star rating. This book was terrible. There is a reason that there is no description of the what the book is about on the back cover or the inside flap, the book is about nothing! It is literally reading the diary of a crazy person. It makes no sense. I can't understand why this is a classic."
200,Alex Martinez,"I have no idea why so many people like this story. It's long, boring, with a terrible plot that goes nowhere."
201,Karina Contreras,I found it extremely painful to try and get through such a ridiculous novel. I feel pure hatred for Holden he had the tendency to curse just about every sentence. There was no significance or lessons learned or even character development. Holden In my opinion believed he knew everything about the world which is that everyone is complete morons. I was utterly disappointed on how much time I wasted reading it.
202,Malloreon,"I don't get why this book is such a big deal? Corny 50s vernacular with lots of goddamn swearing in ever other paragraph God's sake! I realized I can't get into a book where the main character is an awkward loser that is unable to make himself/herself useful! What really floored me was the main character had a melt-down and tried to beat up his room-mate just because his room-mate was having sex with random women! Who the hell does that for Chrissakes? I'm still scratching my head trying to figure out what was the plot or point of this goddamn book! Although a quick read, this book was still a big waste of time. "
203,Aubrey,"I absolutely loathed this book. Whining mewling puking brat of a boy. I have no idea why so many people like this, unless something inside them resonates with this prototype of the angsty emo that has become so prevalent in today's society. Thank you, Salinger, for unleashing something that I hate as much, if not more than Twilight. I didn't think it was possible, but you proved me wrong."
204,Musa,"Книга не дала мне ничего, кроме сплошного негатива. Еще немного, и у меня начался бы нервный тик, хотя я человек спокойный.Хотя, взял для себя цитату Вильгельма Штекеля: ""Признак незрелости человека — то, что он хочет благородно умереть за правое дело, а признак зрелости — то, что он хочет смиренно жить ради правого дела""."
205,Ayca Karain,Waste of time! 
206,William,"I read this book because it is considered a classic. I was greatly dissapointed. I had a hard time getting through it, because I did not like the main character."
207,Emily Loveless,I really did NOT like this book and I cringe when I hear people talk about how much they like it. It's a very over rated book. I had to force myself to finish reading page after page of this boring teenager complain about nothing in particular. 
208,Neşe ," Bunca zaman okumadığım için kendime kızıyordum. Kitap bitti ve birşey kaybetmediğimi anladım. Gerçekten fazla abartılmış bir kitap. Bana kalırsa hayatın acılarından, gerçeklerinden uzak insanlarin ilgisini çekebilir sadece. "
209,Alfred Bates,"Ugh. So boring. I was expecting so much better from Salinger, as the other stuff I'd read was actually pretty good. But this wasn't."
210,Daniel Ware,OVER RATED 
211,The Writing Reader,"I couldn't finish it. The main character drove me insane. He was so frickin stupid and immature and selfish. He just whined all the time and did whatever he wasn't supposed to do, and didn't do whatever he was supposed to do. He spent his money with out care, but then complained for three pages about how little money he had.I get that that's part of the purpose of this book—all his mistakes. But I just couldn't do it. "
212,Beth Peninger,"I loathed this book. And I mean I truly loathed it. I couldn't wait to just be done with this book. I hated everything about it. And when Holden reveals that his favorite book is ""The Great Gatsby"" I knew, in part, why I hated this book. I didn't like ""The Great Gatsby"" either! Ugh. What a horrible, depressing read. Ha. Depressing. Holden kept saying he was depressed about this and that. The reason he was so depressed all the time is because he was self-important, arrogant, ignorant, I could go on and on. I will say that if Salinger was trying to make the reader despise Holden he succeeded. Ugh. What a horrible character! Now listen, I have a teenager and I hang out with teenagers in a variety of settings and Holden takes the cake with teenage ick. Someone called it ""teenage angst"". No it was self-important angst. Holden never allowed his vary rare instances of emoting for someone other than himself to take hold and propel him to be a better person. I have to say it again. I loathed this book. I am so glad to be rid of it. "
213,Mrjeffreymiller,"Maybe I should have read this when I was 15 years old, it might have meant something to me when I was a kid. As it is, this was a painful read. One thing I liked, though it too was a source of irritation, was that the narration was consistent. I also liked his relationship with his sister; kind of interesting. For me this was an empty reading experience and wouldn’t recommend it to my contemporaries. "
214,Roumissette,"not sure what the author tried to accomplish - to me, it read like nothing changed from the begining to the end.The ""hero"" pretty much is the same as when he starts... like having accomplished nothing of his time.it reminded me of Maupassant's book ""L'Education Sentimentale"" a book of 350 pages or more that Maupassant wrote about ""nothing"". That was his goal - a book where nothing ever really happens in it and yet is filled with stories but the hero never EVER accomplishes anything...Well , the Catcher in the Rye is the same thing to me."
215,Andrew Reid,"i'll be honest, it was too explicit for me, and i couldn't identify with holden. but by all means go for it. just take an extra lexapro before you do."
216,Chelsea Liller,"I had to stop reading this book after the first chapter because it could not capture my attention. One day, I hope to start it again and get through the whole thing. "
217,Kate  Van Rompaey,"Stop! I already know what you want to say, ""Kate, you have down voted one of the most timeless classics of all time!!"" And I say to that, ""The moment I understand why this is a classic in the first place is the moment I will rate this higher."" Until that time comes, I'm afraid that this book did absolutely nothing for me. From the overall plot/story it's obvious that this book is meant to display the internal struggles of the human adolescent as they battle the transition into adulthood (how's that for classic writing??). However, I feel that the story consisted of Holden calling everyone a phony or a bastard or things that bored or depressed him (this book bored and depressed me). It seemed to me that there were more complaining than actual story and I just don't think it was very effective for me. Now, I could go off on Holden's absolutely wonderful and inspirational moving narration. I could list all the annoying repetitions of a select vocabulary such as; bastard, phony, damn, adding ""and all"" at the end of practically every single sentence, and syntactic repetitions. I could also complain about how he fails to explain certain things because he's ""not in the mood"" or whatever. But what I really want to hit home is how this character is supposed to relate to the youth that struggle with becoming an adult. So we have a kid that has tons of problems. He's lousy with girls, fails school, drinks and smokes, and lacks a good sense of social skills. Sounds like almost any kid in this time period, or any time period for that matter. (I was able to deduce the time setting because there is mention of an actor named Gary Cooper). But they way he thinks really baffles me. It's like he has nailed the personalities and knows exactly what to expect of certain people, yet he is often surprised by what certain people do. This doesn't surprise me because most teenagers think they know everything. I guess what really baffles me is how he words everything, it's just strange I guess. Many of the other characters were all too similar and honestly it is hard to decipher the difference among all the people. You have tons of people like Stradlater that were ""intellectual"" and ""phony"" and girls like Sally that made a big deal out of the most simplest of things. The only character I think I might have enjoyed was Phoebe. In the end I believe it was Phoebe that was Holden's only ""friend"".......I guess. Most of the characters though were so unmemorable that I don't even remember their names quite honestly. What I really wondered was why Holden was so set on running away and never going home. I understand that many parents are strict (trust me, I would know), but were they extremely strict? If Holden had failed so many times before, what was it about this time that made him feel the way he did the whole time? Maybe it was his last chance? I highly doubt that. It just didn't make sense to me. If you're going to be a rebellious teenager at least explain to me what your parents did or said to you that was so horrible. Even if it wasn't his parents, there was no explain of why, it was simply stated that he never wanted to go home(view spoiler)[One last question that I had thought about. I guess I'll never know the answer to this one but, was Mr Antolini really a creeper? It seems like a pat on the head would be such a harmless gesture, but I would've been very disturbed by it too. (hide spoiler)]Chapter 17 ""I don't even like old cars. I mean they don't even interest me. I'd rather have a dam horse. A horse is at least human, for God's sake. A horse you can at least-"" Just think about that for a minute.....a horse is at least human.....I'll give you five to let that boil over. It killed me, it really did."
218,Katie Lorsch,"I detest this novel. I've read it at least three times, all of which were for school, and I will probably die if I have to read it again. I have analyzed it every which way and understand that this is a coming of age novel for the young chap, but I am disgusted by him and just, all of it. Blech."
219,erinbobarin94,"This book could have been good if 95% of it wasn't Holden complaining about phonies, saying he's depressed and/or lonely, or repeating himself. The point of the story is that Holden is depressed because ever since his younger brother died he's been disillusioned to death and human suffering. However, instead of coming across as a sensitive and endearing person who only wants to take care of people, we see him as a hypocritical and whiny boy who refuses to do anything to help himself get out of his depression. Perhaps I would've liked it if the author had explained his mental breakdown and his rehabilitation afterward. The only passage in the book that I enjoyed reading was the one that explains the title; about how the only thing Holden wish to do with his life is catch kids from falling off a cliff. I'd also be a little bit happier with this book if I felt like my teacher was letting us interpret the book ourselves, instead of telling us his opinions."
220,Agape,"A complete disappointment. Why is this book considered to be a classic anyway?! The whole story is completely pointless. The main character appears to be a dumb and judgmental kid, calling everyone else stupid, while in reality, he's in terrible need of some self-criticism. As for Salinger's writing (oh my!!!), it was a really painful experience!!!!! I just wanted to rip my eyes off every single time he kept using the same annoying ''and all'' phrase in almost every single sentence. In fact, he used it 396 times. Yes, I did a search count. His terrible attempt at swearing resulted in using the word ''goddam'' 245 times!!!!!! Overall, the book is dull, repetitive and completely overrated."
221,Daniel Wright,"I'm just glad it's over. I don't generally give up on books, and had it been any longer I would have done. It is possibly the most irritating book ever written.Fair play to the author though. I've never read anything else by Salinger, but I can only assume that he was a reasonably talented writer. For a good writer to deliberately write so consistently badly for so long must take a special effort of will power. I would certainly not be capable of it. Sir, I salute you.I feel slightly guilty giving something so cleverly constructed only one star. Because clever it most certainly is. Pretty much every single thing for which the narrator criticizes someone else is something of which he is guilty. Holden Caulfield is many things. He is deeply troubled. He has intrinsic psychiatric problems (learning diffculties, depression...) coupled with teenage neurosis that make him utterly unbearable - and indeed no-one does bear him, or succeed in showing him proper sympathy. He deserves the reader's pity far more than dislike.But he is unbelievably annoying."
222,Clinton,"I love classics, but this book was a HUGE dissapointment. It was one of the most boring and pointless books I have ever read."
223,Beatriz Brandão,"The reason I read this book was because it is considered by many a ""classic"", one of those books that everyone must read before they die. At first I felt very conflicted about the book since I already knew someone that had read it and, unlike everyone else I knew, he hated it, he hated the book with every fibre of his being. I started and re-started the book several times before I actually managed to read it in it's entirety.Two friends of mine were reading the book when I finally managed to get past the first 20 pages, both of them loved it, both of them couldn't understand how I didn't see the genius that was Salinger in their eyes. The truth is: I found it boring. Boring and, to this day, months after I closed the book once and for all, I still get angry just thinking about it. Everything about the book angers me, from the way Salinger choses his words to the awful, annoying little hypocrite that Holden is.And the worst part, to me, is that I understand why so many teenagers identify with the book. The sense that they, and only they are doing the right thing, making the right choices because, what's the point of it all? Why should I graduate High School? Why should I work a 9-5 job and be miserable?Salinger, however, does a very poor job of... writing; starting with the lack of a climax going all the way to those annoying repetitive wanna-be catchphrases.The point of all this is basically to say that, if I could give this book a zero out of five, I would."
224,Kaity,I had to read this in the 7th grade and it was honestly the most boring book I've ever read. I hated the plot and the characters seemed boring to me.
225,Carri,"I (finally) read Catcher in the Rye as part of the PopSugar 2015 Reading Challenge, to fulfill the ""book I was supposed to read in school but didn't"" category. Right now I'm thinking 16 year old me had the right idea because I struggled through this and was honestly relieved when I finished.I get that Holden is supposed to be an obnoxious, hypocritical, unreliable narrator. Salinger nailed that part...there was an abundance of teenage angst. That part didn't bother me so much, because I read a lot of YA novels and work with teenagers and can deal with angst. What made this novel unenjoyable for me comes down to two main things. The first was the lack of plot. I kept waiting for something to happen...a twist, a reveal, really anything, but unfortunately was left unsatisfied. The second was the repetitiveness. It annoyed me SO MUCH when Holden would say something and then repeat himself two lines later. It really did. I was annoyed. I understand that Catcher in the Rye is a favorite, life-changing book for many readers. And I can appreciate that...find a book you love and can relate to and get and recommend the heck out of it. But it wasn't for me. I typically read for enjoyment, for an escape, and Catcher in the Rue definitely did not deliver that, so part of my dislike was just personal taste. I think ultimately I was disappointed because this novel has been touted as a must read classic, and honestly, I'm over here wondering why. I was severely underwhelmed and, frankly, am glad I skipped it as a teenager."
226,Bgodfrey34,I don't even know where to begin in describing my dislike of this book. I cannot stand the lead character. I have had to read this book 3 different times for different classed and each time was pure torture.
227,A Book Vacation,"Well... this is going to be a spoiler alert, so if you don't want to ruin the book, don't read this. The entire book, I'm reading this pointless story. I mean, it makes absolutley no sense, and the character just rambles on about really stupid stuff. I couldn't wait to be done, and I just wanted it to be over, so sometimes, I admit it, I skipped paragraphs when it was just mumbo jumbo. And then, on the last page, I realized... wow. I mean, the character is seriously psuchotic throughout, and I kept thinking, 'he should be locked up,' but it didn't cross my mind that he WAS locked up... not until the last page, and it's such a kicker that it actually made me like the book, a whole lot more, whereas before I just couldn't wait to finish it and then burn it in my review. I think I would have liked the book a whole lot more if I had known, but then I have to say that probably isn't true either, because then I would have found it even more pointless. I kept wondering... on the first page he mentions he's close to his brother, nead Hollywood, but then he's suddenly in PA, and Maine, etc... so after I read the first page again, it all made sense. Classic."
228,Chaz,i hated this book. it blows donkey balls.
229,Glori De Leon,"This was a reading requirement for high school and I was honestly pretty excited about it, but everything changed once I began reading it. I could NOT stand this books...or maybe I just couldn't stand Holden. This boy has it better than most people do, yet he acts and complains as if his life is the worst. Talk about ungrateful! It was so hard for me to read this without having to stop after every page and rant to myself, but long story short, his little sister ""saves"" him. That's all I really got from reading this book."
230,Chris Calvert,"This book was absolutely terrible! I just couldn't connect with the character Holden. I can't understand how he can possibly complain about everything in the world, and somehow everyone is fake or a phony! Why doesn't he just finish school, I'm sure he would have a better life if he just finished his education. And, if you liked that girl Holden, why dont you call her already! I would not reccomend this book to anyone what so ever."
231,Neena,"i put this book on my reading list because it is popular and my curiosity as to why, got the better of me. i understand it must be hard to write a good novel and thus, i appreciate the efforts of all authors. i must say however that this book wasn't at all what i expected and i was surprised when i reached the end because i expected so much more. i read somewhere that someone read this book and felt led by it to kill someone, but for me, this was an enormous bore. i like the crafting of Holden as a round character that teens can relate to, but the book as a whole was just complaints and cursing. i don't regret reading it though. my curiosity has been satisfied. "
232,Vanillabeany,"I have had to use this book in class, made me hate it even more. Of course it has a powerful theme, but a great book (or even good) should be enjoyable to read. This is not enjoyable...at all."
233,Estelle Miller,"Hated it. The kids a pouty little punk who thinks everyones a ""phony"", blaming everybody else for his poor grades, aggression, and bad habits. I also feel people read way too deeply into it - finding significance in the insignificant... "
234,Lois Zuger,"-This book's main character calls everyone phonies, but he lies and acts separately from how he feels, and therefore is a phony himself. That makes him a hypocrite.-This book has no plot line, this is typically a requirement for books.-This book has no character development, this is also usually a requirement of books.-This book's title is based off of misinterpreted lyrics, which should make it completely irrelevant, but instead, it's so important that it must be made the title!-This book is not remarkable in any way, except it's incredible consistency in making me want to gouge my eyes out.-This book is well dated and should have been forgotten long ago.Why can't I put zero stars?"
235,Amanda Nicole,"I'm reading this book again because somtimes you just need Holden Caulfield. I mean, who doesn't need Holden Caulfield? Everyone needs Holden Caulfield."
236,Josh Grubbs,I found this book to have a repetitive theme. I had no idea where the story was being told from (the place) and the dialogue was very bland.
237,Matt Stevens,"Easily he worst piece of droning drivel I have ever exposed myself to. If trapped on an island with only this book, at least I'd have some toilet paper....."
238,Marzena,"What will we get when we take away the fame the book is surrounded? Well, a lousy pseudo-story about nothing in particular, taken out of the context and with uninteresting characters. It does have a bit of an atmosphere of The Great Gatsby, especially omnipresent chaos and foreboding of inevitable upcoming catastrophy. I do believe you can make a great litereature lesson based on the book. I do believe it has many ways to interpret. But I will insist that this book is, excuse me now, fucked up.I didn't like it. A bit."
239,Selene,"I had to read this for my english class this year and I feel sad saying that I completely hated this book. It was incredibly boring and stale. I know this is considered an american classic, but in my opinion, it was very slow. Reading this book was more of a chore to me than actual enjoyment."
240,Rebecca,"I know everyone loves this but it just doesn't do it for me. I think Holden is so unsympathetic and whiny. Come on kid, life's a fact, get with it!!"
241,Alexander,"The only positive thing to say of this book is that it's enriched my English vocabulary. That's all. I read about a half of it enjoying an interesting language (not usually found in foreign language school books:)), and the rest just not to give up. Oh, and I wanted to finally get to know what was there so ""classic"" in it. I failed to find anything of the kind. The book is boring, almost plotless, and full of dumb thoughts.One of the worst books I've ever read.P.S. You should watch the South Park episode on this book. They have the thoughts of it very similar to mine."
242,Ahmed,"I have no idea what the book is about. I mean there is no plot nor theme. No lesson, or deep meaning in the book. The language suck so bad, I mean the language isn't literary or poetic. I did not enjoy reading it. I read it all though. After each book I read I have mental picture about it but this book I got nothing, blank, gap, emptiness.If you can see something in the book that I cannot see, please tell me. "
243,Stephanie Stanton,Constant sarcasm and condescending tone got old quickly. Would have thrown in fire had it not been required reading in school.
244,Keisi Mancellari,"This is one of the most annoying books I have ever read in my whole life. All Holden has to say is how everybody is a phony and how depressing everything is. He gets me on my nerves as he calls everyone ""old"" for example: old jane, old sally, old phoebe and also the super repeated phrase no kidding. I also was pretty pissed with him wanting to call ""old jane"" but he never really does."
245,Russell George,"You've probably heard this before, but if you read this book as a teenager, you think it's great. If you read this book as an adult, it's possibly one of the most annoying things you'll ever read. I've done both. When I was 17, Holden Caulfield was an interesting hero. When I was 31, he was an annoying little sh*t. Try the Pepsi challenge to determine whether you have grown-up. "
246,Jordan Neely,"never finished this book. i have tried about 3 times and i just can't find the point in it and i can't get into to it. i give up, so its been ""read""."
247,Realteenreviews,"The Gist:Holden Caulfield is a sixteen-year-old boy who was just kicked out of yet another boarding school, for failing four classes and not applying himself. Deciding he can’t stand to stay at Pencey Prep until the end of the term on Wednesday, Holden leaves the school to roam around New York City for three days. During those three days he crashes around New York City, causing his own inner turmoil, and forcing himself to do more soul searching and serious thinking than partying in the Big Apple.What We Think:Reviewed by Living DestinyThis book was one of those read-in-class-but-not-really-during-class-or-as-a-class novels that we all get saddled with at some point each year. What I’d heard about it was mostly neutral comments from our class. Some people said their parents loved it, some said their parents hated it, everyone said they’d never read it before, and our teacher didn’t really give her opinion. So after reading the first couple of chapters as a class, we were set loose on the world of Holden Caulfield. I would rather have left it at those first few chapters.First, characters. Holden Caulfield was an awful main character. He always complained about how people were phony and fake, and he made all these snide comments about life and society. But in reality, he was a huge phony. He lied all the time, mostly about his name and his age. Also, he would comment on how he hated some aspect of life, like how rich people always seemed snobby, but he was actually rich himself. His hypocrisy was incredibly irritating, and how I managed to make it through the entire book without screaming is a wonder. Then there was the fact that he was a huge scaredy-cat, although he pretended to just be aloof. Throughout the entire book, he talked about his old friend Jane Gallagher. She comes back into his world picture in the beginning of the book, while he’s still at Pencey Prep, and while he looks back at their time spent together fondly, he never talks to her. He considers calling her at least five times, but every time he doesn’t because “you have to be in the mood for those things”. That’s ridiculous, and is just an excuse to not call her because he’s afraid that she’s changed since the last time her saw her. He’s afraid of people changing and betraying him, or becoming fake. He just needs to accept that everyone changes, but that doesn’t mean they won’t still like you. Of course he never sees this, but continues to not call Jane and only like little kids, because they’re still innocent and perfect. Holden was the only character that was in the whole story, which bothered me. I know it’s a story told from his memory, but still. He’s the only consistent character, and smaller, static characters circle around him during the entire book. I only got to know one person throughout the whole book, and since I really didn’t like that one person at all, the book wasn’t exactly enjoyable.Next, plot. I was bored to the point that I wanted to throw the book against the wall. I usually read any assigned chapters in books a day or two before they’re due, but with this book, I put it all off until the very latest I possible could. Which was usually around nine or ten the night before it was due. The only thing that kept me reading was the knowledge that it was a graded assignment. And even knowing that, I read grudgingly. The first chapters were the most interesting, but after he left Pencey Prep to go on a little jaunt around New York City, it got horribly dull. It seemed like he really only did three different things: thought about calling Jane, got drunk, and reflected on his younger brother Allie’s death. And he did this for 214 pages. You can just imagine how repetitive it got after a while. Lucky for you, you only have to imagine, not read all 214 tortuous pages. Also, in the very first page of the book, it tells you where he ends up. It’s like, ‘Hi I’m Holden Caulfield, and I’m in a mental hospital, so now I’m going to tell you part of the glorious story that is how I came to be here.’ So now I know the ending, and there’s absolutely no suspense as to what will happen to Holden, because I know where he ultimately ends up. And it actually was only part of the story. He tells up to a point, and then says he’s not going to tell the rest because he doesn’t “feel like it”. I bet the parts he didn’t tell would have been more interesting than the parts he did tell.This book was on the banned books list for a long time. It was only recently taken off the list, and teaching it in schools still causing controversy in some places. Hearing this before reading it, I admit I got excited. Reading a book that was illegal for however many years? Well, it’s got to be on the banned books list for some reason, and it’s probably a super intense book! Don’t get your hopes up, because I sincerely wish mine hadn’t skyrocketed. Huge let down here. I’m still not sure why it was on that silly list. I’ve heard it was because of language, but the language really isn’t that bad. There are swears, but nothing you wouldn’t hear in any high school in the country. Although I suppose it was extreme for the 40’s. My dad said it was because it incurred teenage rebellion. Hello? Rock music did the same thing in the 50’s and 60’s, but that wasn’t banned now was it? Lame!Overall, this book was just not enjoyable. I dreaded reading it, and it sat in my locker like some evil presence, always threatening my good mood with its foul chapters. My teacher told us that this book was either one that you loved or you hated, and I hated this book so very much. It wasn’t worth reading, and the essay I’m creating from this review is not going to be worth the time it takes to cut out my witty thoughts and add in more conforming, school-worthy lines. Ick.Real Teen Rating~ D-: If you have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to read… "
248,Vesa Lehto,"I frankly did not understand this book. Maybe there is some more subtle and hidden meaning to this all, but to me the main character was boring and his story is boring. I could deal with boredom if I would have gotten some insight from this, but no. Description of boredom is not something I need because I'm pretty familiar with that feeling already. I used to be teenager myself (and still was when reading this) and boredom was strong in me.So you don't know what to do with your life? Great you feel shit. But to me that lone sentiment is not worthy a book."
249,Nicola ,"Why this book is so popular is beyond me. It's dull, and nothing happens. I kept waiting for the story to start but it never did. He has a drink, meets a friend, has a drink meets another friend. He complains he hates people who repeat, then spends the rest of the book repeating himself. He spends a page telling us how well he can handle his drink, then proceeds to stagger around and make drunk phonecalls. He's egotistical, and just spends the whole book putting other people down. Extremely boring, and overrated. "
250,Joshua Benjamin,"Cather in the Rye makes the story of Holden Caulfield's troubles life known to all. The author chooses to tell the story from the point of view of Holden and maintains that throughout the story. Using dialogues and flashbacks, the author accomplishes most of the storytelling. Some of the story is told through the present day thoughts of Holden. "
251,Lua,"Couldn't finish it, I'm baffled at it's popularity. Maybe you have to read it when you're a teenager in order to understand it and tolerate it."
252,Rania,"Seriously disappointing. I read through the first part of the book and got bored and skimmed through to the end. Nothing happens at all, just some kid wandering around from here to there doing nothing in particular and saying damn and lousy waaay too many times. I mean if you were to take out all the damns and lousys, this already short book would be cut in half. I respect your opinion if you like this book or if you think it has cultural significance, but I do not agree with you in the least. "
253,Tenaya,"Bizarre. I can't really believe this was on the must read list. Bizarre is really the only way to describe it. Maybe I missed the point of the book. Is all I got out of it was that there is a smart ass teenager who is seriously depressed and bugged by all people in the world, except for his sister. Did I miss something?"
254,Stephanie Gagnon,I hated this book in high school! I hate teaching this book to high school students! I could never relate to the main character and his poor me attitude.
255,Irene DC,Pues ok.
256,Craig,Read the reviews of others who gave this book one star. I agree with their assessments. How it became so popular is beyond me.
257,Sofia ,"I've never had problems with my book tastes.What I mean is, when I rate a book negatively, I never think, There must be something wrong with me. Sometimes I'll say that in my reviews to emphasize the fact that I'm a black sheep, but I've never actually had problems with it. It's my opinion, my taste. No one else's, mine. You can't change that. This is the first thing I've ever doubted myself when I rated a book.I mean, it's a freaking classic. Everyone says it's a book that teenagers can relate to. Because we're all whiny, bratty adolescents like Holden Caulfield? Do adults actually think teenagers act like this? Do they really?Because I am a teenager and that freaking offends me. And now I am scared that adults actually think teenagers are that shallow. To like this book, you must like Holden Caulfield. I, as you can see, did not. Holden speaks very, very immaturely. He does not sound like an older teenager at all. He sounds like a twelve-year-old. Actually, no. To say that would be offensive to twelve-year-olds. He sounds like...I don't know. See, his voice is so immature and so unrealistic. But then he's cursing and cussing and talking about sex and stuff, and it just throws you off. It's quite unsettling, honestly. But honestly, that might've been overlooked had Holden not been the brattiest person I've ever read about.Look, I like cynical narrators. I like Hayley from The Impossible Knife of Memory (so far, anyway) and I like cynical narrators. I do. So that's not it. What bothered me was how PRIVILEGED HOLDEN WAS and how he simply didn't care. He goes to a good school and he doesn't care. He has parents who work hard and he honestly doesn't care. Instead, he thinks he's so superior, labels people phonies, and tries to pick reasons to hate the world and be all LIFE SUX. EW. IM SO AWESOME. Then there was the plot. Or rather, the lack thereof. See, it is basically Holden randomly roaming about, telling random stories, doing random things, meeting random people. There was no point. There's no climax, there's no conflict. I may sound like a preachy English teacher when I say this, but: every book has these things. Well, every good book that is. Even though this is a bad book, I don't agree with the parents who want to ban it. I don't believe that sort of thing, period. I don't support censorship, and I make no exceptions for this book. I'm not sure if we should have students reading it for school. Probably not the greatest book. But I have never agreed in censorship, and I don't want to ban this book. I wanted to make that perfectly clear.So yeah, I didn't like this book. Yeah, maybe it's a classic. Yeah, I don't relate to Holden Caulfield. But after writing this review, I realize something.I don't care."

That doesn't happen too often when I pick up a book. Maybe it was a literary marvel for the world at the time it was released, but this book did absolutley nothing for me."
266,Marielle Lien,"I might be the only one I know that didn't get this book, which is fine, but I disliked it a lot. "
267,Holly,"This is one of those books that we're all supposed to love because it's a ""classic"" but it is in fact just a sloppy pile of shit. I fucking hate this book. Holden is a twat. "
268,Sarah Fessler," I didn't like Catcher in the Rye at all. Holden is the most cynical andannoying person I know. It doesn't even seem like he has any intelligence level the way he acts. He can't seem to learn from his mistakes, and his mistakes are casued by him wanting to be treated more like an adult, but then decides that its too much for him to take. Holden Caulfield wants to be teated more like an adult but at the same time doesn't want to accept the responsibilites of growing up. This is what angers me, if you can't accept everything about growing up, then you shouldn't try to act an age that you can't physically and mentally handle. Another characteristic that I despise about him is his cynincal attitude towards everything and everyone. He complains about everyone who is a 'phony' when he really is the biggest of them all. On the inside, he judges a person he's talking too and saying how stupid or annoying they are and how he really wishes they weren't with him at that moment, when on the outside he's saying 'Oh how good it is to see you.' In my mind he is the biggest phony of them all. "
269,Joanie,"Overrated, simpering, juvenile tosh. Hold in high esteem by people who are either under-read or under-lived."
270,Cameo MacPherson,"Okay, let me brace myself for the derision that is about to come my way... Right, I'm ready now.I hate The Catcher in the Rye.I've tried to like it.I really have. I understand that it is well-crafted, literate, and deep on oh-so-many levels that I, apparently, do not get. But I still hate it.I want to reach through the pages, smack the main character, and tell him to get over himself. Yes, I am aware of the deep psychological meanings behind the book. The feeling of being alone, the pain of growing up. I understand how Holden isolates himself so that others can't cast him out.But I don't care. I didn't enjoy wallowing in adolescent misery when I was an adolescent. I certainly don't want to waste any time reading about someone else wallowing in it now. I'm sure some people find this novel cathartic, and more power to them. But I prefer stories where something - anything - happens, and The Catcher in the Rye left me waiting...and waiting...and waiting."
271,Christian,I understand that this book was groundbreaking for it's time but it's still a very lousy book in my eyes. Probably more suited for teenagers.
272,Froggy1001,"It was awful. I hated it. Whiney 16 year old who thinks he knows it all, but doesn't. Took me almost 3 weeks to read this small 200 page book. "
273,David Housholder,This book needs to be replaced. Too out of date. Too dark.My suggestion: http://tinyurl.com/3xgbshg
274,Asa,"I didn't like this book at all.can I paraphrase the plot theres a guy named holden,  whatever it was boring, boring the catcher in the ryeBut then again I have never liked any of the books I was forced to read in high school"
275,Devon,"I read this book because it's a classic. Normally, I get on well with classics. I've previously enjoyed books such as Pride and Prejudice, Lord of the Flies, The Picture of Dorian Grey and The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. However, this book simply didn't agree with me. I found Holden to be an irritating little twerp, and his 'adventures' were boring. Frankly the entire thing was insipid. I agree with words many others have used in review of this book: dull, bland, boring. Perhaps it is because I cannot relate in any way to the character, nor have I met any people like Holden, but he doesn't seem realistic to me. Honestly I hope he's not realistic as I wouldn't like to meet someone who thinks or acts like Holden. Because this awful creature is the narrator, I simply couldn't connect with this book at all. "
276,Ash,With every page I felt I was wasting more and more of my life.
277,Pyrogenesis,"After careful thought, I've decided that all this book deserves is a brief warning- do not read this book. You have better things to do."
278,Bookclubmamas,I hated this book. I am glad I didn't have to read it for school. It had tons of swearing and the story was not my cup of tea at all.
279,Stacey Gillespie,"I read this book since my son had to read it for AP English. I found it a depressing book. It is about a boy who is self destructive and thinks about sex a lot. I told my son, who didn't want to read it, to learn from this not to make the same mistakes. If it wasn't for class, I would have advised him not to read it."
280,Derya,"The entirety of this book was an incredible bore. The writing was messy, careless and at times seemed like unnecessary ramblings. The character was extremely difficult to connect with, the execution on the whole was tedious. I had to muster all the patience I had left halfway through just to complete it in hope that the story line would pick up. The main character Holden was about as interesting as a toothpick, had no purpose and was full of dour teenage angst. "
281,Richelle Blankenship,Seemed pointless
282,Lucy," Society tells me that I should've enjoyed 'The Catcher in the Rye'. Before I read it i was under the assumption that 'Catcher in the Rye' was one of those great rare books that are universally loved. And then I read it. As I closed the book, disapointment flooded my face.  Was that it then? I questioned  Some 'great' novel.. The problem with the book was Holden. Holden Caufield, the protagonist, was a huge disapointment. No, on picking the book up, I didn't expect him to a be perfect character. I expected him to have his flaws. I didn't expect a hypocritical, arrogant, annoying, whiny teenager. (view spoiler)[ The reason why no-one listened to Holden throughout the book was because of his negative, unpleasant attitude, I spent the entire book wishing he could turn it around. To be fair to Holden, he did. But he turned it around in the very last few pages.  (hide spoiler)] I wished the plot was a little more than Holden aimlessly wandering around New York for a few days. However, this book is all about how people (the readers) perceive it. You could perceive it like me and think it is a boring book about an annoying teenager or you could perceive it as the most enlightening book of the century. That is why, even though I disliked it, I feel that everyone should give Catcher in the Rye a chance. "
283,Kellie Bryant,Quite possibly the worst book I have ever read. There is no coming of age tale in this story. It is simply a story of a kid that has no common sense and no desire to do anything. He always calls other people phony when he himself is the phony one. And he can't understand that. 
284,RJ (ryan),"This book started out really funny, but wound up being unbelievably annoying I have never read a book where I hated the main character until this one."
285,Ivan,"Valjaju samo poglavlja 22, 23 i 24. Knjiga mi se ne sviđa, ali mislim da bi bilo dobro kada bi ju pročitali svi prvašići srednje škole i kada bi ju shvatili."
286,Youssef Arafat,"I am now beginning to believe that American literature is extraordinarily poor when compared to British or Arabic literature, I mean if you think about it; this is considered a classic!I have to mention that there were good momentarily flashes that I felt connected to Caulfield in his depressive mood swings and probably just the handful of times where ""the catcher in the rye"" was mentioned but other than that, this was booger. I get what Salinger tried to do with all the slangs and simple language and it was NOT a major turn off for me, what really was was that there were no hidden meanings, conflict, or even purpose to the story, or if there were they just flew right over my head."
287,Smith Sarah,It was written for adults not teens. Its also just a whiny brat throwing a fit while living in a world of self importance not shared by anyone else.
288,Aidan,"I would give this book no stars if it was possible. Out of all the books I've ever read, Catcher in the Rye is definitely my most hated. What an incredibly terrible book. It has an inane almost non-existent plot that is not at all entertaining. The main character is a stupid little bitch whom I want to curb stomp on every page. This book has absolutely no redeeming qualities. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this piece of trash that isn't worth the paper it's printed on. Or read it just to see how terrible it is."
289,Chloé,Overrated! Selfish delusions of a teenage boy. Not the grandiose insight into humanity so many people proclaim it promises.
290,Sofia,"I'm literally not going to say anything.I read it in Hebrew for school (it was less horrible then), I read it again for John Green's CrashCourse Literature and I'm never picking it up again."
291,Irina Tan,"boring. and the character is just.... so unlike-able. Tried to like this book because it was a classic and people everywhere were saying it's one of the greatest books ever, but no. I wasted my time reading this. sorry."
292,Stephanie Pavlos,"I really hated Holden Caulfield when I read this in high school- what a pretentious, whiny, pain in the ass. How can I appreciate the meaning or ""point"" of a story if I can't stand the narrator?"
293,Andrew Webb,"I am sure this will mark me as quite unsophisticated, but I could not finish this brief and simple book. I do read some classic/difficult/cerebral/long books as I have documented on this website, but after 150 odd pages of an unpleasant and judgmental protagonist using the offensive and uncreative ""GD"" swear several times a page (several times a paragraph... a couple times in a sentence!) I decided my time would be better spent elsewhere. In fact, almost anywhere else!I remember a scene in which the main character is talking to a girl friend. He makes a silly suggestion that they should run off on a cross country journey. Of course she giggles at his silliness. He yells at her for laughing at him and she cries.At that point I can't remember if he is upset with her for crying, but it would be typical of his self centered manner. I do remember that about that point I gave up hope of obtaining any benefit from completing the book."
294,Niki Harris,"Actually, this one is the worst."
295,Jazmin A,"Sorry, unpopular opinion, but I have NO idea why people like this book. I read this in high school ,at the height of my teen angst, and still I thought the main character was a whiny kid. I can't believe we wasted time reading this and not so many other books (especially underrepresented books by POCs!)"
296,Calsi,"This is the kind of book readers will either love or hate. And it's safe to say, I fall into the latter category. I am quite simply not a fan of this story. We have Holden, a rather uninteresting and boring character who's narrating his teenage life and teen life crisis. If that isn't bad enough, his vocabulary consists of only curse words. He rambles. He's idiotic (what idiot believes he has cancer because of having a sore in his mouth for two weeks). Not to mention extremely bipolar. His mood can shift from happy to depressed to angry in the span of two sentences. I don't see a deeper meaning or any sort of meaning that makes it spectacular or special, unless it happens to be the opposite of everything he does. Either I'm not 'cultured' enough or everyone else who loved this book is just high.Why exactly is this a classic? I can think of other books that are really worthy to be called 'classics' and this is so not one of them. Classics should get readers immersed in the story and leave them with something even after the last page has been turned and the last word has been read. Classics should shake the belief of readers, it should question things we'd normally take for granted, it should blow our goddamn minds. If anything, this book probably killed some brain cells along the way but no explosions.If I hadn't had to finish this for English, I would have dropped it ages ago. "
297,Celina Simon,"i didn't like this book, the main character was so negative and he didnt change at ll through the book."
298,Carey,"When I was in high school, so many celebrity teens said this book changed their lives and was the most amazing book around. Well, years later I finally read it and I wasn't impressed. I felt maybe I missed the great life-changing message...so I read it again. I still don't think it is as amazing as people tout it to be. "
299,Sahar Kharrufa,"Bring and old fashioned. Cant see what the fuss was about. Reminds me of old black and white films were nothing happens,"
300,Osborn Jiang,"This is legitimately one of the worst books I've ever read. I simply don't understand how people can sit through the whiny, irritating, extremely lengthy piece of bullcrap that this book is. I probably fell asleep every 10 pages while forcing myself to read this on the train ride home. The main character is whiny and unlikable, he thinks too highly of himself, and the situations he finds himself in are completely boring. "
301,Vik:arra ,"My friend recommended me this book and after seeing how so many people liked it, I decided to read it.It was definitely not what I had expected.At first I was confused, thinking that I had purchased a faulty copy, but no, it was a normal one.First of all the plot was kind of boring and I didn't like the way the events were described. However, I don't like leaving books unread, so I forced myself to finish it. The ending was okay, not that bad, but still not as good as I thought it would be.Secondly, Holden as a character is portrayed as whiny and hypocritical and I hated him. And don't get me started on the catchphrases! I honestly thought it was a bad copy because those catchphrases were repeated over and over. All in all I was really disappointed and I will most likely never read this book again."
302,Anna,"For the right person- someone who'd take time to look for deeper meaning, this book may be enjoyable. But I hated it. My 9th grade English class was read it, and, to be honest, we never finished. "
303,Briane Pagel,"This book is SO overrated. Pretending to like ""Catcher In The Rye"" is the literary equivalent of saying ""I don't watch TV."" Either you're lying or you're wrong."
304,Cortney,"Just too boring for my life. Can't stand the immaturity of the main character, the repetition. Just couldn't get into it but read it anyway. I think I read less than half when I was in grade 6, and now, as a college student, I'm surprised I got any further. Just not my cup of tea."
305,Makala,"Another classic that I didn't like. This is one of those books that you either really love or hate with a passion, and I hate it. I don't like books where nothing gets done in them, and the language was almost unbearable. But I read it because it's one of my friend's favorite books which just goes to further prove the love/hate thing for this book. It was very similar to ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" which I didn't like either for pretty much the same reason I didn't like this one."
306,Black&white,I probably read this one way too late in life in order to be impressed. None of the writing was impressive and Holden being the portrait of a teenager shouldn’t be a justification of him as a literarily personage not being interesting or worthwhile in any way. The subject shouldn’t be an excuse for nothing interesting being offered here. 
307,Natti Katz,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scR-d...
308,Shanni Marmen,As a 37 year old I Hated Holden... As a teenager I would have loved it. Salinger really captured the essence of how it feels to be a teen and it is still relevant today. I just don't want to read another book like this for a long time. I struggled to read this book because I just wanted to kick Holden's teeth in. 1 star only because I don't want to read another like it soon. 5 stars for the writing and getting into the head of a 16 year old...
309,Abdullah Khasawneh,"Note to self: don't read a book just because it's a ""classic"".Another note to self: I know you won't listen to me. Idiot.I am no literary expert, but I know for sure this novel is lacking in many elements that make up a story; not the least of which is a solid plot. Another thing I hated about it is the generous amount of cursing. Is that dude angry or just used to talking like that?This is a depressing book. It made me laugh at certain points, but it's still going in the garbage."
310,Nikie,Ok if i could i would give this book less than one star. Even writing this just brings back the disapointment i found in this book and to my detriment i can not stop reading a book once i have started even if its horrible. The fact that by many this book is considered a classic makes me nauseous inside. I wish i could begin to say why i did not like it but it would put me in a bad place and i could truly go on forever. Suffice to say I did not like it at all
311,Maya Dellor,I guess this is the anthem book for angst-ridden and entitled young adults but I don't think it adds anything of value to one's psyche. Not sure why it's in the high school reading curriculum for so many of us.
312,Sass,"It is my firm belief that Catcher in the Rye must actually be a brilliant novel. If it weren't so well written, there is no way that I could hate Holden Caufield so damn much."
313,Dani Knight,"i thought this book was awful. it is some whiney teenager who has everything. friends, family, fancy school, no money issues. he something to always whine about. nothing is ever good enough for him."
314,Shealyn,The language is what set me off to begin with and then there wasn't any climax to look forward to. The book was pretty much about a boring teenager who learned little through the duration of the novel. Reading it made me feel depressed and bored.
315,Aasiya Maaviah,Do yourself a favour and don't read it. I have never hated a protagonist this much in any of the books I've read. He's conceited and shallow and self-absorbed and hates everyone around him. It amazes me how someone can be so blind. I really hope no one can relate to this guy. 
316,X,"That was very boring, I didn't like the book at all. The good thing was that the book was short. This boy was sick if you ask me or he needed some attention."
317,Jeff Harris,"THIS BOOK SUCKS!!!The Catcher in the Rye was one of the most boring books have ever read. I beleave the plot sucked and the not so subtle,cry, cry ,and cry some more until they lock you up was very boring and it was way to overused.Holden the main character was very bland, for me he was hypocritical and tried to play himself way to hhigh in life. The ending of the book was the worst though very,very,very anticlimactic.There was some upsides of the book though the part with sunny and her pimp was pretty funny,i beleave if they made the book more about Holden becoming a sex crazed pimp it would have been much better of a book. Holden was also just a nice guy you cant really hate him even though hes also bland as stale rye bread. HAH! get it RYE bread. no but Holden is relatable in some ways to some people witch is whats good about this book.If i would recommend this book to anyone really it would be to people who are lost and really dont know how to grow up a lot like Holden himself i guess"
318,bct8728,"This book should have been a short story which just the one chapter in the book that explains the phrase ""catcher in the rye."" The entire book is a bratty teenager wondering around New York, complaining about everything. I completely understand why Salinger wrote the book the way he did, but it doesn't change the fact that 98% of the book was extremely boring and and main character Holden was down right annoying. It really is such a shame because I love the idea of this book and I can really relate to the theme of being unsatisfied and frustrated with the cruel, adult world."
319,Helen,"Wow. Why is this book a classic? I wanted to stop halfway through, but since everyone else in the world has read it, I felt I owed myself that. Didn't get any better though."
320,Jennifer Greenman,"I can find nothing redeeming about this book. Every thought he has has curse words, nothing happens"
321,Anna Lembke," I'm quite illiterate, but I read a lot.""   I wish I was illiterate so I didn't have to read this crap.Now, I agree with John Green on most things in general, but on almost all of his literary views, so when he declared  The Catcher in the Rye his favorite book of all times I knew I had to get it. Mr. Green stated in his video about this book that Holden was neither the person you want to be or be with, but a person that you can associate yourself with. If anyone says that I remind them-even in the slightest way-of Holden Caulfield I have failed.  The book in a sentence: I'm Holden Caulfield and I think you're a phony and this is a terrible book about how sad I am about the death of my brother, but all of you pretentious people have to find god dam deeper meaning in this or you're a phony."" Holden is in one word despicable. In two words he is a major ass (to be poetic). How is it even possible to write a book about someone that is so unlikable. I get it, his brother died and he is sad, but the fact of the matter is that some people are just jerks. That's all there is to it. Holden would be a jerk if he had the prettiest wife ever, and five houses, and his brother back. Things I was tired of by the end of the book -The word phony-God damn -The phrase ""it kills me"" (DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT KILLS ME? STUPID PEOPLE. WHICH IS WHAT YOU ARE)-Angst -Holden Caulfield It wasn't just the characters that got to me, it was the way this book was written.   If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was born, and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all that before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like goimg into it if you want to know the truth.  A thing that is nice about classics-even the terrible ones- is that they use pretty words and nice sentences. This book fails to meet that criteria. All in all, there is nothing positive to say about any aspect of this book."
322,Rudra,"Lousy, phony, yellow book."
323,Zach Doarn," The plain and simple truth is this book was boring as can be, therefore i don't feel like writing an analytical review since it took every ounce of willpower to finish this, so the long of the short? this book sucks "
324,Crista,"This book is just dribble about a kid trying to drink himself through a few days. Half the time the sentence start and finish with the same set of words. Everything makes him depressed, or 'kills me' and if I hear 'and all' one more time!!!"
325,Libbie,"The catcher in the Rye, by J.D. Salinger, is about a teenager named Holden Caulfeild, who goes to an all boys school called Pencey Prep. In this book Holden tells his struggles about responsibility and growing up and finding direction in life. One strength that this book had is that the author's writing style was very easy to understand. Some weaknesses of this book are that the plot of this book is not engaging because of how slow the story is and because of how many ""rabbit trails"" the main character goes on when speaking. I would not rekamend this book because I did not enjoy reading it at all... I thought that the book was very boring, pointless, and didn't have a well thought out plot."
326,Nichole Dicharry,I really did not see the appeal that everyone else saw in this novel.... very dissapointed
327,Daryl Mitz,I only read like five chapters because I really can't get myself to finish this book. I kept falling asleep while reading because I was extremely bored. The main character just keeps on complaining about a lot of stuff which made me decide that the story is pointless and I no longer wanted to finish reading.
328,Louis Bouchard,"This ""modern classic"" was a complete disappointment.The main character is shallow, unlikable, and unbelievable. The story is simplistic and pointless on the surface. One could find deeper meanings in the story only because it's vague. It lacks the elegance of a well crafted allegory, which is what I was hoping for."
329,Mackenzie,"No offense to people who like this book, but I just couldn't finish it. I was not interested at all; I didn't care one bit what happened to Holden. I was put off by the tone/style. I appreciate the writing, but I just couldn't handle the repetition and everything, and Holden's incredibly off-putting, in my opinion.Basically I just don't get the hype. Yes, it may have been ""edgy"" in 1951, but now it just reads like the self-centered, somewhat sociopathic ramblings of an entitled adolescent. I didn't see anything edgy about it now.In short, I just couldn't make myself keep reading when I know there are so many other books out there to read. ( I made it around 2/3 of the way through, for the record.)"
330,Nikki Golden,"I HATED this book with a passion. I know this is supposed to be the greatest coming-of-age book of all time and how many lives it's supposedly changed, but to me, Holden Caulfield was a whiny little bitch who needed to get a life and get over himself. I was so sick of his complaining each and every time he went somewhere else. Stop going out, then! Seriously, I had a hard time finishing it and an even harder time still talking to the people in my life who always raved about it."
331,LouD,"I have yet to read ""an American classic"" that I like. For me this book should have been called: Catch me from falling out of the chair because I will fall asleep reading it. I even googled it and researched it to see if I am missing something. Its just the ramblings of a teenage boy in a manic phase of ""teenagerness"" ! Sure he was a rebel, disenfranchised, lonely, in trouble: what teenager isn't. I am sure that this book caused quite a stir in 1951 when it came out. People just didn't discuss things such as perverts, the sex and such. And I am sure the language was shocking as well. Today we are so warped that it really wasn't shocking and was flat out boring. No epiphanies, revelations or Oprah's A..HA moments. Plus, he bad mouthed Dickens who is one of my favorite authors. I guess it makes sense that if you like Dickens you won't like this book and vice versa. I will gladly take classic British literature: Dickens, Henry James, Oscar Wilde, etc. over American Lit any day! I am dreading the next two books as well. I need to add that I probably would not use this book in any class unless I had to. I think my serious dislike of it would come through in all lectures. I think it could be relevant to teenagers in terms of the themes of isolation, loneliness, mistakes made, being a screw up. I feel there are many more interesting books out there that have those themes. "
332,Jo Dugan,I'm guessing this is the type of book you either love or hate. I wanted to love it and feel so disappointed that it did absolutely nothing for me.
333,Melissa Martin,"No, just no. I didn't like it! "
334,Aaron Banuelos,Over rated. Book sold thousands of copies and now I know it was just because of the school curriculum . Teachers don't know how to be original. This book didn't teach you anything valuable. The character thankfully was fictional or else I woulda choked him out my self. If tupac shakur is the realist then Holden is the phoniest 
335,Brittney Fischer,I read this a while ago and didn't think it was that great. I picked it up because I thought it was one of those books that everyone should read in their lifetime. Now I can say I've read it. That's about it.
336,Belle,"One of those books touted as a 'must read' but i found it outdated and overrated. The protagonist was supposed to come across as a rebel, and was probably seen as such in the 1950's when it was written but these days he'd make the Jonas Brothers look tough by comparison. "
337,WhizKid,"I thought I could empathize with Holden at the time I was reading it, but I later realized so did everyone else around my age.I tried to find out why...swearing, depressing,self-centered(although u can't help not to be at young age)perspective, accusations, and some true-revoking statements about self-identity attract teenagers for sure.I dislike this book since a while ago, when I saw this movie(that I can't recall) that reminded me a lot about this book.Holden is all about himself and his emotions."
338,Bella,"This is a classic American novel which I found to be rather annoying because of the jargon and slang used in the text.It was a book reccommended to me by a friend, and I did like the narrative but the language is what made me dislike it the most."
339,Crazydaisyliz,I remember reading this in either junior high or high school- I don't remember which- and I remember being completely engrossed in the book. And I HATED it!! But I couldn't put it down there was just something about it that kept me hooked- and it wasn't the required book report because I finished it in a day where the rest of my class took about a month to read it. I haven't read it since and really don't plan to but there was just something that I still can't put my finger on....
340,Sydney,"I really didn't like this book.Look at what he's doing with his life! It's frustrating to me that he's drunk pretty much the entire book, and honestly he's lost, and he dragged me down with him... really didn't like this at all. "
341,Mehribaaan,"мне стыдно, но увы. "
342,John,"The story's dull, the prose is simplistic, the protagonist is obnoxious, and it's pretty pointless overall. Why is this a classic again?"
343,Tiara,"This book was a challenge. I don't like it. I know it is purposely written this way, but I hated Holden and his way of telling the story. In my opinion, this book doesn't deserve a 'classic' stutus. I just don't get it. I had A LOT problems with it, but I kept on reading just to see if it would get any better. It was definitely not my 'cup of tea' and I can say that I truly don't like it. 'The Catcher in the Rye' was a disappointment for me, a real one."
344,Devin,"Ugh, teen angst is no more interesting in the 1950's than it is now, especially affluent teen angst. Seriously, how did this book ever become a classic. Whinny, very whinny."
345,Lianne,"This is one of the classics that I really did not enjoy, at all. I read it in high school and have tried to read it again as an adult with the same result. I know many people do love it, but it's just not for me."
346,Risa,I'm often convinced that you have to be a middle-class white American boy to understand this book. Anyone outside this persuasion seems to share my lack of enthusiasm for Salinger.
347,Michi,"I don't understand why this book has such a cult following, I really, really don't. Sure, it’s well written, the protagonist feels like a real person and the plot, despite not really having an obvious point at all, isn’t uninteresting. From what I had heard, though, Salinger intended his protagonist to be identified with. If that's the case, I definitely did not notice! Holden was simply obnoxious: An immature, arrogant little snot who thinks he is the only person in the world who has it all figured out while all other people are “phonies” or dumber than he is. Ugh, the superiority complex on that guy! Rarely have I seen such an unlikeable character who wasn't explicitly meant to be unlikeable. "
348,Steve Ririe,"I didn't get it. So to me, every page of this book was cloth cut from the emperor's new clothes. I can only imagine that those who read this book feel pressure to say they liked it. If you really liked this book you should read Confederacy of Dunces. Same type of book. Much better written. My opinion. "
349,K,I didn't get it. Thank goodness it's a quick read. What's all the hype? Maybe because I'm not a 16 year old prep school NY brat who is wracked with angst? Oh well...
350,Axel Wilson Nydén,"Frankly, my opinion is that The Catcher in the Rye is severely over-rated. I did not like it at all! Possibly this was because it was an English assignment in a period of high school when I was swamped with work ... Maybe I should give it a reread sometime."
351,Moriah,"I always feel putting a book on my for-school shelf discredits the read in some way because I did not read it of my own accord. This one I did. As usual I am uncomfortable hating classics, sure it is because I am missing something but I did not enjoy this book at all. If Holden repeated everything he said only once then the book might be 10 pages shorter, if he got rid of half of his repeats the book might be cut down by 1/3. Don't hold me to that math, they are tired guesstimates of a math enemy.I enjoy that guesstimates is an actual word. In some respects I think like Holden in my tangents as seen above but in other respects I can't see someone really thinking the way Holden does in all his repetitiousness. Truthfully I kept on thinking towards the end that we would find out he had some mild mental condition, but that is probably my ignorance talking, although when I think about it perhaps I might have been subconsciously reminded of my uncle, who repeats himself a lot. Either way I make no claim.I will never look at the word phony the same way again. I am reminded (in Holden style tangents) of when I was little and a table was described as rude in a book I was reading. I was at a YMCA camp and one of the younger staff members looked at what I was reading and asked how a table could be rude. Not knowing but, thinking I did, I explained how if something is rude they are ugly and abrupt and so if a table is rude it does not look pretty. I wasn't to far off until I decided if table could be rude it could be angry and for the next year angry tables and chairs kept popping up in my writing. Phony has developed its own self, much like the table was angry, although it was more elegantly done. Just about the only thing in the story that was elegant. The book had a strong voice, it just happened to be one that made me want to grab the duct tape. I did enjoy the writing style for about the first page before it annoyed me. And yes I am aware my writing is tending towards Salinger's style, it has that tendency whenever I read a book then try to write directly after.I was very disappointed by the ending and I had to re-read the beginning paragraph to realize the book was never going to lead up to a climax, which is what I was expecting. My favorite thing was the short speech about how boring people must all be good whistlers. ""That killed me."" "
352,Chris,"Is it genuinely possible to enjoy such anger? If your friend was like Holden, would you enjoy it? Arguably the worst book I have read, if not the worst book ever written."
353,Brandi,"I was surprised that this book wasn't better, being a classic and all. I just didn't get it... I wouldn't recommend it!"
354,Shania Tasker,"Oh my gosh I am so happy that is over. If I didn't have to read this for school, I would have DNF'd this book at 1%. This was just absolutely tragic. Just to put it out there - this isn't a romance novel (obviously!) so I was set up for a loss when I started reading it. And yes I know, how narrow minded of me to only enjoy one genre, but hey, it is what it is and I love it and it isn't changing any time soon :)Another thing I found annoying about this book was the way Holden un-needingly (is that a word?) repeated himself so many times! 
'She can be very snotty sometimes. She can be quite snotty.'

'I flunked Oral Expression, though. They had this course you had to take, Oral Expression. That I flunked.'
Argh! Holden Please and Thank You xoxoHowever, I don't at all understand this book so maybe that's why I disliked it so much?"
355,Lindsey,I found the narrator to be completely obnoxious and the plot to be non-existent. I don't understand why this book is so famous. 
356,Bailey," The only thing I liked about that book is that it made me seem like the world's most grateful, wonderful, polite, perfect teenager. Ha!"
357,Loretta,"I wanted to punch the main character in the face after the first chapter. Maybe he had a mental disorder, maybe ADD, depression, or he's just a jerk. I just couldn't relate to him. "
358,Jane Cosford,"Maybe it's because I'm not a teenage boy or even a teenager, not even close, but reading this book was a total disappointment. No more than that it was down right irritating or was that just Holden? What a pain in the ass that kid was. The author creates the character of the teenager with great skill but did he have to be such a jerk, I tried to be sensitive to his challenges and his age but still he got even more annoying. Would have given up earlier if it was a book club book and probably should have."
359,Latisha Fonseca,"Finally! I thought this book would never end. I still don't get why this book is a classic. I don't get why it's so heralded. Guess I'm just out of touch with 15-year-old boys. IDK. I'll be honest, I think I might have enjoyed the story if he hadn't called everyone ""old-..."", hadn't spoken in run-on or fragmented sentences, hadn't had such poor grammar and hadn't jumped trains of thought every other paragraph. But that's just me."
360,Melissa Dally,"This seems to be a massive catalog of all the things Holden Caufield dislikes about all the people he knows, except maybe his little sister. I don't know if the author intended for him to have such a limited vocabulary, but nearly everyone is phony and nearly everything was crumby. Crumby to the point that I was starting to picture it raining cookies on some of the scenes. It's not one I'd read again."
361,Karel,It's my fault that I can't stand this: I don't like whining (unless from me) and I don't like teenagers (especially when I was one).
362,Clyguy,"this is possible the worst book i have ever read. Normaly when people write there is a plot, climax, and a point. If nothing else than at least something entertaining, this book failed at all of these. I have read other calssics and like many of them but nothing prepared me for this atrocity of rhetoric."
363,Karen,Reading this book was like spending a couple of hours with someone I don't particularly like. It is a few hours of my life I will never get back. Holden is such a jackass.
364,Doug,"Overrated. Holden Caulfield is just annoying. If I wanted to listen to some brat whine for hours, I could go to McDonalds."
365,Steve Dunn,I still can't believe the number of people who think this is the best book ever.. depressing over hyped usa of a drivel.. don't waste your lives people!!
366,Cameron Osman,If I could give this book a point five star I would. Thee thing I hated most about this book was that there was no plot or climax to the book and it was not captivating what so ever. If a book does not make you want to keep turning page after page of the book then it is not even worth the time of day or even reading the back summary of the book. I would never ever ever recommend this book to anyone I know and actually want the government to go around and collect all these books and burn them. 
367,Cassie,"For all the attention this book has received, I just don't get it. As I recall, this was the only book written by an other wise unknown author. Autobiographical?"
368,Erin Beck,In high school my father told me I'd appreciate this book more If I read it in a few years. I waited untill I was 24 and felt like I had totally outgrown the teen angst centered story.
369,nikki,"I honestly had to force myself to finish this. I found the writing no-where near insightful or inspiring. Just repetitive and mostly annoying. How this book came to be known as ""profound and influential"" is beyond me. Just my honest opinion."
370,W.T. Shad,"Existential teenage angst from a candy ass whelp who's largest problem in life is graffiti. Why, good god why, does anyone enjoy this book? Its no wonder the man who shot John Lennon was carrying a story about nothing in his pocket.The man who shot the man who shot John Lennon was carrying Hemingway, and god bless him for reading stories that build a hero in us all, instead of whining nincompoops."
371,Karissa Buckner,"I have read this book multiple times and have no idea why it's on our summer reading lists. Time better spent any other way than following the misadventures of a moaning, psychotic brat of a teenager. "
372,Saurabh,Story of a spoiled youngster and what does he thinks about the world (Mostly Negative) and how does he pass time after kicked out from school before going home. I did not understand why this book is so popular when all what the boy does in this book is to criticize and hate everyone in the world and calling everyone phoney etc throughout...
373,Amy-Karen,"Truly one of the worst books I have ever read about one of the most selfish, miserable protagonists I have ever encountered..."
374,Hillari,"A classic that I forced myself to read and finish out of principle but there was virtually never a spot that I didn't want to just put the book back on the shelf. I finished it and can boast that accomplishment, but I can't say much more."
375,C.,"I guess you have to have a taste for the language used here ~ which I would describe as somewhat foul and unimaginative. Personally somewhat disappointing, given all the hype around this work. "
376,Waters,"This book wasn't for me. Maybe it's because I am too young for this book, or maybe it's just a disinterest. I don't know, maybe when I am older I will read it again and find it good. But now at 13, I wouldn't recommend it. It's just not for me....yet."
377,Launi,This book somewhat annoyed me because it's narrated by a teenage boy. So there's a lot of slang in it but I didn't mind the ending. Probably not a book I would read again though or even recommend.
378,Jennifer Petersen,I did not get this book at all. It's a classic so I thought I should read it but... I'm speechless. I don't know what to say about it.
379,Roya,DNF at p. 48.This never happened.It's official. My taste has changed.
380,Andreas Mccolley,"Do you know the feeling of alienation? Do you know how the feeling of rejection feels like? Holden Caulfield knows this feeling like the back of his hand. In the novel ""The Catcher in the Rye"" by J.D. Salinger, a very depressed 16 year old, named Holden, gets kicked out of Pencey Prep for not applying himself in anything. Three days before he was suppose to leave his school (after being kicked out), he goes to New York looking to have some fun. He doesn't feel accepted by anybody. He ends up falling into a deep depression full of alcohol and cigarettes based on his failure to connect with people. Another main reason of his depression is that he still mourns the loss of his little brother Allie. He visits many comrades through out the story, hoping to get some help. In the beginning of the book, Holden is at the top of a hill watching over the football game at Pencey Prep. Like most of the book, he is wondering why he is alone and is criticizing everyone for being phony. He goes back to his room and introduces two of the people he shares his room with; Stradlater and Ackley. He does not like either one. On that night, Stradlater goes on a date with Jane Gallagher, which is the girl that Holden was fond of. Holden speaks about that date through out the whole book and he dislikes the idea of him giving Jane ""the time"". After leaving Pencey Prep, Holden checks into a hotel in New York. He gets to his room and he doesn't feel like sleeping. In an attempt to feel better about himself. He goes to the Lavender Room (lounge) in the hotel. He meets 3 women, dances, and gets stuck with the check, and then leaves. Unsatisfied with his night, Holden heads to a nightclub and sits down with coke and some scotch. He see's his brothers ex girlfriend and she ask's him how he is, and then we find out his older brother is in Hollywood. After they say goodbye, he heads back to the hotel. Holden skips a cab and walks 49 blocks home in very harsh weather with no winter jacket, just a red hunting had with flaps. He gets back to his hotel and at the elevator Maurice asks him if he is interested in hiring a prostitute. He accepts without thinking. He then goes to his room to fix himself up. Sunny (the prostitute) goes up to his room and knocks on his door. After Sunny undresses and offer him some fun, Holden decides he does not want to accept her business because. He makes up an excuse by saying he had recent surgery on his back. He tells the reader that he ""did not feel sexy"". He still offers Sunny the $5 bucks for her work.The rest of the book continues with a similar pattern. Almost every scene in the book is of him trying to make a connection with people and failing. The reader finds out that Holden wrote this from a resting home because he got Tuberculosis. He plans on going back to college and to apply himself this time. I think an important quote in the story is in Chapter 25 (towards the end), when Holden is watching Phoebe ride the carousel and Phoebe is about to fall off her horse because she is reaching for a gold ring that gives the winner a free ride. He then says, ""The thing with kids is, if they want to grab for the gold ring, you have to let them do it, and not say anything. If they fall off, they fall off, but it's bad if you say anything to them."" This is the ""climax"" of the story, Holden realizes that he will never live in his Utopian dream he had where children never reach the stage of ""phoniness"" in their adulthood. He also realizes that children must grow up and move on, this shows that he has grown emotionally in the story.In the end, we see that ""The Catcher in the Rye"" can be interpreted in many ways. My idea of the moral of the story is that, if you do not apply yourself in life, you will never go anywhere. I honestly would not recommend this book. I had a rough time not getting bored while reading. I would recommend it to you if you are into sad, realistic and elaborate stories. "
381,Daniela Dileo,"Had to stop reading it, I had read more than half of the book, I'd say 65% and nothing ever happened."
382,Lafcadio,"I thought the protagonist was far whinier than he needed to be. I am interested to read it again after having seen Six Degrees of Separation starring Stockard Channing, Donald Sutherland, Will Smith, and Anthony Michael Hall. Highly recommend the movie, not so much the book that is mentioned in passing in the movie."
383,Caroline Rose,"I know it's a classic, and a high school english teacher could probably extract layers and layers of meaning from it, but come on... it's not a fun read. I'm all for character development & gaining an insight into people's lives, but I could have done without reading this one."
384,Kandice Newren,"I decided to read Catcher in the Rye for Banned Books Week. At first I was intrigued by it b/c it was referenced in a movie (Conspiracy Theories), so I wanted to know what it was all about. About halfway through I was annoyed by the incessant whining, exaggerations, and swearing. To be fair, it's pretty on par with teenagers, at least today. The only part I really liked was the last couple of chapters. Now that I've read it, I don't ever have to pick up this book again."
385,Cait,"I did not enjoy this book. It reminded me of a toned down version of American Psycho because the narrator was always so obsessive about stupid little things. At least Patrick Bateman had a clear reason for being that way. He was crazy. Holden is just whiny. I wish there had been at least some character development, but there wasn't. Holden was annoying at the beginning, and he was annoying at the end. I understand that there was irony because Holden kept talking about how much he hates phonies when he is in fact a phony, but I feel that the story would have been much more interesting had he grasped this fact instead of living a lifestyle to which he so strongly objects."
386,Lori Travis,"I attempted to read, and then returned the book to the library. I think I tried about 25 years to late. I was not amused by the punk attitude of the main character."
387,María García,"Sinceramente a mi esta novela no me ha gustado nada en absoluto. Por su buena fama, declarada una de las novelas universales de la literatura americana, tenía ganas de leerla, pero realmente me ha defraudado mucho. No tiene un argumento sólido. Sus personajes carecen de personalidad y fuerza, no se distingue ninguna trama con un mínimo atractivo, no te cautiva como para recomendar su lectura a nadie. No alcanzo a entender que esta sea la obra seleccionada de la literatura americana puesto que su lectura no me incita a conocer a otros escritores de este país. Quizás sean mis dieciséis años los que me impiden disfrutar esta novela... o quizás no. "
388,Rachael,"snooze fest. i put it down after the first page, i'm sorry to offend you if you liked it, but i just... i don't know. it was awful."
389,Nicole Peh,If only I could rate it negative. This book literally wasted my time with Holden being whiny about everything and I do not understand why this book is so highly rated. 
390,Cheryl Jordan,Didn't like
391,Stuart,I just don't get it. Maybe it was too hyped up and my expectations were too high. I just found it a massive bore and failed to see how it was controversial. If I'd got so much praise for such a poor novel I think I would have become a recluse like Salinger did. 
392,Alexandra,"I had to do a lot of research to understand what was going on in this book. I know it's very appreciated, but it just felt like nothing really happened. I wanted to like this book so much but, sadly it was not my cup of tea."
393,Seferina Limones,"Sadly this was another book that I did not enjoy. The author jumped around from one topic to another which made me lose interest quickly. I couldn't even finish the book due to lack on interest, which is pretty bad because I always finish books, just to say that I attempted to give it the benefit of the doubt. "
394,Holly Taylor,"Considering that this is a classic and the amount of positive reviews, i must have missed the mark on this book as only 9 pages in I couldn't stand it. There's no plot, there's no story and there is no point. In one review I read it said ""to love this book you have to identify with caufield"" but what is there to identify with? He is a rude little boy who judges everyone and everything and deems himself better than it all. The only part of this book that I truly understood is his little sister. She told him he didn't like anything. And that is true. All you read in this book is something else he doesn't like, or someone else being phoney. It's not often I hate a book. But this one I do. I truly hate it. And when I run out of room on my bookshelf it will be the first one I get rid of to make room. "
395,Cj,"Why this book is a ""classic"" must read is beyond me. I read it when I was in school, and reread it recently to refresh my memory so that I could help my son since he was reading it in school.Both times I found the writing to be crude, abusive, and shallow and the main character to be as well.The inner angst of a troubled teen who brings his troubles onto himself and feels as if he is perfect is not of any interest to the rest of us.Certainly not myself.Possibly it was the writing style.But personally I found Mr. Salinger's work to be offensive. "
396,Susha,"The Catcher in the Rye has to be one of the most overrated books of all times. Just like this review, the book reads like a never ending rant.My dislike for the protagonist amplified with each passing page, and repetitive usage of old teenage American slang hardly made it any better.As several readers very correctly point out, there is no middle path with this novel. You either relate to Holden Caulfield or you simply despise him. I firmly belong to the latter set. This is one of those books I had to force myself to read through till the end. "
397,Elia,"I hated this book.I know it has a huge fan following and is considered one of the greatest books in American literature etc., but for me it was just a complete waste of time.I read the book for the first time as a teenager, as required reading for my advanced English class. Most of the other teenagers in my class loved it, but I guess you have to be a specific kind of teenager to identify with Holden Caulfield. I found him whiny, annoying and a complete pain in the ass. I spent the entire book wanting to punch him and tell him to get over himself. "
398,Alida,"Detest this little piece of self-absorbed garbage. As an adult reading this you realize how disgusting the protagonist is... then again, the author is not that different."
399,Sharai,"I don't get what the big deal is about this book. I didn't like it at all. This kid whines his way through the whole thing. He thinks he knows so much, but he doesn't know 'jack'. Being a teenager sucks for everyone. It's hard coming into one's own. It's the testosterone or the hormones or whatever - but I was pissed off at the entire world when I was fifteen. Is that what this book was supposed to do? Let everyone know that life sucks for everyone at that age? "
400,Steve Mal,"Listening to Holden Caulfield whine like a snot nosed bitch for 250 pages. I suffered through it in HS and never will do it again. And Mr. Salinger, could you have given people the common courtesy of a hello in your lifetime? No? Well then, I have no use for you at all."
401,Twinkle Monachan,I started to read this book with high expectations but when I read the last page of the book..am dumbstruck such an idiotic climax!!!felt like going and slapping the another!!!I don't hate the book totally!!!Just the climax!!!!
402,Ownthesky,"I hate this book. Teenage angst is really precarious because if not done properly it comes off as smug. This was torturous to read. If you want a coming of age story read ""Looking for Alaska"" by John Green. It wont make you want to die at the end."
403,Christopher Trader,"What a pile of crap. Nothing like reading 200 pages of NOTHING. Let me give you the condensed version.""This one thing happened. Man I hate that. It's so phony. Then something else happened. It killed me. I did such and such like a madman. The end."""
404,Arin,"I couldn't get into this book. The train of thought point of view was rather interesting but it did get a little tiring after a while especially since the protagonist felt like a whiny spoilt brat I felt like throttling. I get that Salinger was probably trying to portray the spirit of the times but I couldn't care for after reading it halfway through. It was just too much for me.I tried picking it up again because I wanted to be fair to it but I just couldn't move beyond the first few pages the second time round. If you want to get to know how life was like during those times, this will give you a rather insightful glimpse if you can get past the insanely irritating kid. "
405,Aria,Awful book. Maybe useful to extend a 14 year old boy's insight about human behavior. But definitely awful for me. Such a waste of time!
406,Matthew Andersen,"I suppose in 1951 this character was a bit shocking. But I had a hard time getting past the adolescent whining personality. Kept waiting for something to CHANGE and knock me sideways and think ""ok, here we go,""...but it never happened.Oh well, there's plenty of characters I enjoy that other folks don't.Maybe I should change my rating. It wasn't bad. But as an American classic that I always felt guilty about not having read??? Ummm...nope."
407,Ellie,"I wish I could give this zero stars. I have never encountered anything so poorly written. This book literally filled me with rage over the disgraceful writing and 1-dimensional characters. If you want a demonstration on how to write like an utter fool, this is the book for you. "
408,Seestars,"I was forced to read this in highschool and hated it. I feel that I need to read it again to give it, and myself, and fair chance. "
409,Courtney,The most overrated book of all time. Boring. Holden is a completely unsympathetic character. I don't get people who say this is their all time favorite.
410,Baharan,"با توجه به امتياز كلي كه كتاب گرفته قطعاً خيلي ها با نظرم مخالفند، ولي فكر ميكنم كتاب هيچ پيامي نداشت، پسري كه دنبال مفهوم زندگيه، شايد اگر هم سن و سال شخصيت داستان بودم و كتاب رو ميخوندم بيشتر درك ميكردم.در عين حال كتاب پر از جمله هاي زيبا هم بود:""آدم تا وقتي كاري رو انجام نداده از كجا ميدونه بعداً چيكار ميخواد بكنه؟""""هيچوقت به هيشكي چيزي نگو. اگه بگي دلت برا همه تنگ ميشه."""
411,Amanda-Lee (StoryWings),"This book was terrible, so boring!For full review:http://storywings.blogspot.com/2010/0..."
412,Denise Wood,"I started reading this book and it was just one of those books. I could not finish reading ,it did not draw mw in enough to interest me. But i will say just because i did not care for does not mean it would not appeal to someone else ."
413,Jeffrey,"The only reason I actually finished this book is because I was hiking for a week and had nothing else to read! Another ""classic"" that I have no clue as to why it would be a classic!"
414,Kimberlee,"I went into this with out knowing much about the book, other than it is a classic. Now I am trying to figure out who determines what makes a book a classic. The book was nuts. It was a new style of writing for me. The protagonist wrote in the first person, his thoughts as the story moved a long. There was a lot of swearing and just immature thinking. The book is about a rebellious teen who is lost. I'm not sure what the intent of the story was, but I didn't like it."
415,Taryn,"Okay, I know that most of the Western world, and certainly most English teachers would disagree with my review of this book... but I just don't get it. Why do we make teenagers all over the country read this book? Does it call them forth? Does it inspire them? Does it have them confront what's possible in the world? NO. It's just a story about a messed-up kid who makes messed-up decisions. Big whoop. "
416,Kathy Hughes,"I get that it's timeless, I get that every teenager goes through this (including me) but I thought this book, like 1984 was seriously overrated, not at all what I was expecting."
417,Kayla Dent,"I was really looking forward to reading this book because everyone always talked about it and for the most part, I heard that people thought it was pretty good. I was extremely disappointed. The story didn't really captivate me as some classics, like The Great Gatsby, did. In short, it's about a whiny teenager who constantly complains about the problems that he creates for himself. Enough said. He makes poor decisions, thinks the people around him are ""phonies"", and complains.I guess I liked the theme of not wanting to grow up, because it's something I feel like most teenagers go thorough. Instead of actually doing something about it though, he just runs away from his problems and constantly tells you how hard his life is.It wasn't as interesting as I thought it would be and I can't stand Holden. I guess it's worth reading just because it's something almost everyone has read but I wouldn't recommend it. There are much better classics out there"
418,Amanda Soares,"I had to read this in high school, I was not impressed. Its just boring. Holden is whiney and annoying. And my teacher kept trying to make me enjoy it by talking about the ""hidden meaning"" in the book. I get it, teenagers are immature and not capable of making decisions, they're over critical of themselves and their peers, and everyone feels like they don't fit in at that age. Just because a book incorporates those elements doesn't make it good. "
419,Ike,"I started this to branch out and reading a couple of so called classics. This has to be the worst fiction I have ever read. I can't believe people consider this a ""classic."" It was said to be a classic coming of age story. All that I saw was a young irresponsible rebelious boy who cursed too much and was too immature to develop any interpersonal relations or draw any knowledge from his experiences. This book has often been found on the bookshelves of serial killers and mass murderers and I am not suprised. The main characters view of society in general is so warped they probably relate to it. "
420,Gabriel,"Same as before, endless monolog by main character drives me insane...almost finished, but realized there was no point."
421,LBSinger,This is one of the worst I have ever read. The speaker was annoying as heck and I wouldn't have finished it if I hadn't had to read it for English.
422,Amelie,"I'll be honest. I hated this book. No. No actually the book was okay ... It's Holden Caulfield I couldn't stand. His attutide, his way of thinking ... I just couldn't stand it. "
423,Andrea Yang," Let's just make this clear: I don't like this book, I don't like Holden, and I don't like Salinger. But re-reading it for school today after two years, I found myself not hating it as much as I used to. The readers of this book are so polarized. Either you love it or you don't. This time I read it almost as a joke, but this way I started to understand this book a little bit more. Whether we like it or not, Holden is just the extreme version of ever human being ever. We have to admit that there are points in our lives, not just when we were teenagers, when we hated the world and the people so much that we just wanted to curse everyone and call on the hypocrites. Holden believed that people are all phonies, but ironically he's nothing less. And that's what we are: We hate hypocrisy but there's a hypocrisy in each one of us because we have to survive in this society. Maybe Salinger chose to write about a 16 year old because like all YA fiction nowadays, teenagers feel the need to think about this world and find out the truth about life and human nature buried way down deep. They aren't afraid to ask questions and point out things that adults cannot say.  So in a way, maybe adults who like this book do because being 'Holden' is something they can never go back to. Some teenagers do because they resonate with things that he feels and believes. And some teenagers(like me) do not because we think we suck it up and live through this 'phase' without being him. But in 20 year's time, maybe I'll look back on my high school days and miss the freedom of hating on and yelling at this big cruel world."
424,Airi ,"I'm about halfway into the book. But don't expect me to deliver a complete review anytime soon. It's just something I read in between classes and on public transportation (and that's if my Zune's out of battery). I'm sorry, I just don't like it much. I find Holden to be an enormous hypocrite. He has basically no friends because he thinks almost everyone to be a jerk and I think that makes him a jerk. I find his repetitiveness to be irritating and his manner of viewing the world depressing. Although, in that respect, I suppose I can relate to him."
425,Sarah Franz,"I had to read this book for an English class in high school. I didn't enjoy it, and not because I had to read it. There didn't seem to be much of a plot. He just kind of randomly wandered around. Supposedly it had a great example of a ""confidant"", but I think that's the only positive literary thing about this book. "
426,Chris Hayman,"Another ugh book. I almost made it to the end but couldn't. I just wanted to shake Holden and say ""snap out of it."" "
427,Kaylin M,I found it really difficult to read this book because I simply could not bring my self to empathize with Holden. I slogged through it just so I could finally say I'd read it.
428,Sonya Huser,"I'm still trying to figure out why this is standard required reading. Holden, Holden, Holden. What a whiny little bitch. He's a privileged, entitled, wimpy, whiny little white boy. What draws educators to this book? What's the point?And what is his thing with the GD ducks all about?Just trying to understand."
429,Tracey,"I can't believe this is on the list as one of the greatest books every written. Holden Caulfield is one of the most annoying characters put on paper! He is a big ""phony""."
430,Colleen," I have always heard of Salinger's genius touted by teachers and writers but never until now read the book. I was the class of 84 so high school reading was mainly Orwell, which after reading Catcher I am thankful. I have never been more disappointed in a book. It did not come close to reaching the hype that proceeds this book.I know, my literary friends will say I don't get it. I don't get a sixteen year old male in the late 40s, maybe 1950, hating his life, fearing his future and worrying himself into madness. Truthfully, from all the hype, I was expecting some Kerouacian equivalent with brash and revolutionary sentiment. What I got was 216 pages of adolescent moaning. He hates everything! He hates phonies, yet he is one. He speaks in redundant phrases, his favorite word is Goddamn, and everyone is 'old' this or 'old' that. And everything makes him sad! Nuns with tattered baskets make him sad. Reading the Catcher in the Rye is like being locking in a room for two days with an obnoxious hormonal teen. Now a Salinger fan would say, ""The Catcher in the Rye"" is not for entertainment, its more thought provoking. The only thought which the book provoked in me was please get to a point, where is all this going except to the inevitable asylum?There was not one moment in the book that I really liked. No, I take that back. Holden liked Thomas Hardy, I love Hardy as well. In fact my favorite book is ""Return of the Native"" which he mentions a few times, and we both like the character Eustacia Vye. I took this bit of commonality and tried to build a bond on that, but I could not. In the end, I could not feel any empathy for Holden. So please tell me what is all the hype about, why do angst-filled teens cling to these pages? Is it just a cult classic? Or is it because the adults of the time banned it from the shelves because of the language? I believe this may be the case. I like to call it the WASP effect.Let me explain the WASP effect, WASP was an 80s hair band who lacked any musical talent, so much so, they were often booed from the stage. However a political group led by Tipper Gore called the PMRC (Parent Music Resource Center) singled out this group as a threat to our teens morality, By the next year, WASP was headlining arena concerts, selling out and still awful. This I believe would explain the notoriety of Catcher in the Rye, there is no other explanation. Sorry to my literary friends who drool over it. The only drool this book produced in me was from boredom. "
431,Cass,"I honestly did not like this book. I had to read it as an assignment in honors freshman year, it was an assignment to find the themes and symbolism in each chapter, and that was frustrating. Having to cut through all the excess words and statements, that meant nothing to the plot, but took up two or three pages, was awful. However, really there was only a few reasons why I didn't really like the plot. If you are an author please do not take this book as an example of your books, do not make the same mistakes. If you are ever going to write a book here are some things you should do differently: 1) Have a likable character.-The book is ten times better if more than 20% of people who read it can connect and like the character. 2) Have some sort of plot.-have a storyline, with a climax that doesn't leave the reader guessing... thats a bit of a reminder your book is a flop 3) Make every word worth it.- Details are wonderful, however, rambling is not. Please detail what is actually important, not some random thought you felt should be included.Overall, this just wasn't the book for me, and looking at reviews it appears that I'm not alone. I understand how some might like it my age (15), but honestly I can't connect with a character that needs a serious attitude adjustment, and to grow up. "
432,Lethasian,"I am twenty-three years old and in less than a month will be twenty-four. The fact that I can easily say I've missed out on nothing by not reading this book up until now is a very bad thing. J.D. Salinger is the epitome of being in the right place at the right time. This book has been around for fifty years. People have praised and banned and loved this book for over fifty years and I can't see it. I just can't. I've come to the conclusion that I would never want to meet the person who identifies with Holden Caulfield. I went through this (less than three hundred page) compact volume in less than an accumulative 24 hours and while I'm not sorry I read it, this book has done nothing but rob me of time that I haven't a clue what I'd done with otherwise. That's the best thing I can say about it. It killed time. So can heroine and that doesn't make it a good thing. I have seen quotes about this book and I've seen the reviews of friends saying what a wonderful book it is. I feel like people call it wonderful because they don't want to be belittled for not enjoying it. It's an inside look of a person you never, ever want to be. Someone told me that you're not meant to like Holden Caulfield. If that's the truly the case, I don't understand the merit it consistently holds. Obviously given the time at which it was written, it was truly only meant for one specific audience and that was the young, white, well-off male. How else can you justify ruining yourself academically and not feeling a thing for it? How can you justify your parents throwing so much money into a ravenous black hole of a person? Now, Holden is not the worst main character I've come across (March, I'm looking at you. I know who you are and the classics you undermine.)I can give it that much. But all the empathy/sympathy I had for the character was in relation to his deceased younger brother. For all I know this was the catalyst of said apathetic-yet-strangely-full-fledged-emotioned existence that made up this pathetic teenager. Perhaps. But it wouldn't surprise me to find that he was always like this and all the death of his brother did was define this deficit of any purported familiarity. I'm sorry, but at the end of the day, Holden Caulfield is the rich kid in school who's totaled every car he's ever owned and sees it replaced in under a week. He's never going to be anything more than a child who thinks he views the world from a man's point of view. His Mommy and Daddy will always take care of him regardless of how he sabotages his own life. In this day and age, he would not be smoking cigarettes and drinking until his liver called uncle.He'd be in rehab, jail, dead or probably on heroine, while Mommy and Daddy unknowingly finance his habit. People --this kid does not have a bad life. No one abuses him but himself and he wants everyone to cry for him and feel his pain. The legitimate pain that you feel for the loss of a sibling? Understandable. Does that explain the completely vacuous sense of self? No. He thinks he's the smartest, realest person in the world and he's twice as vacuous and vapid as those he condemns. He has no grasp on how the world works and he's not supposed to. He's a child. He gets whatever the fuck he wants (forgive me, Mommy didn't buy him the right ice skates for Christmas, pardon me while I cry for you.) and does what he wants and there isn't a person yet who has been able to wrench him out of the this Bush-era (first one) egotism. This is not a role-model. He his not profound. There is nothing profound in this book that belongs to the actual author of this book. Everything profound was taken from somewhere else. Does anyone notice that? This is a kid we all would have hated had we the misfortune to encounter him in our day-to-day life. He needs to get smacked and told to grow the hell up. He's a modern Peter Pan and Neverland will never truly be. I wouldn't have enjoyed this at his age. I don't enjoy it now and having read it, I haven't missed anything by procrastinating until now. I will tell anyone who feels this character resonates with you, that you need some help and you need to think like an adult because this is not the kind of child you want to have. He is bent on causing his own misery and does it beautifully and it's especially sad if your life echoes his because that's all it is. Misery. Self-imposed, self-aggrandizing misery. "
433,Joan,"A whole book full of an arrogant, obnoxious, self-centered insufferable teenage boy, so full of his own self-importance! Glad it's over! "
434,Lulu,"Ugh. I know that this book is a classic, but I really disliked it. I hated the character of Holden, and the plot just went on and on... I just didn't like it at all. Feel free to hate me :-P-Lulu"
435,Sonja,"I apparently need to search for a reading guide for this book because I just did not. get. it. But, it's checked off my list."
436,Adilene,This book was a disappointment. There is no plot what so ever
437,Prince W. Cantodea,"Prometieron que leería el gran clásico de la literatura norteamericana. Pero sólo encontré un montón de hojas decepcionantes, en la actualidad las referencias de Holden Caulfield no simbolizan actitudes rebeldes, quizá en el contexto social de la novela, sabemos que fue escrito a principios de los años cincuenta, y que en esa época existía mucha represión sexual y tabúes, por lo que pudo llegar a escandalizar por la temática. Cierto es que, fuera del contexto social, y en la actualidad no responde a las exigencias del lector moderno, no hay alabanzas ni apologías a la sexualidad, a las drogas o a la prostitución, si bien el relato acierta a presentar una ansiedad y hastío por la vida en plena adolescencia, es algo que me agradó, pues la novela refleja esa extrañeza que sentimos cuando somos adolescentes, desconcierto, una soledad extravagante que se puede apreciar conforme avanza la lectura y conforme pasan las páginas y la historia se percibe la soledad que rodea al personaje, y las desdichas que debe sobrellevar para lograr construir ese vacío en torno suyo. La novela es muy similar al estilo desenfadado y arriesgado de José Agustín, pero sin la narrativa vigorosa del escritor mexicano. La novela me ha decepcionado, aunque rescato algunas cosas: La soledad que se percibe es aterradora, la constante incertidumbre y ese acercamiento al mundo adulto, es lo más llamativo de toda la novela. "
438,Sarah,"A book about a guy who does nothing, for a whole day. I'm told that it's guy book and I just don't get it. Like Hemingway. "
439,Κατερίνα Μαλακατέ,"http://www.diavazontas.blogspot.gr/20... Το πώς το «The catcher in the rye» ξέφυγε από τα εφηβικά μου αναγνώσματα είναι απορίας άξιο, μιας και πήγαινα σε ένα σχολείο που είχε ιδιαίτερη αγάπη στα αγγλικά. Από τη μια, το ότι δεν το διάβασα στα πλαίσια ενός μαθήματος Αμερικάνικης λογοτεχνίας είναι καλό, από την άλλη τα τριανταπέντε είναι η λάθος ηλικία για να το διαβάσει κανείς για πρώτη φορά.Πρωταγωνιστής και αφηγητής ο Holden Caulfield, ένα δεκαεξάχρονο αγόρι που μόλις αποβλήθηκε από ένα ακόμα σχολείο για παιδιά της καλής κοινωνίας. Ο Holden ζει μια διήμερη περιπέτεια στη Νέα Υόρκη, ξοδεύοντας τα λεφτά των γονιών του, όσο «αρνείται» να πάει σπίτι και να αντιμετωπίσει το θυμό τους για την αποβολή. Είναι ένα παιδί που σιχαίνεται τους «δήθεν», που δεν αντέχει τα «πρέπει», που τελικά μέσα σε όλα αυτά είναι τόσο δήθεν και ακολουθεί όλες τις προσταγές της εποχής, όσο και οι υπόλοιποι.Η γλώσσα, που το ’50 που γράφτηκε το βιβλίο μπορεί να θεωρούνταν και αργκό, τώρα είναι κάπως παρωχημένη, η εφηβική «επανάσταση» λήγει σε αδιέξοδο, η «αποστασιοποίηση» από τους γονείς είναι μόνον παροδική. Αυτά και η «γκρίνια» του ήρωα, ενόχλησαν τον τριανταπεντάχρονο εαυτό μου, πιθανολογώ πως ο δεκαεξάχρονος δεν θα τα είχε καν προσέξει. Ο Χόλντεν είναι ένας συμπαθητικός αντιήρωας, ένα παιδί που διαβάζει αν και αρνείται να διαβάσει για το σχολείο, ένας έφηβος που δεν θέλει να χάσει την παρθενιά του από μια πόρνη κι ας του προσφέρεται στο πιάτο, που αγαπάει τα αδέλφια του, που έχει σοβαρά προβλήματα από το θάνατο του μικρού του αδελφού, που ξέρει πως τελικά θα καταλήξει να παραιτηθεί. Καταλαβαίνω γιατί πρόκειται για ένα «κλασικό» βιβλίο εφηβικής διαφορετικότητας, αντιλαμβάνομαι γιατί προκάλεσε στην εποχή του, αλλά για κάποιο λόγο η γοητεία του μου διαφεύγει. Ίσως δεν μπόρεσα να ταυτιστώ με τη «γιαλατζί» επανάσταση, ίσως μου έλειψε το χιούμορ∙ αν ο συγγραφέας και ο ήρωας έπαιρναν λιγότερο στα σοβαρά στον εαυτό τους, θα ταυτιζόμουν περισσότερο. "
440,babyhippoface,Blech. I can hear people curse lots of places. Doesn't impress me. Holden is THE most unlikeable protagonist of all time for me. 
441,Kelly Lyons,"I was curious what this classic was about. Unfortunately, it's lure did not pull me in enough to even finish the book. I rarely not finish something I start, but with the Catcher I decided it wasn't doing it for me at the half way point."
442,Ricardo,10th Graders should read this book because it shows the struggle of a teenager boy trying to find his way into society mentally. In our modern day all teenagers think of themselves as trash and others as trophies. The catcher in the rye shows how Holden can't fit-in in any form. -R.R
443,Darci,This book was so boring. I kept waiting for something to happen but it never did. It apparently was controversial at the time it was published but nothing to it really. 
444,Abby Rhode,"If I could give it a zero I would as this so-called ""masterpiece"" is just plain awful... The metaphors aren't even that interesting or clever. I was bored to tears!!!"
445,Shannon Rodriguez,"I thought this book was pretty terrible, I didn't really get the point. I feel like there was no climax, and I was disappointed nothing happened throughout the story. It literally consists of Holden moping around and drinking. "
446,Nitya Elayath,"It has always been my prerogative to be as objective as possible while reviewing a book and this book has been by far the most difficult test of that. Evidently, I failed. I could not picture this book as anything else but a collection of rantings of a depressed & emotionally unstable mind. I wholeheartedly disagree with the view that this as an example of good reading, unless diaries of psychiatric patients is the genre you are going for. "
447,Stefano,"sono arrivato a metà ma proprio non ce la facevo: le giornate più noiose della storia raccontate dal protagonista peggiore della storia. sarà il romanzo di una generazione, ma è il romanzo di una generazione troppo lontana dalla mia perché me ne possa fregare qualcosa"
448,Eric Wilson,"When my english teacher said we were reading it, I was like'This is a classic, I will probably enjoy this'. I had read Carrie (Steven King) before this, so I thought that Carrie, even if it was an amazing book, wasn't as good as CITR.I don't know what I was thinking: Holden is such a lazy stupid and annoying brat who's so frickin stupid to not know where the birds go in the winter and like c'mon, you're 16 years old Holden!!!He's so depressing, everyone he meets, he ditches them or he gets ditched. The writer was a true queer to make a book like this I'm ashamed to have read such a book"
449,Amy (amyb2332),"I really, really didn't like this book. I'm not even sure why I kept reading it except that I feel like since it is a ""classic"" that I should finish. I thought Holden was really annoying. I'm actually having a hard time figuring out why people like him? I feel like I must have read the wrong book? Or maybe my book was missing pages - you know, the pages where something actually happened except for Holden whining.I'm definitely glad to have finished this one and I'm very thankful I didn't have to read this in High School!"
450,Tom James,"At first, I started off enjoying the writing style and Caulfield's opinions and his way of addressing things, but after about a third of the book, I was starting to get tired of it, and by about Chapter 15, I just wanted it to end. This isn't the worst book I've read, but it certainly isn't one of the best either. It just didn't entertain to me in the slightest, and in my opinion, I don't know how people consider this to be a 'literary classic.'"
451,Flint,"I don't think anyone can argue the social relevance of ""Catcher in the Rye,"" everyone says so. Holden Caulfied is in fact one troubled and screwed up kid. Unfortunately Salinger couldn't encapsulate all this into a viable story worth reading. I wanted to throw this novel in the garbage as I was reading it. The main theme of the book seemed to be one long whine session from beginning to end. Holden complains about everything! That's all you hear page after page after page. It just to be too much. When a book becomes a chore to read whatever significance you are attempting to impart on the reader becomes lost in a sea of frustration and boredom. There still needs to an actual story above all else."
452,Katie Grainger,"I know this is a classic but I just couldn't get on with it, I found it really hard to read and found that I had no sympathy for the character!! "
453,Patti K,"I don't care what other people say, I hated this book. The whole time I was reading it, all I could think was that it was a big sob story, oh, pity me! Annoying. I almost didn't finish it - short book that it is - I hated it that much. But then, I figured, people would say, 'Oh, you should have read the whole thing! Then you'd have liked it!' Nope. Read the whole thing, hated every bit. "
454,Steve ,"The Catcher In The Rye... The classic (so we're told) read given to us in High School... Mmmmm... Okay, let's try to be fair, or at least open to what others may enjoy about this book... First published in serial form in the U.S. 1945-46. First published in book form in the U.S. 1951. We're talking an entirely different era, post war, with societies both struggling and trying to hold on to different and changing ideals. There weren't many authors shaking the trees at the time, not even Hemmingway. And, to be slightly fair, they were not trying to get into the mind of a radically disturbed teenager (trying, or actually avoiding) dealing with the loss of a family member (Caulfield's brother). There weren't many author's (I can't think of one, poets aside), that would dare to print 'Fuck You' in any context, though other authors would touch on going crazy (even Agatha Christie). So, does Salinger capture 'teenage angst'? Yes, he does, quite well even. And onward to deranged.Does he delve into the reactions of the loss of a loved one upon a teenager (sixteen btw.)? In one possible way of over thousands, yes, he does.Does Salinger give you the feeling of isolation that 'many' teenager's experience? In a way, yes. One possible way of thousands of possible responses at least. So, the book was a magnificent breakthrough of it's time? Maybe it was, that is a debate in itself. It caused controversy, was deemed flagrantly subversive and a bad influence. Some literary reviews scathed it. Others gave the society review along the lines: ""Darling, it was magnificent. You captured the raw essensce of a tangled and tortured mind. I simply adored it"".Okay, so what's wrong with it then? (Steve stop smiling *laughing*)Where to start? Mmmmmm...I'm not reviewing it for it's impact in the 40's & 50's, nor even the 60's & 70's. Is it a great story? No. Is it a good story? No. Is it even a gripping read? No. When you get to about page 170 the most interesting dialogue is with his younger sister Phoebe. Caulfield's older brother D.B. (a damn fine writer by all accounts) is mentioned often, but with no appearance and no dialogue. Almost all the dialogue in the book is in the form of Caulfield's thoughts and feelings on his fellow man...And they can be summed up as 'bloody repetitive to the point of annoying and spoiling the prose even further'. They largely consist of virtually 'everyone' being a 'phoney', he hates 'phonies' with a passion, in fact he appears to hate something about everyone (give him a badge). Then later he misses them (Hypocrite). If you don't wish to count the repetitions of 'phoney' (personally I couldn't be arsed), then maybe count all the other repetitions...Using his many other repetitions the following would be Holden Caulfield's review of Salinger's Catcher In The Rye: 'Chrissake, goddamn phoney repeats himself, makes me so depressed. I think I'm going crazy, I really do. It killed me. If you want to know the truth'.Yep, try counting those phrases again and again and again and again... I did love the ending, I really did. It was really short, without any real meaning or conclusion, but it couldn't have come fast enough. It really was a 'goddamn' lovely surprize 'for Chrissake'. 'If you want to know the truth'. The fact that Holden Caulfield claims to be a pacifist and later wishes to kill someone he's never met by smashing his head on the concrete steps is brilliant prose and content. Alright, this guy (or girl) did commit the ultimate sin by writing/carving 'Fuck You' on a school stairwell. He/She must have guessed Holden would be calling ;)If you really want a trip through a self-obsessed teenage boys head whilst he struggles with a grief he's avoiding then read this book. If you love constant repetitions, lack of character dialogue, lack of character depth (aside from Caulfield's thoughts), and don't mind that the book goes absolutely 'nowhere', then this book maybe for you ;)Alternatively, I'd recommend 'Starter For Ten' (deals with teenage troubles and loss of a family member, and has 'other characters' and funny). Or, 'The Curious Incident of The Dog in The Night-time', which shows you the life of a teenager struggling with Asperger's Syndrome. Or, you could read 'goddam' Catcher In The Rye 'for Chrissake' *laughing*...I wondered why I didn't take to this book in High School, I thought it may have been my reluctance to read it. Now I know why I didn't like the book. Though back at High School my English Lit. teacher thought it was 'marvelous darling' ;) Yes, I thought this book was a poor read... Bullshit! I thought it was annoying crap ;)"
455,Adrianne,I read this in high school and wasn't thrilled with it after hearing how great it was. It does have a different style of writing (one of the reasons it was suppose to me so cool) but the teenage boy in it was a whiney turd that said the F word alot. I think I read it because it was in that one movie The Conspirasy Theory. I recommed it to all pretentious philosophy know-it-alls. 
456,Minxy Librarian ,I forced myself to read this book and I am happy to know I didn't miss out on much. It was a quick read but I was bored by it. It kind of dragged on and I get depression but I felt it would have been a better book of him getting out of it and doing something with his life. He annoyed me so much. I was surprised at some of the modern day subjects it had in it and I did like how honest it was. I don't think I will ever read this book again.
457,Jamey,"I listened to this audio book while working. I don't know which I liked less, the book itself, or a Canadian reader reading a kid from New York. The story was just a drawn out tale of a kid who has gotten kicked out of many prep schools in the 50's. Could have been interesting, but really wasn't. I think it was slated for banning when written because of swearing and his thoughts on sex, and I really have to wonder if the fame it garnered for that is what made it famous more than the actual story. "
458,James,"I wish I could give this book zero stars. I know, I know, it's a damn classic. Everyone loves it. It has made countless generations of young, American men feel special, different, and unified in their solitude. Still, I just can't deal with it. I find Holden to be completely uninteresting as a person and totally unredeeming as a character. Bleah."
459,Alice,"So so so boring. Literally nothing happened, regret wasting my life reading this, do not understand the hype. "
460,Kari Bañuelos,"Let's just cut to the chase--any classic is classic for a reason. But when it comes to Catcher in the Rye, I begin to question where all the hype is coming from, why the character is quoted by many young teens, and why so many teens feel the need to relate with the protagonist of this book. Holden Caulfield is a pretentious youth trying so desperately to find something real and not ""phony."" I found it interesting that my high school English teachers called me the Holden Caulfield of my graduating class because I lacked school spirit and hated everyone, yet, if a character so greatly sums me up, then why did I absolutely despise the book? I found it to be repetitious and pretentious, and completely a waste. The character development to me was weak, and the only thing I enjoyed throughout the entire thing was his relationship with his sister Phoebe.What really bakes my noodle is that this book has killed people, distorting what is real and what is fake. According to Holden and John Lennon's killer, people high in society are ""phonies"" and aren't beautiful, but when faced with all of the attention that people of power face in regards to exploitation and lack of privacy, we can not trivialize the experiences of folks like that nor degrade their values in trying to mobilize a movement for the better good of people (aka, John Lennon's appraisal of the 1960's Peace Movement). Overall, reading this book has been a shoulder shrug, and I think that books should be accounted for by their merit rather than their ""classic"" standing--sometimes people really don't like classics, and sometimes, books shouldn't be labeled as such."
461,Dana Altassan,"I hated this book it's so depressing how much Holand (the main character) says that everything depresses him. Seriously through the whole book in every page four words were repeated; depressing, hate, phony, and chrissake (or goddamn). However I'll admit I liked the last two chapters but they were definitely not worth it."
462,Susan Robertson,"I had to read this in school. I hated it I think teenage angst is made up of whiny, unapprieciative people, looking for an excuse to be unhappy. I feel the same way about that James Dean movie and his character. I have forgotten the name of the movie. Sorry. "
463,Jennifer Navarro,"Me pareció infumable, lo siento."
464,Darkpool (protesting GR censorship),"Maybe I was too young. I thought it was stupid. Ridiculous. Why would anyone behave like that. I was a teenager when I read this, so naturally I knew everything, and I knew this was lame. Still, not going to read it again now I'm old and wise: what if I was wrong? What if I was right???"
465,Sarah Jane,i have no idea why this autor decided to write this book because all it said was curse words. Ive tried to get into this one but the cursing is just terribly distracting. i hated it as well. 
466,Umar Hashmi,"What a phony-ass book. JD Salinger in his own words: Two-faced, conceited phony basta*d who can't not use goddam in every goddam sentence. As phony as people can get, this just blows them all out of the phony waters. Helluva depressing book, if you really want to know."
467,Brenda,"Don't waste your time reading this crap. It took me 3 months to read this book and I want them back! I just read it because a friend of mine gave it to me, although when she gave it to me she hadn't read it either, so I won't blame her. "
468,Lys,"Credo che ""Il Giovane Holden"" sia uno dei classici libri che o si ama o si odia. Bene, io lo detesto.Ho iniziato a detestarlo fin dalla prima pagina e il giudizio non è cambiato arrivando all'ultima."
469,Mackenzie Guinn," I read this for the first time this year and when I read it, I read more against the grain and thought the theme of the book was that it was o.k. to be hateful to people. So many have already seen this theme and have tried to kill people because of it. I think that even though Salinger tried to show the theme of maintaining innocence he also showed that it was o.k. to be hateful and feel superior to other people because this is how Holden Caulfield treats almost everybody in the book and has Holden do actions that confuse the reader if he is truly trying to maintain innocence because I feel that Holden isn't really trying to maintain his innocence because he's constantly smoking and drinking throughout the novel. If that wasn't enough, Holden also hires a prostitute later on. I think Holden isn't really trying to maintain his innocence, but rather he is trying to throw it away and doesn't care about his future."
470,Michele,Read this in high school. It was supposed to represent how a teenager thinks. I thought it was depressing and I didn't understand Holden Caulfield. Maybe I should re-read it as an adult. Maybe..
471,Scotty,"i don't trust a man with a limp handshake, and i don't put qualitative stock into the literary opinions of people who enjoyed catcher in the rye. not sure which i find more offensive: the self-absorbed narcissist main character or the people who relate to him."
472,Alissa,Horrible horrible horrible book. I actually feel more stupid having read this book. I can't believe they call this an American classic - how embarrassing. 
473,Audrey George,Required reading in High School. I swear I dont know a single woman that enjoyed this book and most guys love it. What's that about???
474,Joel York,"I hated this book. The characters weren't interesting. I felt no connection to the protagonist or any feeling aside from disdain. There isn't even a full story, just a jumble of events that makes me think the author went on a bad acid trip and this boring story dripped onto the page from him drooling. "
475,Ally Webb,I just deeply hated this book.
476,L.E. Truscott,"What a disappointment! This is the latest in a long line of “classic” books that when I finally get around to reading them, they aren’t worth even a fraction of the praise that has for so long been doled out and certainly weren’t worth the time spent reading them.Told in the first person by Holden Caulfield, this is the story of – to be frank – nothing very interesting and nothing much happening. The main character is sixteen and the book’s one achievement is capturing something very much resembling the true voice of a self-involved, alcoholic, chauvinistic teenager who doesn’t like anybody but can’t bear to be alone. Unfortunately, that character is not someone you want to spend time with. He’s whiney, unwitty and boring.He’s been kicked out of his prestigious boarding school after failing everything except English (and if this is one of those semi-autobiographical novels, then Holden should have failed English as well based on this effort). Instead of going home, he checks into a hotel in New York. He constantly goes to bars and tries his luck at ordering drinks. Some bartenders won’t serve him because of his age, others do. He tries unsuccessfully chatting up various women (no wonder, he’s about as appealing as a schnauzer licking his balls and then trying to lick your face), then gets tricked into paying a prostitute for services not rendered, he has breakfast with some nuns, he goes on a date with an old girlfriend who he treats appallingly, he goes to see a movie (even though he’s spent a good portion of the book up until now telling the reader how much he hates the movies), he meets up with an old acquaintance who clearly can’t stand him, he gets ridiculously drunk, he sneaks into his family’s apartment to “chew the fat” with his kid sister, he sneaks back out to go visit an old teacher, then runs away when he thinks the teacher is trying to molest him, he sleeps at a train station, then meets up with his kid sister again and takes her to a playground. That’s pretty much it. The missing subtitle from this novel could have been “A Narcissist’s Guide to New York”.Holden thinks everybody around him is a phony, which is ironic because he seems to be the biggest phony in the book. He doesn’t know his own true self but he thinks he’s better than everyone without any genuine evidence to support that belief. He clearly has mental health issues in addition to his numerous personality disorders but the author isn’t able to articulate them any better than having Holden constantly describe himself as depressed.The whole time I was reading this book, I kept thinking it sounded much like the kind of bad novel a teenage boy might write before compiling a manifesto and then going on a killing spree. If you want to read an example of what I think the writer intended to do but done right, I would recommend Stephen Chbosky’s The Perks of Being a Wallflower, which isn’t a perfect book either but is about a hundred times better and more well written than this."
477,Lama Alaifan,"I gave this book 1 star because I definitely wasn't enjoying myself reading this; instead, I just wanted to keep flipping the pages to see if anything interesting will finally happen, but nothing did. However, as I was reading it, I could picture myself in English class studying it. I believe it's a book filled with metaphors, symbolism, hidden meanings, and themes that I'm just not that talented in English to pick up and understand myself. However, if I studied this novel as a class and had the teacher guide us and tell us about the deeper meanings, the use of secondary characters, and the symbolism in this book, I think I would have enjoyed it and appreciated it a lot more."
478,Nick Muhart,"HOLDEN FREAKIN CAULFIELD WAS SO ANNOYING!! The book was pretty good at some parts, but Holden just made everything so annoying and terrible. "
479,Paťa Danišová,I cant... I just.... cant! 25% done. 
480,RuthAnn,"Would recommend: NoI know it's sacrilegious, but I really didn't like Catcher. I read it in high school with a bitter teacher who never let us forget that she was just teaching until she got her book deal, so I'm sure that it didn't help that she loved this book and called it her ""junior high Bible."" I didn't connect with Holden, and I felt like all of my friends liked the book simply because it was censored and contained profanity. I appreciate its cultural significance, so maybe I'll give it a try another time, but I have no great desire to do so."
481,Garrett," I absolutely hated Holden Caulfield and this entire boring, pointless book. How is this an American classic?"
482,Brandon Owen,"Summary Tease	The Catcher in the Rye is a fictional tale set in the 1950’s told by the story’s main character, Holden Caulfield. Holden is a 16 year old high school student who has just been kicked out of yet another school for his poor grades. Upon receiving this expulsion notice he understands that he is supposed to return home and face his parents in four days, but that is not what he does. Instead of immediately returning home he chooses to act as a sort of vagabond, floating around New York and just doing what he feels like. This is essentially where most of the story takes place as Holden narrates his actions and his thoughts while he lives day to day doing whatever he wants to. In this wishy-washy adventure Holden is constantly searching for something but he never knows what he is looking for or where he will find it, yet it is in these elements alone that the charm is found.Who might be interested in this book? Why?	In my opinion I don’t really think there’s many people out there that would truly enjoy this book, but seeing that it is a college readiness book that is apparently not true. The people that I see enjoying this book the most would be teenagers that can relate to the confusing way Holden feels throughout the story. Also, those going into college would be interested in this book because they might need to have read it for a class. I suppose anyone interested in the culture and slang of the 1950’s would also take a liking in this book. Finally, those who are assigned to read this book for a grade might also be interested in this book.Overall Satisfaction	I’m not going to lie; I hated everything about this book. I understand that that is a little exaggerate sounding, but I am a tough book critic, and there was absolutely nothing about this book that I liked. I found the book dull and uninteresting, I thought the main character was just annoying, and above all else I found no plot in the story whatsoever. The entire book is one mindless adventure that has no real beginning and no real end, all guided by an insane teenager. I will never understand how this book snuck its way onto the college readiness list or how it’s even allowed in high schools. Needless to say, I didn’t like it very much.Literary skills:Imagery, foreshadowing, and diction"
483,Hilary,"Maybe I just didn't get this book, but I was not a fan. Holden just seemed like an overprivileged spoiled brat who deserved all the bad stuff that happened to him. I actually wouldn't have minded if he had worse happen to him.... he would have deserved that too."
484,William Thompson,"To say I didn't ""get"" this book would be an understatement, I finished it out of pure stubbornness but I didn't enjoy it, not even for a second. "
485,Charles Goodwin,"Maybe Holden should've been hospitalized long before. Mostly, he's a self-indulgent jerk. The narrative voice is grating or something. "
486,Carl Mayo,"Absolutely the worst book I have ever read. This book drags on and on without going anywhere. If I wanted to listen to a kid complain for hours on end, I can get that without having to read it.After reading it for myself, I can almost believe the conspiracy theories about this book being an MK Ultra mind-control trigger. No wonder Mark David Chapman & John Hinckley were obsessed with it. Catcher in the Rye is enough to drive anyone crazy. Utterly horrible, and painful to read. "
487,Monica ,I did not like this book. It may have helped if I had actually realized that it stated on the first page taht he had just been released from the mental hospital ;) 
488,Ginevra Weasley-Potter,"I thought that it was well-written, but it does not have a plot or a good set of characters. Although, Phoebe is my favorite character because she is honest."
489,Shanna,"This book could almost be defined as a waste of time. I didn't enjoy it in the least. This kid complains and seems completely oblivious to the real world. I don't understand why people give it such rave reviews. If you want a time-waster, this book is for you."
490,Tina,Holden has to be one of the obnoxious characters in all of literature. There is absolutely nothing redeeming about this book.
491,Ines,One of those books...couldn't go past the first chapter or so....not impressed....
492,Courteney,"If it were an option I would give this book less than half a star. The main character elicits no sympathy from me, if I had met him in real life I might very well have told him to shut the fuck up and get a damn life instead of wining about how good he's got it. In the end this is the only book I have ever seriously considered throwing in a fireplace."
493,Lee,"Highly overated. As many others, I heard about this book in my teenage years and was interested to see what the fuss was about but sorely let down by a boring story line and a lead character whose observations throughout the novel are as shallow as a pool of piss. Salinger's short stories are better."
494,Katri,"Koko kirjan odotin, että mitä tässä tapahtuu, ja petyin aika pahasti kun mitään ei koskaan tapahtunutkaan. Tai ei ainakaan sitä käännekohtaa. Kiitos siitä, että kirjan luki melko nopeasti (tai olisi lukenut nopeamminkin, jos olisi ollut aikaa). Saa tulla kertomaan, mikä se juttu tässä kirjassa on, koska itse en sitä keksinyt."
495,Jeff Raymond,"Among the things that I should love but can’t are Wes Anderson movies, American Chop Suey, and Catcher in the Rye. I don’t know if I’m just not angry enough at the world, or if I just find this book so blatantly painful that it just doesn’t want to register, but this book just does absolutely nothing for me, and I’m always significantly confused when people tell me that they love it. Utterly and completely confused. The book, to me, just comes across as very trite and annoying, and I struggle to see where the real meaning comes from. It’s almost like a venting of faux anger and rage as opposed to anything really great and substantial.Then again, I spend an inordinate amount of time reading YA chick lit, so..."
496,Elena Puerto,"I had to read this for my literature class and also, I had to do some work of it. And I think that's why I didn't enjoy it. It was so boring. I hope I will re read it some time in the nex few months, and like it more."
497,Jaeson,Overrated. Annoying. Waste of time.
498,Lex,"I really rather loathed this book. The character was weak and boring and indecisive and not particularly good (in the ethical sense) at the beginning, and he really hasn't changed much by the end. He rambles forever about things I found it impossible to care about in a voice that felt like nails on a chalkboard to me. The whole thing felt like a run-on sentence in a New Jersey accent with no particular plot... It was all I could do to get through it, and I took nothing of note from reading it (not for lack of trying)."
499,Keith,"Look kids, everyone you know who likes this book needs to be thrown in the dumbass pile. Male fantasy pseudo-intellectualism that's been crapping all over the minds of young men for generations. The audience for this book is the same bunch of dudes that get teary-eyed over 'Fight Club.' All you guys seriously just have to start wanking one another off and get this dewy-eyed male hardship crap out of your systems."
500,Ankita,Is there an option of giving it 0 stars?
501,Shawna Henderson,"This book has been on my shelf for years. I did'nt know what it was about so I never really bothered to read it.I finally got it out when the library was taking too long getting my other books sent (grrr.).First of all, I don't understand why this book is a ""classic"". It's basically about nothing. A teenage boy running around acting crazy. It was really hard for me to get through because it was so boring.That being said, once I finished it I was glad that I read it. Can't explain it, but there it is. Extremely boring yet semi-satisfying? I still just don't understand."
502,Deborah Hector,"I just don't get the hype. You have a kid going crazy in NY. Wanting to sleep with a prostitute, not wanting to sleep with a prostitute. Calling the world fake, when he seems to be the most fake person. And then he goes and gets himself molested. Smh, as I said before, just don't get the hype"
503,Steven,Meh. Who cares? The whole thing just leaves me shrugging my shoulders. What's the big deal about Catcher in the Rye? I just don't get it.
504,Makenzie,"What was so great about this? I have enough going on in my own head, I didn't need to know what was going on in his head!!"
505,Marlo,I cannot understand why this book is so hugely popular... if I wanted to hear a teenage boy be moody I would walk around down town.
506,Marlee,"*sigh* I'm not sure where to start on this one. It was just so BAD. I guess to make it clearer, I should break it down. Characters: Holden is the focus here, since there weren't really any others of significance. However, my criticisms of Holden could fill a book. He's a flat, uninteresting character with the passive, cynical, angry, depressed outlook on life. He should be attending therapy, not roaming the streets of NYC. Don't get me wrong, usually the moody, darker characters are more interesting. But Holden was so sour and whiny all the time I wanted to brain him rather than relate to him.Plot: Plot? What's a plot? Ohhhh, you mean that device in literature where events happen in a specific sequence to keep you entertained and guessing as to what will happen next? Where the characters undergo struggles and come out changed, for better or worse? Yeah, there wasn't one. I mean seriously, what happened? In no particular order, Holden got depressed, left school, got drunk, hit on a girl, visited some old teachers, saw his sister, reminisced about some ducks… All the time whining and complaining he didn't feel like doing anything. This guy was so lazy he went all the trouble of calling a prostitute to his room and getting all dressed up for her, and then deciding he didn't feel like sex. It wasn't even a question of morals, he was just too tired. Throughout the whole book, I learned nothing about him except that he's annoying. I wasn't even entertained because he never changed or learned anything about himself.Writing: Did you hear that? That was the sound of my intellect dying a slow, painful death of frustration and boredom. I am not joking here: I firmly believe that 214 pages the word ""goddamn"" was used at least 500 times. Swearing in books doesn't bother me that much, but COME UP WITH A NEW ADJECTIVE!!! The English language is expansive, give me a little variety. And that was not the only repetition. I quote: ""my aunt's pretty charitable – she does a lot of Red Cross work and all – but she's very well-dressed and all, and when she does anything charitable she's always very well dressed and has lipstick on...."" This is what the whole book was like: repetitive and underwhelming.In short, I would avoid this book like the plague. I got nothing from it but appreciation for other literature. 13–14+ for language and a few sexual references."
507,Dave Jones,For the life of me I don't understand why people adore this book with the passion they do. I don't understand why it's considered a classic. 
508,Madison,"I found this book neither entertaining, persuasive, or informative. I finished the book feeling hatred for the main character and mad at the lack of story arc. Holden seems to have a combination of bipolar, ADHD, and tourrets symptoms. Since he is the storyteller the book is very hard to follow at times. Why is this a classic?"
509,Andrew King,Blah! If you enjoy reading about a self absorbed brat whine and complain about everything then this is the book for you. I believe it is a waste of time and wish I had never read it. 
510,Sharath Gopal,I was expecting something profound.Instead I got 6 hours of nonstop whining.If I could meet Caulfield I'd want to smack some sense into him and tell him to grow a spine.Why this is so popular I'll never know
511,Kassandra,I honestly didn't know what to expect from this book but I wanted to love it but I couldn't. I didn't care hat would happen in the end and I didn't care for any of the characters. I was very bored reading this book and I thought I would never finish it.
512,Lynne,Read this for B&N book discussion group. It was painful to read! Anxious to hear the discussion about it.
513,Shumaila,"Honestly, I didn't see what all the hype was about regarding this book. I bought it solely because it was referred to as great reading and it was actually a disappointment. I didn't like the style of writing as it was too crude.I did however go into the meanings of the book itself and although it wasn't greatly inspiring (unlike The Great Gatsby) but I guess some parts were ok.Overall, not a recommended read but if you want to be able to say you've read a classic, its an option..not one I'd personally recommend though!"
514,Kate Foley,(Review was deleted for some reason . . . Odd.)The only reason why I gave this book 1 star was because I couldn't give it 0.
515,Emir Ibañez,Nope. Just... no.
516,Karen Wayman,"I am probably the only person on the face of the earth that did not like The Catcher in the Rye. Somehow I got through high school without having to read it. However, it was my grandmother's favorite book and she gave me her personal copy of it. I didn't read it until after she died (thank goodness) because I would have hated to have to tell her I didn't like it. Reading it was nothing but depressing for me, and actually made me feel somewhat shallow as I just didn't ""get"" it like some many people have. I'd love to know if anyone else out there felt the same."
517,Laura Jean,"My ex and I had a discussion about this book. I said that Holden Caulfield was as false and one dimensional as the people he complained about. My ex insisted that Caulfield was allowed this, because he was a disillusioned teenager. When I read this as a disillusioned teenager, I thought Holden Caulfield was a whiny-ass rich kid who didn't care about being a contributing member of society and romanticized mediocrity. I still hold that opinion. Many of my friends love this book. Maybe I should read it again."
518,Suzannah,I didn't enjoy this book at all when I read it in High School and have felt zero inclination to return to it since.
519,Abdullah,"I'm not exactly sure what's wrong with this book. I mean with all the swear words you would find in every page in it. Plus I didn't like the main character.As one of the reviewers on GoodReads said:""the main character is so irritating I couldn't focus on anything else. I'd rather rub sand on my eyeballs.""and I couldn't agree more! Holden is so irritating, the way he talks, the things he says, and the way he nags about every single thing.I might read it again someday, and maybe this time would be in Arabic.I believe the translated version is titled: ""الحارس في حقل الشوفان"""
520,Jaqueline Cazares,"I do not recommend this book The Cather in the Rye. One reason why I don't recommend this book to be taught is because some young people will think its cool to be just like Holden. The reason why some teenagers think it's okay to do what Holden is doing is because they feel like it's okay to drop out of school and runaway. The second reason why I think it's not okay to read this book is some people will feel offended by some of things Holden says or does. The reason why the might get offended is by the rude comments he says some teens might get offended and feel like it's towards them. Also some teens feel like its a boring book to read, they feel like it's not worth reading. Also if parents find out they're reading The Catcher in the Rye they will feel like its a bad influence on their children. Parents will feel like they will follow the same footsteps as Holden and end up dropping out and living a crazy life."
521,Ashley Rivera,"This overrated pile of trash has done nothing but make me absurdly self-conscious when writing anything in the first person, for fear of sounding anything even remotely similar in voice. I successfully avoided reading it in high school and now, on the other side, think fondly back to the days when that was still the only truth."
522,Aaron,"Honestly, if this wasn’t a classic, I would have stopped reading it. Basically, this book can be summed up in three words: hypocrites and phonies. The main character thinks most everybody else is a phony. For examples of hypocrisy, on p. 172:“I’m not too sure old Phoebe knew what the hell I was talking about. I mean she’s only a little child and all. But she was listening, at least. If somebody at least listens, it’s not too bad. “Daddy’s going to kill you. He’s going to kill you,” she said. I wasn’t listening, though.You can repeat that sort of hypocrisy 40+ times throughout this book. Another example of that is in the beginning, where he complains he has to ask two of his friends 50 times to get them to do something (like don’t sit on the bed), but then a few pages later those friends repeatedly ask him to do something until he finally does it. Later in the book (p.86), he’s at a bar alone and wants company, but when someone he knows says hello, he tells her he was just leaving, because he doesn’t feel like talking.And of course, the author leaves it to the kid sister to explain to the audience the trouble of the main character (p. 169): “You don’t like anything that’s happening.” Gee, really? You think we couldn’t figure that out ourselves?The one moment I enjoyed was only more because it was weird: (p. 158) – “Our foyer has a funny smell that doesn’t smell like anyplace else. I don’t know what the hell it is. It isn’t cauliflower and it isn’t perfume – I don’t know what the hell it is- buy you always know you’re home.” I’m not sure what the smell could be either if the two closest scents are cauliflower and perfume…"
523,Kristi,"I read it as required reading in high school. The book is pretty filthy, I would not recommend it. The only redeeming quality is that it ends up trashing on immoral life styles. You have to read a lot of filth first though."
524,Maryann,Too much swearing.
525,Jeff Sauri,"Holden Caufield is the most annoying, self-centered, and most importantly hypocritical character I have encountered in a long time. I read this as a teenager and was thoroughly annoyed by the whining of this privileged, clueless youth. I re-read it twice more over the years to make sure it wasn't just me since so many people seemed to love this book. But I could never wait to get through it. If I had written this book, I'd be a recluse too."
526,Nial O'Farrell,This was very tedious and just about a whiny teenager who seemed depressed to me. It seemed to me to be an overrated classic.Disappointing.
527,Floris,Made it to page 56 with the greatest difficulty. This book (like the life of the protagonist) is extremely boring and depressing. The language of the protagonist (or writing style) is repetitive and annoying. This isn't very surprising. It's about a cynical teenager who doesn't enjoy life yet. Salinger gave nothing extra to overcome this shaky start. 'Sonuvabitch'
528,Keith Jones,I just wanted to smack the little bastard upside the head. I'll never forgive Six Degrees of Separation for tricking me into reading this thing.
529,Chrissy Gregori,"I understand why first person is called claustrophobic. At the beginning of the story I laughed out loud and liked the voice of the protagonist. I lost my admiration and found the character to be indulged, arbitrary and . Nothing happened in the story and I felt the character was bipolar. "
530,Shawn,I just didn't like this one. I really did not like Holden Caulfield at all. I found him to be unlikeable and arrogant. This one just wasn't for me.
531,Shiela Chan,"A point of view of a teen rebelling written by an adult on how he thinks a teen rebel acts like. I couldn't stand the main character because he feels so arrogant and forcibly written with an exaggerated persona. Whether or not that was the point, I didn't enjoy this 'classic'. "
532,Elena,"A confession: Despite the number of times I've been assigned to read this book, or decide to revisit it, I've never managed to get to the end of the book. Nothing about it is appealing to me - I don't like the characters, I don't like the language, I don't like the plot....I know it's an American classic, but I just don't like it."
533,Lawrence Humphreys,I hated this book with much intensity. Reading it messed me up emotionally. I think I would be better off in almost every respect if I had not read this book at all.
534,Ruthie,"i thought this book was so pointless! i'd heard it was about alienation and exploring self, but i didn't get any of that. all i saw was some kid who swore way too much getting hit on my his male teacher and paying for a hooker who he didn't sleep with. when my dad got his GED he had to read this book. i guess he told my mom about it and they both thought so little of it that she said if the school ever asked us to read it she would rather we take an F for that assignment. i read it after college and kept waiting for the good part, which never came. why this book is a classic is beyond me."
535,Emma Victoria Mason-Phelps,....Hated everything about this book. Pages upon pages of whining and bitching.
536,Steph Su,"I have tried, many times over the course of my life, to read this book, in order to try to understand its celebrated status as the story of one of the most quintessential adolescent protagonists of all time. But Holden Caulfield is absolutely the most obnoxious AND stupid character I have ever forced myself to encounter. And, as I do my best to avoid ignorant, obnoxious people in real life, and already have a hard enough time doing so, I admit that I cannot force myself to waste time on the kind of character who I would hate with every fiber of my being were he a real boy."
537,January,"My rating says one star, but I hated this book. I thought it was the most anti-climatic book I have ever read. Truely a waste of my time!"
538,Clruss,This book is painful to read. It's like drinking a warm beer you thought was going to be ice cold. You wanted to drink it because you heard ice cold beer is great. But since its warm its not as enjoyable as everyone said it would be. 
539,Ian Zimmerman,"I actually am unable to get through this book. Reading the phone book is more fun. Getting cavities filled is more fun. I was engaged in a fierce internal debate on how to rate this one. Ian #1 said, ""you can't give it a 1, it is viewed as a classic and its level of influence and historical significance is simly too high!"" Ian #2 said, ""Fuck it! I hate this book, I'm giving it a 1! Ian #2 won in a brutal fight in which raw hatred overcame aesthetics."
540,Sabhya,I couldn't even finish this book and i generally try to read all books i start till the end with hopes that the ending will change me or be mind blowing. With this book i was sure that the protaganist Holden will continue to roam around aimlessly calling everyone a pony when he himself one book hypocrite. There is no real plot. Just a train of thought. Sometimes a reverie of thoughts makes an interesting read for eg in salman rushdie's novels but Holden's reminiscents and ideas are just monotonous.Lovers of this book who call it a classic may say that i dont get it. Msybe i dont but i sure dont like it.
541,Kaycee Looney,I wasn't impressed with this book at all. I forced myself to finish it but wouldn't read it again. (I can see Traci cringing right now.)
542,Charlie Payne,I rated this book one star because it is extremely boring. All Holden talks about is how depressed he is and how he basically has no friends. There was not one thing that he said that was happy. I like books that have big events and excite the reader. The whole time I wanted to just be done with the book. I would never recommend this book to anybody. 
543,Nancy Jefferies,Read this in high school and the book stinks! It's full of swearing and little if anything of redeeming value.
544,Marianne,hated it... the teenage angst was nauseating - wanted to smack the brat upside his head. I don't understand the appeal... or the acclaim.
545,Toni,Not a fan
546,Melody Savage," The one star is for Phoebe's character. The Catcher in the Rye is mentioned in nearly every discussion of book-banning because of the frequent use of foul language and the rather raw discussion of teen suicide, promiscuity, and violence.  Holden Caulfield, expelled from another boys' private school, heads home and we accompany his thoughts and activities for a few days. I did not read this book in it's entirety. I read the first few chapters carefully and then dipped and skimmed looking for the book's acclaimed value. There are some gold flakes to sift from the mud - the beauty and freedom of childhood juxtaposed against the gritty, soiled feeling of trading naivete for experience with ugly realites - but it's not worth wading through the bad language and depressed perspective. At first, I concluded Holden was suffering from anxiety and depression, and therefore his account was a tour of his dysfunctional psyche. But now I think Holden epitomizes many angst-filled teens. I would not recommend this book. If a teen chooses to read it, parents ought to read it, too, to talk about the issues and listen to feelings that may surface. There is no doubt of Salinger's artistry, especially in his characterization of Phoebe and her distinct role in illuminating his theme, but surely there are or can be books that examine the issues and treat the golden theme without going overboard on the language and vulgarity."
547,Kendra Conine,"This book, it kills me. It really does."
548,Oleksiy Kononov,Struggled to finish the book only because it's praised as a piece (master-piece or not really) of the American classical literature and bla-bla. Didn't like it a bit
549,Sora ,"I've heard many good things about The Catcher in the Rye. So I had great expectations. Then started to read and... disappointment.Holden Caulfield hates nearly everyone around him. Because people are corrapted, selfish, thoughtless and he doesn't want to become another corrapted, selfish, thoughtless grown-up. He loves innocence of little children. He wants protect their and his own innocence. This sounds good, right? Yeah, but it wasn't a great story as everyone who recommended told me. I don't understand the big deal with this book. I neither like Holden nor the book. I appreciate how the ending was written beautifully tho. "
550,Tony,"Why is this book so (in)famous? Why the hell did two noted contemporary assassins/attempted assassins seek to mold their lives after the whiny, moronic, self-centered little douche-bag of a main character, Holden Caulfield? Reading this novel is no different then thumbing through several arduously written teenage emo blogs and deleting all the exciting stuff they lie about doing. Ugh. Don't buy this unless you need to check in with Jean-Luc Picard and his clandestine organization-du-jour. "
551,Aiobhan,I want to punch Holden in the face.
552,Rupesh Goenka,"Irritating, Boring, Worthless.. The author was depressed while writing the book.. If only foul language can make a pathetic book read good..."
553,Josh,"This book was the worst piece of shit I've ever read. It's no wonder it drives people to kill. They want those 200 pages of their life back. That's certainly how I felt anyhow. But, who would I kill, George Michael? Art Alexakis? It just didn't feel worth the effort since they were already killing their careers more effectively than any gun."
554,Deanna,"This has to be the worst book I have ever actually finished in my entire life. There is no plot whatsoever and he basically rambles. The writing style is horrendous and the ending does nothing. Holden is both annoying and disturbing and very hypocritical. He calls everyone a phony when really he is hiding his identity. He is insane and the only thing you could possibly do to this book is psychoanalize it. If you don't have to, don't read this book. Save yourself!!!"
555,Abigail,"I don't care if it's a classic. I really, really, really hate this book. I can't stand Holden and I wish there was a freaking story line."
556,Lauren Deleon,"This book drpressed me simply because the main character of the story is forever going on and on complaining, every time i read it i was in a bad mood. no bueno"
557,Paulina Skowrońska,"If I could give this book a minus review, I would do it. God help me, how much I suffered while reading and hated this book. I found no lesson there, even more, I felt like I lost some of my intelligence simply because of the way the book is written. The language cries out to heaven for vengeance. Did you know that Holden used the phrase ""and all"" 309 times since p23 till the end? Well, I do know. Because I counted. That and ""phony"", ""lousy"", ""sort of"", ""or anything"" and ""or something"". It made me pick up my phone every 5 seconds to write it down. Holden himself is an arrogant, childish ignorant who acts like world's rules don't apply to him. He's seventeen, yet acts like a six years old pretending to be an adult. He knows nothing about the real world and only frustrates the hell out of you. If I could, I would slap the author in the face with this book."
558,Zoë  Molina ,"1.5 Even though the main character drove me crazy, the ending was kinda nice. "
559,Melissa,I know a lot of smart people who love this book but I can't get into it for the life of me and I've tried a number of times. Does it get a lot better after the beginning? Should I try again??
560,Chelsea Flint,"Had this not been an assigned read, I wouldn't have bothered at all to finish it."
561,Maya,"I really didn't like this book. It never had a plot and it felt like someone was just ranting and complaining the whole time, never actually going anywhere with anything. "
562,Ury949,"Wow. Now I understand why I didn't remember a single thing about this book from reading it back in high school. It's basically a long-winded rant by a teenage boy who seems to have a grudge against practically everything and everyone. He spends so much time complaining about how stupid and lame everything is that he hardly notices what's going on in the world. Barely anything actually happens in the story.Was this really part of my English Lit curriculum? I'm kind of disappointed. I obviously didn't get anything out of it, but it's referenced so much and commonly used as a comparison tool, so I felt like I should re-familiarize myself with it. But I could have read the first page and that would have been enough. To be honest, I couldn't even finish it."
563,Arianne Mix,"Reading this book made me think and question, which I like. When I finished, I read different commentaries on it in an attempt to gain more appreciation for it. Some said that Holden was a catcher in the rye by deciding to stay home for his sister. Some said that Phoebe was a catcher in the rye because she saved Holden and that we should all strive to be like her. The latter simply doesn't make sense to me because Holden wasn't saved. In the last pages of the book he seemed to be heading down the exact same road as he was at the beginning of the book. He didn't seem to progress. If the former interpretation is correct, then so what? At first, it seemed like Holden saw how much his sister had idealized him and didn't want her to follow in his footsteps. But that didn't change anything, either! He still seemed pretty resigned to failing school and life. It's sad, because Holden wanted to be good and he wanted to be a catcher in the rye but he was so messed up he couldn't do much.So anyway, I see why this book is a classic--like I said, it made me think--and I can see why some people love it, but I hated it. It was really frustrating to read about a boy who was destroying his life and ignoring the people who genuinely wanted to help him. I didn't like reading about all of the phony people that drove him crazy while he did every single thing that he condemned in others. I felt bad for him. He was severely depressed, suffered from anxiety (and who knows what else), was destroying his body with drugs, and refused to accept help or face his problems. Even at the end of the book. So yeah. I'm glad I read it, though."
564,Traci,"Normally if I don't like a book I'm not going to put much thought into critiquing it, unless it can be helpful. But it's a pleasure, probably the only pleasure to get out of reading this terrible novel. I absolutely hated it and the idea they forced it on youngsters, I think, could be considered child abuse.There was nothing to take from it but that it was easy to read and probably the only book some young adults can finish, so then they think it's great. But it was dreary, depressing, and void of any real feeling or thought."
565,Pihla,"Maybe I was too old to read it now for the first time, but this did not feel like a classic to me. Really didn't get it."
566,Andrew,The book didn't really make sense to me. It was all over the place and hard to understand. I wouldn't really recommend it to any one.
567,Tracy,"I don't see why this book is supposed to be a classic...really I don't. I think it's kind of a crumby book if you ask me, I do I really do."
568,Andrea,"I forced myself to finish this book because it was a classic. Most of my male friends like it, which makes me wonder if my dislike for this book has anything to do with being a female, not a teenager anymore, and not being able to stand whiny people. Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I was younger but I hardly doubt it. "
569,E,"I've heard that this is one of those books you either love or you hate, and I hated it. Holden Caulfield basically just annoyed the bejeezes out of me, which I think kept me from enjoying the deeper nuances of the story."
570,Toota,رواية على لسان مراهق.. أثارت في العديد من مشاعر الكآبة لكثرة ما فيها من الفاظ لم تعجبني ومن مشاعر الفتى المراهق الذي يصف بالتفصيل مشاعره الوصفية تجاه كل شيء..لم أحبها ..حقيقة لم أفعل !!
571,Lauren Thomson,OMG - who decided this book should be placed up there with the literary classics. Feel like I lost a few good hours of reading time on this silly book.
572,Oldcode,"Filled with angst and no purpose. I just couldn't care about the main character. He's bumbling around, no drive, no desire. I just don't have time to read about a angsty teen wondering around New York and flunking out of school. I don't even connect with him when comparing him to myself when I was that age. I had to put it down on page 104 of 214. "
573,The Cats Mother,"This is one of those classics that I never got around to reading in school, had always heard of, knew the name of the central character, but had no idea what it was about. Well I spent the whole book waiting for the story to begin, hating the """"hero"""" and wondering how it ended up in the top 100. I suppose a teenager in the same state of mind could relate, but to me Holden is just selfish, whiney, and annoying, and I was skiiming through it by the end just to finish it and move on to something more enjoyable."
574,Bolong,"J.D. goes on and on about phony people and crumby things. I stopped reading less than halfway into the book - I'll spend my time on better ones - so I don't think I can much judge it. But a certain feeling at the back of my chest tells me that nothing much eventful is going to happen around the book. Anyway, this book doesn't entirely thrill me because of how extremely repetitive Holden's thoughts are. He talks about terribly small things like how people wear their socks, how they walk around - and at length - and then meets this phony person and that phony person. I guess it's good characterization, but it isn't in any way much meaningful to me, so I end up falling asleep half the time. Forgive me for not being able to appreciate what wonders of a book it is."
575,Katie Robinson,"I feel like the kid must have felt in The Emperor's New Clothes. Like, it's supposed to be this brilliant (if crass) masterpiece of literature and I just... don't get it. I feel like I'm supposed to say it's brilliant because that's the intelligent response for people who are cultured or whatever, but it's maybe the dumbest thing I've ever read. And I've skimmed a Twilight book, so that's saying something."
576,Edie,I guess I don't 'relate' with the character in this book and therefore I do not understand the hype. I hope I never even meet someone who 'relates' to this character. 
577,Lucrezia ,"Non ce la faccio a finirlo...abbiate pietà, non se ne scende proprio. Sarò pure io a non capire nulla, ma sono a metà e non mi piace per niente."
578,Erica,Hated this book. Forced myself to read more than half and couldn't make it through any more. I read the ending on Wikpedia to see if that would help spur me on to finish and it only made me more certain that the book was not worth my time. Foul language and an angry/dysfunctional main character who I didn't like in a terribly boring storyline did nothing to entice me to keep reading. I don't know why this book is so highly critically reviewed.
579,Hunter Chaney,"My friend handed me this book (his favorite book ever) with a claim that it would change my life. Suffice to say, it didn't. It was a very fast read, and easy to follow, but intensely boring. The only reason I actually finished it is because I have trouble not giving books the benefit of the doubt and finishing them. I wish I hadn't.The entire book is basically a teenage boy whining. I will never understand the hype."
580,Nikki Edgar,Did not enjoy this book
581,Cockneylen,"Didn't really enjoy it much, perhaps I should have read it when I was still at school. I couldn't relate to his absolutely immature thought patterns. I felt all the way through that Caufield was a loser, and didn't get the impression that he would grow into anything else. It seems to appear on every list of ""books you need to read"", but why escapes me. Most books I've read on these lists are very good books, but, for me, this isn't one of them. "
582,Elaine ,I had read this in college. I didn't particularly like it then. However I think it should be read for a psychology class. I didn't like it any better this time
583,Wil,"What a terrible book! How is this a classic? Poorly written. No discernible plot. Unlikable characters. Shame, J.D.!"
584,Jess,"Fuck this book Holden you're a little shit Maybe RTC bc I actually have an assignment on it lol (cmd+c, cmd+v)Preview:1. As a teenager, can you relate to Holden’s experiences? Why or why not? Look, I get why Holden’s angry. I get why everything sucks, because it does! But it doesn’t mean that he has to whine about it. Do something, Holden! You have a choice and you have the ability to change your circumstances, so just do it! Listen to the great Shia LaBeouf. Honestly, complaining about something but refusing to take action is so infuriating. Adapt, son.2. How do you think Holden would find life in 2016? Would he survive, thrive or would he take a deep dive? Holden might survive. Social media has helped people be more honest, and because of the Internet, Holden would find it easy to find people who share his sentiments in the deep, dark reaches of hipster Tumblrs. However, phonies are more prominent than ever, with the ever-popular, ever-vapid Kardashians as the forerunners of the show (Holden would probably scream every time Kanye was mentioned). People are very self conscious of their public image, and are finding it easier to manipulate it. Holden would probably join Tinder ironically, only to end up chatting up girls until they were deemed idiotic. To say if he would survive, thrive or dive depends on when he was deposited into 2016. In any situation he would never thrive, however if he was born in Y2K, he would merely survive, and if he time travelled, he would die for reasons besides the obvious."
585,Justine Johnson,"I had to read this twice in school and hated it both times. Couldn't relate to the main characters whiny attitude and depressing wandering. Maybe I just didn't 'get' it, but it bored me to tears, so I couldn't bring myself to try very hard"
586,Harlen Bayha,Yeah. Another 'whatever' book. I tortured myself through this one because my mom told me that I was a cynical adolescent like Holden. Maybe I could find some meaning in it. All I found was a boring read.
587,Kelley,"I never read this book in high school and asked my friend, who may teach it, to let me read it first.I hated every bit of this book. First of all, the characters and setting are too dated to be interesting to today's teens. The words that Holden uses, like calling everyone ""old Sally"" for example, is distracting. The notion of being sent away to schools would be unknown to the teens that we deal with. The other characters in the story seem wooden, unemotional, uncaring. I couldn't like any of them. I thought that I would like the teacher at the end who lets him stay the night but then Holden wakes up with the teachers patting his head. Maybe I just don't get it but I think it's a huge waste of teaching time to inflict this book on our students. There is so much great teen literature that is capable of challenging our teens to think. I'm not sure why the book was/is so controversial. For that time, it's probably a pretty accurate portrait of a kid that losing it, however; at this point in time we have access to much better literature for teens."
588,AraBD,"La verdad, no le entendí, narra la vida de un adolescente, pero sentí que perdí mi tiempo leyéndolo (excepto porque cuenta como un libro para el Reto: 12 meses 12 libros), no le encontré sentido, enseñanza, moraleja, placer o diversión por leerlo."
589,Emily,I have no clue how this ridiculous rambling excuse of a book ever became a classic. This is absolutely the worst book I have ever read. 
590,Shelby,"I wish I could say that I even remotely enjoyed this book, because I have such a deep respect for all literature, but I just didn't like it. I don't like what the book stands for, which is that literature is pointless. This is the only book I've ever read that I felt was ""pointless"".And it's not that I don't get what it's about. I do. And that's what I don't like about it, is its very theme. At first I thought it was just because I was too young to understand it when I read it, but, alas, no.Maybe it's me -- I like books with meaning, or, at least, I like to find meaning in books -- but I've no respect and no liking for this book, or the idea it was founded on, at all. Read it for yourself, if you're curious. If you like it, more power to you. But I wouldn't personally recommend it."
591,Magdalena Rhinehart,"I read this book when I was younger and for some reason I quite liked it, but I just read it again and it was so boring! I know it's a really popular book but I have no idea why. I disliked the main character and there was no plot. I'd love to know what I liked about it when I was younger and what everyone is seeing in it that I don't."
592,Settare,داستان کتاب ، خلاصه ، راجع به هولدن کالیفلد ِ هیفده - هیجده ساله ست که از مدرسه اخراج شده و داستان چند روز سرگردونی اون ئه .مهم ترین نکته توی این کتاب ، اینه که اول از همه با هولدن ارتباط برقرار کنید . باید با هولدن دوست باشید و دوستش داشته باشید که بعد محو کتاب بشید و ازش لذت ببرید . خیلی خوبه . ولی متاسفانه من اصلا نتونستم باهاش ارتباط برقرار کنم. :دال برای من کاراکتر های یک کتاب خیلی مهمن . من در طول خوندن کتاب با اونا همراه میشم و معمولا خیلی ارتباط عمیقی (!) باهاشون دارم! در نتیجه اگه از کاراکتر کتاب خوشم نیاد ، کلا از کتاب هم خوشم نخواهد اومد .خب اقتضای سن هولدن این جوریه که خیلی عامیانه حرف میزنه ، و همچنین به هرچیزی که میرسه در حال فحش دادنه . در نتیجه تمام کتابی که از زبون چنین آدمی نقل بشه ، پر از این جور حرف زدنه. من اصولا از آدم هایی که راه میرن به در و دیوار و هرچه در جهان است فحش میدن خوشم نمیاد . هولدن خب جزو همین دسته از آدم هاست . البته سلینجر کار خودشو خوب انجام داده ، و اتفاقا آدم های زیادی هستن که از هولدن و طرز حرف زدنش خوششون بیاد و در نتیجه از کتابم خیلی لذت ببرن . کلا من این کتاب سلینجر رو به اندازه اون دو تای دیگه ای که ازش خوندم دوست نداشتم . 
593,ke-sha,If I could give it less then one star I would. I basically just liked the first two pages it went downhill from there.
594,Marsha,"I didn't really like this book. Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't understand the hype. I was just bored reading it..."
595,Nadia,"I know this book is supposed to be a classic teenage psychological angst novel that introduced a whole new genre of literature and opened up new vistas of stream-of-consciousness style writing, but, well, I hate it. It's whiny, boring, pointless and intensely irritating. Sorry. "
596,Sherry,"I picked this book up at the library as I have been on a bit of a classic novel kick lately. I was not impressed with this book at all. I found it quite dull, I kept waiting for something to happen. Which it never did. Really disappointed in this so called classic. "
597,Dad,"I read this book in my senior year of high school as part of an Advanced Placement class in English. I had an excellent teacher and he wanted us to have a varied experience in literature. I felt this particular book used too many profanities and talked of things that exist but don't need to be mentioned in a novel. Now I have experienced it, I would NOT recommend it for my children or grandchildren to read."
598,Dan,"After being so highly recommended and touted as such an insidious and incredible book, I was excited when it was assigned reading when I was in high school. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed in the novel. There was just very little going on, and the author's stream-of-consciousness type of writing was quirky and innovative only for a little while, before becoming very tedious and irritating later on in the novel. I understood the book, don't get me wrong, I just wasn't very impressed, nor entertained with any facet of it. The high expectations didn't help either."
599,Mike Griffin,"I know this won't make me popular but reading this was like watching an episode of Big Brother. A boring childish character is Holden and... Nothing happens, nothing. If not for a few scandals linked to this book it would not have become popular. Not a classic. "
600,Nicholas Grugin,I remember reading this in high school and HATING IT. Overrated
601,Dave,"Honestly, even though this is regarded as one of the most interesting and philisophically curious books ever written, BOTH times I read it, I found myself in excruciating pain as I turned each page.Holden's decisions were seemingly random, his responses to events and the other characters were ridiculous, and his entire demeanor suggested mental illness rather than hip and modern thought.I read it in high school and hated it. I re-read it after I graduated from college thinking that I would have a new insight, but the only thing I was clued in to was the fact that I should trust my first instinct from then on."
602,Alanoud Alajmi,"I've never hated a book as much as I hated this one. I literally hated every minute reading this. So much whining, repetition, and just...no resolution.I honestly can't write enough how bad it was for me."
603,Michelle Athy,"I read this book in tenth grade English. Our teacher said it was about a teenager and that we could relate to this book in a way we didn't with the other books we were force fed. Not so much. Throughout that unit, I grew more and more disenchanted with Holden Caulfield. I know some think he's a folk hero of sorts, but i just found him to be a petulant, whiny, rich brat. That is my enduring memory of the novel. "
604,Khoa,"My English teacher warned me, ""One of the books that you either love it or hate it"". I honestly hated this book. Ask any of my friends and they will tell you how much I hated this book. The writing was not strong enough, the characters were very irritating and I wish I could just have punch Holden in the face (and I am known as the calm and collected person in my group of friends). There were so many lines that were repeated and it was just lacking plot. The book was such a slow read and it took me ages to finish it. I know some really enjoyed this book and I appreciate the fact that this was just one of those books that was easy to do an essay on. That being said, I will never read this book again. "
605,Terric853,"I began to re-read this a year ago because I remember loving it in college. As an adult, I hated it! The writing is not great. Holden is a whiny, self-absorbed jerk and I saw nothing about him to warrant me finishing the book, so I put it down half-way through."
606,Lisa Isabella,My least favorite book. Ever. 
607,Noelle Walsh,"Oh, was this book torture to try and read! I had to read this in high school and I thought it was terrible then and I still think it now. I came across a copy recently and it made me remember how much I hated this book, especially after reading a few pages. I wouldn't recommend this book. Use it for a fire or as emergency toilet paper instead."
608,Tyson Adams,"I've tried to like this book, I really have. Yet every time I have read it I've still found myself not seeing what was so good about this."
609,Abd El-Rahman El-Naggar,"I think I was a better person before I red this book. This is not even a book to read, it's a book to survive! Ugh, I felt like I just finished The complete idiot's guide to being a phony bastard without feeling bad about it!Now that I went through that horrible reading experience, I really don't wanna live on a planet where this book is taken seriously, and Holden Caulfield is being shoved up our asses as an icon of rebellion. No, people, this is not rebellion. Rebellion involves, and is all about, taking actions. Complaining all the time doesn't make you a rebel. It makes you a loser. From where I stand, it's no less than a crime to tell teens, or even adults, that it's okay to have no life as long as one blames it on others. I am aware that it's ""not cool"" to show disrespect to Holden Caulfield 'cause he is young and angry and no one understands him and all this kind of crap (Let's admit it, J. D. Salinger surrounded his character with strong immunity from criticism) but Holden Caulfield is a monster. A hundred year old whore trapped in a teen's body. I failed to think otherwise. He sounded more like The Wicked Witch of the West than a school kid who likes chess and worries about the ducks in the lagoon at Central Park. Holden Caulfield would be considered a Nazi or simply go unnoticed if this was a sane world.Holden Caulfield hates things. That's what he does. From cover to cover. I have nothing against hating things. But bitch please! You can't just continue doing it all the time! Not in a novel anyway! Okay, I don't blame Holden Caulfield for hating the world. The world can be a very sick place sometimes. No one would like to argue about that. But you just shouldn't stop there, or else you become a part of the problem. Move! Make some noise! The home of rebels lies BEYOND the point where you only hate the world.Say that you think Holden Caulfield is a fuckin' Zombie, which he really is, and people will give you that coming-from-Mars look, and you will be spoken to in a way that suggests that you have no idea how it feels to be a teen.Like you have never been one before!This novel, nonetheless, is not about being a teen. No. It's just about ugliness. Holden Caulfield is too freakin' interested in ugly things. He chases them all the time. First, it's his ugly friends, then come ugly whores, then ugly gays, then ugly hotels, ugly bars, ugly music, ugly taxis.. you can go on and on until you run out of vocabulary. When Holden Caulfield reaches an ugly thing, he starts bitching about it for like eternity, before he only moves to another ugly thing. I'd faithfully feel sorry for Caulfield if it were other people who threw ugly things in his direction. But fact is HE goes for ugliness on his own behalf. With enormous enthusiasm, he is ready to take shit from everyone he meets just to end up in an ugly situation. This is not human. If there was some kick-ass ugliness in Tokyo, J. D. Salinger would take us there!Only the devil knows what this book would have made out of me if I had read it in my teens. ""The Catcher in the Rye"" is very misleading. If you have to read it, please make sure you don't mistake J. D. Salinger's issues for teenage angst or anything! This book will make you think things about teens which are not true.People who find J. D. Salinger inspiring must not have a serious conversation with or about teens.. let alone children. It's sad and scary how more and more adults take part in that ""let's make it harder for our teens"" campaign.. like it doesn't have enough bastards running it already.The only good thing about this book is Phoebe, Holden's sister. She is amazing. She is cute and wise. She asks Holden if there is anything in life that he actually loves. If J. D. Salinger wasn't full of shit, he would make her the main character.I say J. D. Salinger is full of shit 'cause during his life he always acted like he was suffering from some kind of ""unwanted attention"". I don't mean to be mean but I believe he was actually begging for it. This novel is how J. D. Salinger says that he doesn't give a damn. Alright, I'd think so, I'd REALLY think so, only if he didn't spend half of his life suing people.Plus, you don't bother writing a novel to say that you don't give a damn. You just don't do that.If J. D. Salinger was alive, I'd want to punch him in the face for talking all this shit. "
610,Dan Saniski,"This book is terribly lame in its rebellion compared to the works by, say, the beats. I don't understand what all the is fuss is about"
611,Eleanor,"So much hype about this book being ""amazing"" and ""life-changing""...well apparently if you're a teenager and can relate to Holden. But I can't. What's wrong with me...why do I positively loathe it? I didn't find anything enjoyable in it but was determined to trawl through it and make it to the end amid the continuous cursing, feelings of depression and general hatred of the world. I can understand how some people would find it important in their lives and how it could be relatable. But for me? No. I won't be reading it again."
612,Laurie,"BLAH!! this book gave me a headach. I just could get into it he is just all over the place and there is no point but to make Holden sound crazy, and now I feel annoyed and a little crazy just from reading it."
613,Bekah,I really didn't like this book. I feel like it had no plot line and by the end of the book I really just wanted to scream because Holden was making me so mad. 
614,Reem Deeb,"I actually like books about troubled minds, but this book writing style was just bad and very ""slang"". And the story was incomplete without keeping you thinking of what could happen. "
615,Theresia,"this review might get me shot- but i really didn't like this book even though it's a classic. i guess i just couldn't relate to it, even though i was actually at that age- it was assigned reading before my junior year of high school. i'm not much of a cynic now, and i think i was even less of a cynic then. i should probably reread it since i read it so long ago, but i don't think i can be buggered. "
616,Alejandro Barbosa,"Aside from Phoebe and Mr. Antolini I despised this book and am beyond happy that I have now finished it. If other people enjoy it I'm not the type to argue with their opinions but there is no doubt that I would never recommend this book to anybody. If I could have a superpower it would currently be the ability to climb inside a book and destroy the main character, or at least make it so he is no longer the protagonist."
617,Rochelle Hartson,"So...I know this is a supposed classic and it sooo great and blah blah blah pffft. But, I hated it. I don't know if it's because I didn't read it in high school like everyone else but read it later in life when I just wanted this whiny spoiled rich kid to shutttt upppppp. I also didn't care for the writing style - some my call it simple prose, I call it crap that my cat could write (and probably would. My cat has a similar sense of entitlement to that of Holden Caulfiend - oops, I mean Caulfield) Now, I try not to let this influence my opinion of J.D. salinger's other celebrated work as I have not yet read anything else by him and I hear Frannie and Zooey is amazing. So, yeah, there you have it. Didn't like Catcher in the Rye, so sue me."
618,nunya,"I read this book 4 years ago as a high school student. It is the literary equivalent to Reality Bites. I had read it in 4 days. It is nothing but 200+ pages of the main character whining. If this book were a roller coaster it would be a completely straight flat track. If this book were hooked up to a heart monitor, it would flatline immediately. It has no arc whatsoever and as a result nothing happens to make us care for the character. I will never read this book again."
619,Gayle,"Language and situations that made me uncomfortable as a young teenager; but it's one of those situations where if something is denigrated or banned, even the most virtuous teenager has a desire to peek inside. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
620,Vyou," book confused me a lot. I didn't really understand which was the authour intention about this book. The main character is such an hipócrit kid, that is afraid to Grow up."
621,Julie O'connell,"I thought the book was dated and horrible. I give it one star for sentimental reasons only. Seriously, the only book I've wanted to throw against the wall in a long, long time."
622,Soraia Ferreira,"I really enjoyed this book. I like the way it's written, but it's weird in a way because there's no plot. He just tells you stuff and that's it. So you're just like ""is he telling this for a reason or...?"". Anyways, I really enjoyed myself reading it and it's considered a classic so I'm quite happy about it."
623,Katrina,"***SPOILERS***PROFANITY USED***SPOILERS***I've just finished reading this so called ""classic"" and now I'm a fucking goddamn phony. Sorry, swearing has been infused into my fucking mind, goddamn it! Don't let anyone tell you this goddamn piece of shit is a literary masterpiece, because they'd be a fucking phony. Fucking bastards!This book was pointless and a total waste of my time. I don't normally do this, but I will continue this review with the words Salinger used so often, which drove me 'fucking' insane. Oh, let's just use the word goddamn about a thousands time, right along with Jesus Christ, God's sake, damn and sonovabitch. Yes, these words and more, throughout the entire book! Nothing moved the story forward and everyone annoyed Holden to the point where they just 'killed' him or he wanted to puke. He thought everything and everyone was a phony and he was depressed ALL the fucking time and he said it. He addressed people as old Phoebe (his young sister), old Jane, old Sally, etc. and to beat all, Holden, the main character was only sixteen years old. Yes, sixteen! This is meant to be a young adult book! What the fuck! I recently found out a high school teacher had suggested this book to our seventeen year old daughter to read. Really? Why? What publishing company thought this would be something to help guide teenagers? Honestly, I think the only reason it turned out to be a classic, is because it was the only piece of crap that didn't get burned and lasted through decades. Ohhh, did you read that book? You know, the one with all the swearing, talking about sex, phonies, smoking cigarettes and drinking. If this book was submitted to a publishing house today...it would've been rejected. At least I hope they would've rejected this piece of crap! I'm not so sure now. And what about the goddamn publishers acting like this fucking piece of shit is a classic? They make everyone feel like phony bastards because they haven't read a ""classic"", just so they could sell more shit like this! If my review doesn't make any sense and all you're reading are the goddamn curse words, well, that sums up this book. Don't fucking read this book. If you want to read it to say, ""Oh, yes I've read that book, it's a GREAT classic"" you'll just be a goddamn phony. I want my goddamn money back from those fucking publishers who say this is a fucking piece of literature. Sonovabitches! This book should be burned!"
624,Abby,I really didn't like this book. I just feel like the whole book its just holden whining and doing extremely stupid stuff. I mean I can see how people might relate to it but I just don't see the connection.
625,Conrad Murphy,The Catcher in the Rye wasn't really about anything at all. Holden Caufield was always negative and never had something nice to say about anything. It was boring and I got tired of Holden's rude tone very fast. He was very depressing and complained way too much. His terrible narration made me fall asleep several times while I was reading.
626,Ladiibbug,"Read pre-G/RHated it! Whine, whine, whine. Yech."
627,George,Maybe I just didn't 'get' this bookThe anticipation in this book is a bit overwhelming at times but just fades away My expectations were a lot higher than what was delivered
628,Kevin,"The best event in the storyline was early on when our ""hero"" got punched in the mouth by his roommate.That's it! Waste of time to read."
629,Tatiana,"I liked the book at the beginning, thought it interesting in the middle, was quite annoied closer to the end, gave up eventually. "
630,Braden Shafer,"I did not personally enjoy it. It was excruciating to read, due to Holden's constant negativity and complaining. "
631,Camden Brannon,The catcher in the rye was an interesting book but I did not like the main character holden. holden would complain about everything and then do that dame thing. I did not like this book
632,Book Him Danno,"Hated this book, I couldn't stand the whole coming of age theme. Maybe if I were male I would feel differently, but this book sucks. Classic my foot."
633,Stellawhite,"Yo quería que me gustara este libro, pero lamentablemente lo odie. Se puede decir que esta es la novela más deprimente que he leído en mi vida. No hubo ni un personaje que me gustara y nunca me llegué a identificar con el protagonista y su visión de la vida. Realmente quedé muy decepcionada con la lectura, pues esperaba más de un clásico como este. "
634,Abcdarian,"After recently re-reading Lord of the Flies and enjoying it much more than when I read it back in school, I thought I'd see if Catcher in the Rye improved upon re-reading. It didn't. I will never understand how this gets to the top of so many great novel lists."
635,VWrulesChick,"argh...I read the book and the whole time I thought he was ""phony"" as he describes others. OK maybe a lunatic, who needs help. I did not connect with the main character and his chitter chatter about people or situations. Not sure why this is considered a classic. "
636,Rick,"Don't ask me why, but I was just thinking about how much I hated this book. What is it about? Borderline personality disorder? Petulance? How manchildren have no sense of humor? Please, why can't I erase this novel from my brain?"
637,Jane,I tried this book when I was 13 and again when I was 25ish. I didn't make it past chapter three either time because I wanted to bludgeon Holden Caulfield with something sharp. Or heavy. Or heavy and sharp. Will not attempt again.
638,Jana,This is SERIOUSLY the worst book I've ever read. I just finished it since it was required reading for English during the summer and it was certainly not thought provoking and seemed to have no lesson behind it. Don't waste your time with this book unless you want to read about a teenager who hates everyone and everything and talks about how lonely and depressed he is all the time. The only time I can ever recall when Holden is happy is at the end when he watches his little sister ride the carrousel.
639,Randa Myers,"This reads like a 3rd grade end of semester English project. I could barely discern a plot from the onslaught of profane hubris & outdated slang. What little storyline I could wrestle out of the tangle of arrogance and disdain wasn't worth the effort. You can argue it hits home with Tweens & teens, but there is much better angst lit out there. This book is a severe case of Emperor's New Clothes. When I hear people talk about it, I get the awkward & painful feeling no one actually likes it, they just believe they should, bc it's banned & beloved.I was actually really annoyed when I finished; annoyed I wasted time reading these pages of what amounted to, in my case, much 2nd hand embarrassment.Embarrassment that I have friends who claim to love it, shame that I know adults who pretend this is life changing literature. "
640,Adriana  Hates You,"Holden es el niño de dieciséis años más sexista, pesado y tonto que he podido leer hasta ahora. El autor parece que ha intentado crear un personaje profundo, complicado y genial, pero le ha salido el tiro por la culata. Si por lo menos tuviera una trama interesante...pero es que el libro literalmente no va de nada y se hace más aburrido cada vez que pasas las páginas. Y, joder, ¿a quién no le gusta el cine? "
641,Francis,"Not a good read! Holden, the main character, rambles for 200 pages. I had to skip paragraphs to get back on track. The only reason I can come up with of why this book is well known is because it was banned from schools. Except for some 'soft' cursing, I can't tell you why it was banned. It's not provocative. It's not racey. It's not good! I won't even bother giving it a review because it's not worth it."
642,Melly,"I first read this book when I was 17 or 18 and hated it and didn't understand why this was so hyped. I thought Holden was a horrible little shit and wondered why anyone would admire him and name their children after him. I felt he should have been throttled and given a stern talking to. After studying English Lit. in college, I read it again as an adult and hated it even more. Must you be a rebellious teen to get this? Must you hate your life and your family and the world? I guess I just didn't, don't and never expect my kids to either. I am a lover of many classics and appreciate great writing, but just have to disagree with the literary masses on this one. I know that it is possible to dislike your protagonist and still love the masterpiece - reference Lolita by Nabakov, a perfect example. However, this, to me, was just awful. I didn't appreciate a thing about it except that it finally ended."
643,Me,"This is one of those books that if you don't read at the right time, you won't like it. And that time of course is your whiny, nobody understands me phase, at 15 or 16. Terrible, terrible, terrible."
644,Suzydumeur,"Expérience littéraire détestable... personnage détestable, langage détestable, histoire de vie inutile et sans aucun sens..."
645,Emma,Perhaps I was too old when I first read Catcher to identify with Holden. Perhaps the book has so much hype it could never live up to my expectations. Perhaps it is just not a very good book.
646,Mc,This was not really my kind of book. It came to me highly recommended by two friends but it did not live up to the hype. I found Holden to be quite annoying with the constant complaining. He did not seem to be able to look on the bright side at all preferring to take a pessimistic view on life. Despite my reservations about the main character it did give a good insight into his feelings and provided a snapshot of his life. Overall I don't regret reading this book as it was a bit different to what I usually read but I don't think I would recommend it to someone else.
647,Regina D,I wish I could rate this negative stars. This was the most boring and annoying book I have ever read. I would love to have a discussion with someone who enjoyed this book so they can tell me what they got from it that I clearly missed.
648,Mo,"Forced to read it in summer school, barely could contain my yawning every 2 minutes, always wishes I could go ride a merry-go-round instead of wasting the hours it took to read this thing. Can't stand depressed characters - sucks the air/life out of the room.On this I guess I will differ with many others who love this book, but I don't think in our modern era this book would be worth all the press or accolades. The pace is obviously slow, but I just can't empathize with Holden and for the love of me can't figure out why anyone else would. Then again, I believe we are all masters of our own destiny to a certain point and our outcomes reflect our desire to face the world head on. Moreover, growing up with parent who were poor as children, I was not exactly spoiled and learned first hand that nothing is given. So I can't figure out why Holden can't stop, think about what he wants, and move on towards it come hell or high water - if you are going to die, you may as well go out fighting."
649,Heather McDougall,I had to read it for a class. I read (suffered) through it in highschool and I did not enjoy it. All these years later my opinion still has not changed. I could not get past the language and bad attitude.
650,Olkhazar,"Книга про вечно обиженного и раздраженного подростка, с элементами психоанализа и всякой такой дури. Не понимаю, почему книга оказалась в бестселлерах и т.д. и т.п. Кто-нибудь может объяснить в чем суть ""интеллектуального бестселлера"", ""культового классика современности""? Я так ничего и не понял. Может суть сводится к ""потерянному поколению"", к тому, как бессмысленна жизнь сегодняшнего подростка, и т.д.? Не знаю.Да, конечно, ""нет книги без какой-то пользы"", и две три цитаты из книги можно отнести к этому разряду, наподобие той, в которой говорится о зрелом и незрелом человеке и т.д.В общем, пока никому не советую впустую тратить время. "
651,O,"I honestly don't know where to begin with this mess of a novel. It was repetitive and boring. The main character had his head up his own ass through this entire book, which is not surprising since he is a teenager. I know that I was supposed to probably sit around afterwards and discuss how profound I found everything. I instead rolled my eyes and just dismissed the book as soon as I finished with it. This is a coming of age story of Holden Caulfield. After being told that he will be expelled because of his lack of work at his private school, Holden goes to New York City so that he can have some time to break it to his parents he has been booted from another school.Holden is lazy and critical of everyone around him. Heck there were several profound comments that he made about pimply guys and ugly girls that just made him sound like such an awesome person to be around, one wonders why he has no close friends.I think that J.D. Salinger was definitely going for something here I think to speak about how so many teens feel alienated from the world and people around them. But I didn't get the sense that Holden was alienated, just bored with everyone because he held everyone except for his sister, and his two brothers in total disdain. The writing was not great. It was repetitive to the point that I was able to totally call what Holden was going to say. I never want to hear the words ""They really can"" ever again.That's the thing about girls.Every time they do something pretty, even if they're not much to look at, or even if they're sort of stupid, you fall in love with them, and then you never know where the hell you are.Girls.Jesus Christ.They can drive you crazy.They really canYou poor thing. Falling in love with a girl that is not attractive and dumb. And yet they still don't want you. Almost every time somebody gives me a present, it ends up making me sad.So profound. I mean I hardly rolled my eyes that hard after I read this. The flow was also pretty awful. I think it was because the story just went on and on and on to the point I was rooting for a bad end for Holden. Can you tell that I couldn't stand this character?The setting of New York honestly didn't feel real at all. Maybe because Holden was so far up his own butt, the only thing that gets described are other people (specifically girls/women) and how attractive they are or in the case of this book, how ugly he finds them. The ending I think was supposed to make me think. It just once again made me roll my eyes hard. What can one say about a character that I don't think matures at all, and still sees the problems with everyone and not himself. "
652,Jay al gharabally,"couldn't even get through 4 chapters. the writing was horrible. too repetitive and just...stupid. he literally says ""and all"" after every sentence. "
653,Emmy," This book was very well written but holy god it was boring. I didn't like Holden as a character he was too whinny, all he did was complain about everybody and he most I what he said was a massive contradiction. Because of this I made it very hard to read and even enjoy this book. "
654,Alyssa,"Narrator was whiny as hell, I fail to see why this book is considered a ""must read"" classic."
655,Saul,"I read this book when I was in High School and re-read it when I was older and I had the same feeling. What was Holden's problem? I just could not sympathize with the man character. Maybe it was my upbringing, my social economic status or my latin culture. Or maybe this character is just crazy and I can not groc his plight."
656,Ry Dae,"Catcher in the Rye by J. D. Salinger is a classic American novel about a teenage boy, Holden, who has serious issues. The setting takes place in Agerstown, PA and Manhattan, NY during the 1950’s. After growing tired of his peers in his boarding school, he decides to leave three days earlier than when he is supposed because of his expulsion. When he gets in New York he gets himself a hotel room so his parents will not know that he got expelled and ran away. While in New York, Holden just hangs out with numerous females and old friends. He shows up at his parents’ house and surprises his sister Phoebe. He tells her that he will hitchhike to the west. She wants to go with him but he doesn’t let her. He hangs out with his sister and then the narrative ends. Holden then reveals that he became sick and plans to start at a new school and “apply himself”.I did not like this book. It was boring. I really do not understand why it is labeled as classic American literature. The only part that was half-interesting was when Holden was still at Pencey. When he got to New York he did the same thing over and over again and it felt like each chapter was the same.I would recommend Catcher in the Rye only because its classic American literature. "
657,Alesia Barbaro,I had never read this in school so thought I'd check it out. I read only half the book and didn't get why this was a must read. I thought it was a very boring book that was NOT holding my interest at all. Personally I would not have enjoyed this book when I was in high school either.
658,τλιϓλ,لم أستطع الإنسجام معها مطلقا ولا مع ثلاثة أرباع الألفاظ السوقية والكلمات البذيئة التي تزخر بها.
659,Qhlueme,"I read it in high school (shortly after the First Crusade), because it was one of those books that were lasciviously chuckle-worthy. I read it, but I did not like it. I especially disliked the swearing and smoking. I didn't recognize it well at the time, but the hopelessness was also discomforting. Salinger is a recognized author, so an informal, unprofessional criticism of any work of his, such as this critique is, can be expected to be easily dismissed. That's okay. One man's meat is another man's poison. The story reflected teenage thinking and feelings. Speaking for myself, I would prefer such a story to conclude with either a ""happily ever after,"" or concrete ideas of how to deal positively with the challenges and disappointments encountered during one's teen years."
660,Meredith Walker,"Supposedly this is one of the most beloved and enduring words in world literature. Hence, with high hopes, I thought I should give this apparently classic novel a read. Yet I was disappointed. In fact, I think it is one of the worst books I have ever read. For starters, there is no plot. The book is just a haphazard collection of stories that are mostly insignificant and confusing. I kept waiting and waiting for something to happen, but it never did. Holden Caulfield narrates the of a couple of days in his 16 year old life in a manner that has made his character synonymous with the cynical adolescent. After a while, I got tired of the slang and the way Holden implored the reader to have sympathy for him. He just kept wandering and doing the same thing over and over, becoming increasingly irritating with his constant use of stupid phrases. And it is unnecessarily repetitive. His expression is monosyllabic and lacking in precision of description and imagery. Surely not everyone is a phoney. This is overrated, repetitive, whiny and self-indulgent with little imagination. There is no point to it at all, except for this kid to prove what a rich brat he is, whine and smart off to people he doesn't even like although he insists on hanging around with them, and brag constantly about virtues he doesn't have, making him one of the biggest hypocrites and phonies of them all. "
661,Lauren Hanley,"Couldn't finish it. I read up on the cliff notes of it, and see how the metaphors the characters present could be interesting to learn about in an English literature class setting, but just reading for fun - nope."
662,Drew Tuá,"I hated it! I tought I would like it at least a little, but no, at all.The story is just stupid and the main character is so asijalsf arg he's such an asshole, he makes me so nervous oh my god, you don't even know."
663,Amogha,"You know I am supposed to like it  and all  but, seriously it gave me a headache  and all . I can't even write a  phony review for Crissake"
664,Butcakes,"if i was competely honest about this book, my comment too would be banned...this is a terrible book and, where most books are written to educate, this book uneducates...don't read it. its not worth the several hours it'll take you to read. it's really not."
665,Tobias Roeloffs,"I was assigned this book in 11th grade, the high point of most kids' angst. I don't know if I couldn't relate to Holden or if the writing was what got me (it felt like every other sentence started with ""It kills me when...""), but I did not enjoy this book at all. If there was such a thing as a zero, that's what I'd give. I'm aware I'm being harsh, but keep in mind these reviews are subjective (meaning you don't have to agree with me and its perfectly fine if you don't), and plenty of my class mates at the time did like it a lot."
666,Ariel,No.
667,Andrea Elizabeth,Hated it. The main character annoyed me to no end. This book is often a love or hate book; there's rarely an in-between. 
668,Katie Verhaeren,"You either love this book or hate it. I hate it. Have had to read it multiple times for class, have never once finished it."
669,Joey Smith,"Mai libro fu più sopravvalutato, irritante, indisponente ""e compagnia bella"".Sia chiaro, io sono per le seconde chances, sono un uomo di cuore: dai libri, agli album, ai film, persino alle ragazze:) chi non merita una seconda chance?Il punto è che mai nessuno, prima del sr. Caulfield, era riuscito a mettere talmente a dura prova la mia pazienza da indurmi a ridurre in brandelli un libro. Dargli una seconda chance? ma per l'amor di Dio!ASTIO."
670,Neil Mudde,"Read this for a course I took in English, not too sure if it improved my English Language Skill, pretty shocking when it cam out, in fact there are still libraries which will not carry this on their shelves"
671,Joni,"I'm clearly not in tune with the standards used to judge classic literature, because I couldn't find any redeeming qualities at all about this book. Bad language, incoherent thought lines, almost no plot, and very little purpose at all as far as I can tell. The only redeeming thing about this book is the knowledge that an adult managed to so accurately portray the mindset of an immature adolescent, and apparently that fact is ardently adored by many. This may be the first book ever that I just wish I had never read, since it gave me neither instruction, education, inspiration, nor even entertainment."
672,Anaïs,"I hated this book, it was way too descriptive for me. I didn't understand the point of the story/ what the author tried to express. I might go back to it later maybe I'll understand."
673,Emma LeBlanc,Why is this book hyped up so much? One of the most boring books I've ever read. Does it even have a plot? Not even close.
674,Jemima,boring
675,Carmen Cox,"Okay, I'll be honest. I didn't finish it. I couldn't - it just rambled on and on and on and didn't go anywhere! I got about 2/3 of the way, and decided I really didn't care how it ended."
676,Haifa Fakhro,هذا الكتاب عباره عن سخافات لا نهايه لها من الصفحه الاولى. لا اعلم سبب الضجه حول هذه الروايه فهي لا تحتوي على مضمون ادبي او حتى احداث شيقه، و هولدن كولفيد من اسواء الشخصيات التي قد يخترعها كاتب. كنت اتوقع ان اقراء عملاً استثنائي ولكن للاسف الروايه ليست عاديه بل سيئه!
677,Tammy,"I don't get what all the hype was about. I didn't like it much at all...I found Caulfield so boring and I did not like the writing style either. It seemed like the book was written by a kid, and not an interesting one."
678,Pete,"One of my top 5 most boring, self indulgent, over hyped books. Read it twice (Started & stopped 3 times) just to make sure I wasn't missing something &, sadly, I wasn't. Even dropped one star after re-reading.I'm sure others will find it wonderful but definitely not for me."
679,Jaclyn,This was my book club's book of the month; the girl who picked it said it was her favorite book of all time. I have no idea why. It's just a couple of days in the life of a depressed and troubled teenage boy with a swearing problem. I don't get the hype or the controversy and I didn't enjoy it. Blah. 
680,Katharina Mackenzie Jakobsen,"In the beginning I was taken with the book, mostly because it was hard to believe it was written in 1951; it seemed very contemporary. But when Holden is around his baby sister the book gives me the creeps. The sister-brother relationship or rather the brother's way of ""rating"" his kid sister's body seemed to be written by a man with a serious problem regarding little girls. Researching J.D. Salinger I found just that. Even if I could separate a writer and his work (I can't), the book was rather forgettable."
681,Iris,"I like the stream of thought narrative, but I expected so much more. I was bored half way through it, and struggled through until the end. I had heard so much controversy about the book, but I don't understand what the fuss is about. "
682,Ben,I read this book because of MEl Gibson's facination with it in The Conspiracy Theory.I've never felt so let down. I'm sure there are literary merits to this unkempt story of teen angst. But I was rather bored by what amounted to a book version of MTV's the Real World.
683,Naeemah,"i'm not an action junkie, but i waited for something to happen. Nothing did! i know i'm in the minority, but i did not like this book."
684,Bec,"In my overwhelming love for classic literature, or just ordinary literature, I am not often disappointed by the constant recommendations or feeling of ""this is a _Must_ _read_ book"". But, there's a first time for everything.Ordinarily I can read quite fast, especially if I'm very interested in the plot or a particular character or the writer's tone is addictive or stylistically interesting.Catcher in the Rye has none of those elements. I felt for Holden for some time, I really did, but there's only so much 16-y.o.-white boy-rich kid-privilege I can listen to, and 200 pages is too long for it. On top of that, noticing at first the shortness of the book, I figured it would be easy to get through. 3 weeks and focusing on Every. Single. Word. in an attempt to find the plot, was not what I signed up for. I asked Scott, who has read it before, what the point of this was meant to be. I understand I'm reading it too late not only in the timeline of my life (just on the cusp of teenage-dom though, so not so bad), and the timeline of Earth - so the style of blithering truth from the mouth of a loud teenager has been done to death, and this was sort of the first. (Yes, that wasn't worded well, no I don't care). That being said, this book should have a warning label on the front: ""Caution! If you are looking for plot, you will not find it here!"". Unless it was published instead as a small pamphlet that just said ""The Catcher in the Rye, by JD Salinger.Holden thinks everyone is a phony, but in truth, he is the real phony, and he won't stop whinging.The End."" "
685,Pankaj Pandey,"I am probably at the peak of frustration after finishing this book and the frustration rose exponentially. There are a hell lot of reasons for that but before I begin actually writing review, lemme give my fellow readers a word of advice. There were basically 3 reasons for me to choose this book and all 3 reasons consequently taught me lessons. The first reason why I picked up this book was because I got it for FREE. And now i know why few things in the world are free. It's not because they are worthless n all... Its because they belong to dustbin and no one ever put a price tag in a bin. The second reason for me to choose this book out of a bunch of 'FREE ebooks was that I read somewhere that this book was banned. Now I realise sometimes government too think in public interest. Last and the least reason for choosing this' pain in the a**, Goodreads's good readers have rated this book on an average of 3.5+....This led me to an assumption that it must have had something different. But I ended up realising that those giving this book a high ratings also fall in the same category as the character in the story, which i am gonna describe. Well, let's begin ""catcher in the rye"". The story revolves around few days a guy spent after being expelled from school. This guy Holden is such a negative soul that in complete book he never met anybody whom he liked... For him everybody is phony. He always introduces his readers to new character with repeated usage of word ""phony"" and quite frequently sunnova bitch. He had never achieved anything in his life because.... Well because he is a crook. He never stays at any school for long and never have respect for learning. He hates his teachers at every school because they looked like ""phony"" to him. He couldn't complete his schooling, he couldn't pass his test, he couldn't beat or even face a guy, he could even talk to a person without hating him.... And this goes on... This story ends quite abruptly. Another reason for my hatred. Overall this story is a complete negative for a teenager... Hate it.. I wouldn't have even cared to complete this book (rating this book is of no question), had this book had some good words for me to learn so that i may improve my vocab."
686,Rebekka,"This book is supposed to be one of the greatest ""coming of age"" stories available to us, however, I found it...well, boring to say the very least. I kept expecting something, ANYTHING, to happen but nothing ever did. It may be that I have different taste than the ""average American"" reader, but when I pick up a book, I want it to stimulate me. I want to be able to connect with the characters and feel what they are going through. This book, in my opinion, was just an epic failure. I don't see why it's tauted as been such a great story. Sorry folks!"
687,A Taylor,"I was, overall, severely annoyed with the main character of Holden. I see that his intentions are good, but just seems like a bit of a douche. I didn't find any way of relating to the character at all. "
688,Jimmy,"The main character is THE most annoying character I've ever encountered. I didn't like him at the start and the constant whining made me really hate him! I wanted to finish the book, but I actually regret it..."
689,Ashy,tried reading this in my teens with high expectation - could not get into it and found it very uninteresting - have not tried again - but reading other reviews here i think my initial instinct was right!
690,Jake Hawken,"If I had read this as a 13 year old, I probably would have loved it. But I didn't. I read it as a 21 year old, and I absolutely hated it."
691,Danae,"The first time I read one of the most seminal works of American fiction of the 20th century I was not impressed. Holden is a highly unsympathetic character who bored me. I tried to read it again, 5 years later, and was similarly disappointed. Clearly, I'm missing something?"
692,Boo Boo,I couldn't finish this book. 
693,Shee Tsim Nam,a lost child lacking guidance letting opportunities (including getting more knowledge) flow away having difficulty with too much time to kill ending up having to waste it. may be i am too old to be in the mood to 'enjoy' this sort of stuff. find it very boring. 
694,Phylicia,I read this in class. The only thing I remember is there was a hooker in the room and the kid had no idea what to do with her.
695,Jenn,"Nothing happens. At all. The main character whines his way through the book, complaining about everyone else and is completely noncritical of himself. He doesn't grow, strengthen himself, or influence anything."
696,Rob,"This is, hands down, the most over-rated book I've ever picked up. Holden Caulfield is a prattling little snot who has no redeeming qualities. The fact that students are subjected to this tripe is an affront to our educational system."
697,Sharon,"Read years ago, but do not particularly want to read again. The kid had a potty mouth............ read it in high school and then again in college. enough is enough. Salinger just died this week."
698,Heather,"I hate this book. I was 20 pages from the end and I couldn't endure the painful, cursing monotony of self pity any longer so I hurled it across the room and never picked it up again. No joke."
699,Ernie,"I was, as one might imagine, shocked to discover that Grease had a love child with Gertrude Stein. As I read the last sentences, I had this terrible feeling wash over me as if I just realized, after the fact, I paid someone $10 to cough on me for three hours. ""Don't tell anybody anything. If you do, you start missing everybody"" is not, and never will be, the conclusion to anything worthy of being called an American classic. It does, however, stand a much better chance at becoming the facebook status of a plastered sorority girl."
700,Stephany,"I could not stand Holden, I don't like the word phoney and I didn't think this was a relatable coming of age story. Why do they make teenagers read this?"
701,Edmund,"I found this book rather boring and uneventful. The storyline was really dull and I didn't enjoy a single chapter in the entire book. Holden Caulfield is a seriously troubled character who clearly has problems with everything and everyone. The language is very poor and very unenjoyable to read. This embarrassment of a book is definitely making itself a rival of one of the worst books I've ever read. It was dull, unengaging and had one of the worst character developments in history. It provided no entertainment, no enjoyment, not even a hint of amusement. Caulfield is the biggest phony on the planet and tries to excuse himself by blaming every other individual. The storyline was quite terrible. Simply put, a teenager flunked school because he was too lazy or bored, then ran away from school and joyrided around, staying in hotels and even ordered a prostitute before turning her down as soon as she entered the room, then visits his sister and then the book ends. I found no climax in this book, not even a whiff. Holden Caulfield, the narrator, is the biggest factor that contributes to my extensive loathing of this book. He uses nothing but the same phrases over and over again and it makes him sound like an idiot. There is also no character development that I could see. The Holden Caulfied that we were presented to at the beginning of the book is the exact same person at the end of the book. The fact that there was absolutely no point in reading about his character development makes me feel that I wasted so much of my time on this. This book is one of the most insufferable and tedious books I've ever had the misfortune of reading and I hope that no one else must endure the same mental torture that I did. "
702,Sera Hall,"Overrated, simplified glimpse at the life of a twat kid. Not worthy of obsession, barely worthy of trees destroyed to make paper it has been printed on, to be subsequently jammed down the collective throats of the misunderstood teens for nearly six decades. Fuck you, Holden caufield. You aren't worth a one hundredth of the depth ascribed to you. Pure rot."
703,Dayna,"Okay. I hate this book. Holden is a pain in the neck. The only reason I gave it one star was because of some of the parts that weren't terrible (his brother, that one kid who jumped out the window). The worst part is, I'm supposed to relate with this jerk. He's misunderstood, he is deep! No, he's immature, mean to those who care about him, and somehow manages to be a narcissist. He thinks everyone is a phony, pretending and fake. Guess what? I'm not a phony. I'm not pretending to like this book. You suck, Holden."
704,Ed ,"The main character in Catcher -Holden- is the complete embodiment of all the phonies he adamantly hates. In a book like this, you can have it two ways: Either the 'hero' is a jerk and he gets what he deserves, OR you grow enamored with him and want the best for him. Neither scenario happened in Catcher in the Rye. In my personal experience, there are two types of people who like this book (everyone else doesn’t): ONE is the high-brow beatnik wannabes who use it as a condescending tool to speak down to those who actually enjoy good books (often doing so with vague references to other classic writers while engagin in drawn-out descriptions of the mundane details in Catcher) and TWO, people that have read maybe 6 books in their life (if that!) and bask in the mystique and the resulting nobility that goes along with claiming that this literary failure is their ""favorite""... Salinger hated the type of attention this book received and dismissed the whole thing as a dragged out fad, never quite recovering from it personally, despite forever trying and seemingly apologizing for it, till the end... It's as though Salinger himself felt as a phonie for having written this book, and having used the type of bait-and-switch that made it popular. I hope the irony is not lost in the fact that the book mostly appeals to those who are total phonies (phonies being the focal point of this book). Due to my love of nearly all “classics”, I persistently read this book several times in order to “get it” (at different ages, including at Holden’s age over two decades ago and lastly in 2010). Considering all this and the fact that even the name of the book is a letdown of a joke, my reaction was always the same thing you get from a bad mislabeled YouTube video: “I want my time I spent on this thing back”… This book is all about its mesmerizing title and the self-feeding hype. At least we can seek some comfort that our generation (gen x and younger) was force-fed this thing, as opposed to falling for the original bait, like the boomers or older gens did..."
705,Jolien,"I read this book having high expectations but I didn't like it that much. I hated the main charachter, he hated everything and everyone. I didn't learn anyting. What's the moral? I hoped that the ending would be more exciting but it wasn't, at all. I wouldn't say this is a must read or a classic."
706,Basha1971,It was a long time ago that I read this book. I read it because it seemed to be on everyone's list of favourite books. It was a chore to finish it. I barely remember it but I do remember hating it.
707,Hussah,"Before I start, the rating I gave was not based on its literally content, it was based on 1= I didn't like the book - 5= It was amazing! And I didn't like it at all.First reason is that there was no main plot and it was just a series of random events.Second is that the main character, Holden, is annoying and irritating. I know that he is supposed to represent us and that Holden is inside everyone of us and all that, but no; he is a drag, and a miserable twat who thinks everyone's a phoney. I happen to not care enough what anyone is doing no matter how phoney it is as long as I'm out of it. Third is the metaphors, which the book was mainly about. I get metaphors and everything, I just found them extremely boring and too deep in this book, though I really, really liked the red hunting hat one. There is an amount of undertone to which there is no point of writing because almost no one will understand, which sort of defeats the purpose, really, unless the purpose was getting attention. Fourth reason which I think is a huge factor in liking the book is the timing. I read this and I'm 20, and I have noticed that everyone I know who liked the book or remember liking it are confused teens like Holden, or are in their late twenties and early thirties and are back to the point of asking about the purpose of their existence, which a lot of people their age seem to experience. I'm at the point where I'm done with questioning life and just making the best out of it and accepting my chronic confusion. The last note I have on this book is that I was too critical of it as a novel -which I know now that the book wasn't written to represent it as much as a template to the metaphors - I thought that the writer was too lazy to even write about a somewhat articulate character and sequenced events. And I had every right to be critical because on the cover there it was: ""A novel by J.D. Salinger"" and I was disappointed. The cover shouldn't have said ""novel"", it should've been: ""A fictional diary by J.D. Salinger"" and I wouldn't have been critical about it . I might've even liked it. "
708,Travis Griffin,Why did I read this? It sucked.
709,DrgnLady,"""Who wants flowers when you're dead?""   That quote is the only good thing about The Catcher in the Rye.   This book sucks so bad I don't understand why they have kids read it in school."
710,Donmeko Roberts,I didnt really like the book. What i like about the book is that Holden is crazy and dont care about anything. He was a boy that hated school and cussed a lot.
711,Annie,I was force to read this book....ugh....I rather never again lol sorry but I could not stand Holden complaining all the time
712,Oliver Baisely,"I was made to read this book at school. I didn't see much point to it then, and I still don't. Perhaps if a book seems this obtruse, people will imagine it is concealing some deep, hidden, important meaning."
713,Aoife,Un eventful throughout the novel and very difficult to read due to this if you do not relate to Holden cawfield. I was made read this book for school and have to know it thoroughly and even that could not give me the motivation to read it! It's like marmite you either love it or hate it it's one or the other there is no in between. And for me I hated it
714,Enna Isilee (Squeaky Books),"I can't read this book, even if it is for a class. It goes against all of my standards and the language is AWFUL."
715,Yvonnda Trimble,I did't like the book. I didnt like the book because it didn't catch my attention like I wanted it to. It's something I wouldn't read just because. Honestly i only read the book because i had to read it. Thats what i think about this book.
716,Rachel Kenyon,"Some interesting facts about 
  J.D. Salinger's
""The Catcher in the Rye""
:
Mark David Chapman, the man who shot John Lennon, was reading a copy of 
  ""The Catcher in the Rye""
 when he was arrested. He said in his police statement that the larger part of his personality was 
  Holden Caulfied
, while the smaller part of his personality was Satan.Police found a copy of the novel in John Hinckley Jr's apartment after he shot Ronald Reagan in 1981. Hinckley said he shot Reagan to impress actress Jodie Foster, whom he'd been stalking.In 1989, Robert John Bardo stalked and murdered actress Rebecca Schaeffer at her home. He was carrying a copy of the book when he was arrested.That is the only interesting thing about this book. Apparently murderers enjoy it. Should I feel relieved then, that I hate this book with every fiber of my being? From the very first sentence, in the very first chapter I knew how my feelings would be on this book. I will be honest in my review and say that I did not make it past the ninety page mark. I felt that I gave it more then a fair chance. There are too many good books out there to waste your time reading one that you despise. The writing ... was J.D. Salinger even a real author? How did this book get published let alone become a well known classic? The writing was just bloody awful, it made me cringe. I read classics to avoid this kind of writing ... this is like a cruel joke. Let's set aside the writing and focus on the storyline for a minute ... oh wait there isn't one! For the ninety pages that I did read, 
  nothing
 happened. I'm used to slow paced books, but in ninety pages we didn't even get through one crumbly night of Holden's crumbly life (did I mention that the same phrases keep popping up over, and over, and over again!). I dislike Holden very much so. He is perverted and foul mouthed. Maybe he has some redeeming qualities further on in the book but I didn't care enough to find out. All of the characters in this book are as flat as the paper that they were written on. That aside, I couldn't stomach all of the vulgar language and sexual content. For instance, did you know that ""Goddamn"" is used exactly 245 times in this book?This book is not going back on the shelf. I'm going to sell it and use the money to buy a real classic."
717,Jackie,The protagonist is a whiny white male that's coming to sexual awakening. That's all this book is. I knew too many guys like him.
718,Portiaclapham,"Slow paced and frustrating, and a story line that lacks structure or any sense of direction. Seriously, don't waste your time "
719,The Literary Bystander,"I have vague memories of attempting to read this several years ago, and only getting a third into the book before I decided to call it quits. I wanted to know what was it about the book that had captivated so many people, why it had endured for so long and is commonly claimed to 'speak for a voice of a generation' or something like that. But I'm sorry, I just found the book to be 
really, really boring
 and will probably never, ever come back to finish reading it because I just simply didn't care for what's-his-face and his whining. So yeah... that's my relatively unpopular opinion on it?"
720,Martin,"I always imagined Catcher in the Rye to be a seminal work; a must-read. Frankly, I was disappointed. I can only attribute this to being too old and too late to appreciate the impact which the novel must have generated when it was first published in the 1940s. "
721,Cassandra Kay Silva,"This book was terrible. I absolutely hated the character, there was no real plot, the ending was pointless, there was entirely too much swearing. To sum up it was like my teenage years: thank heavens its over."
722,Kirst Yeo,"i had to force myself to keep going with this book, I felt no empathy with Holden and felt it was a bit of a non story not my thing at all"
723,Wes Kilkenny,Why do they even make this part of students syllabus anymore? Because it's basically tradition? There's an ass ton of books better than this one. Something any English teacher with half a brain that isn't just trying to get a paycheck will tell you. Poorly written. Worse story. It's time to move on and evolve our societies standards of educational prose.
724,Tirthankar Chakraborty,"A mediocre story about a mediocre, whiny, entitled prick leading and heading towards a mediocre existence in a dreary, and, once again, mediocre, setting. Throughout the read, I kept hoping and praying for something to happen to rescue me from this perpetual cycle of tediousness that was this entire story. I don't understand whether it's the language, the setting, or my inability to empathize with people; I just feel sorely disappointed with this supposed classic."
725,LaSibila,"Deprimente lo define. Es la palabra que menciona como 50 veces para definir el estado de ánimo del protagonista. Es una historia sobre un adolescente que no sabe qué quiere en la vida, pero no logra encontrarlo en esta novela. Es lo que haría la diferencia, en mi opinión."
726,Kate Mollohan,Talk about unreliable narrators. Not to mention it fits my list of books that don't live up to the hype.I've had to read it about four times and still don't enjoy it.
727,Leia Bunker,disappointing after all the hype! Annoying main character and distinct lack of plot or story. Not sure what all the fuss is about!
728,Elke,"Niet mijn boek en kan het ook niet opbrengen om er meer dan 1 ster voor te geven. Ik vind Holden een negatieve zeurzak, er zat niet of nauwelijks verhaal in het boek en het einde was ook nog eens een dikke tegenvaller. T is een classic die ik nu kan afstrepen op mn lijstje, maar daar houdt het op voor mij. Ik begrijp dat t boek op t moment van uitgave heel spannend en uitdagend is. Maar anno 2014 denk ik; hoevaak kun je phonies, I hate, it depresses me, she kills me, goddam en sunovabitch in 1 boek zetten. Uiteraard heb ik bij sommige stukjes ook wel een grijns op mn gezicht gehad."
729,Sam van Buuren,"Boring. Just some teen complaining about how much of a loser he is. Now, I complain as well, but I don't make a 100 page book out of it mr. Salinger. If at all possible, avoid. If your teacher forces you to read this pile of owl dribblets, tell her you will read Oscar Wilde instead."
730,Monica Alava,"I honestly had high hopes for this ""classic"", but as I was halfway into it, I realized that Holden Caulfield was a major bore. The book was painstakingly hard to read, and it took me days to finish it. Character development was at a snail's pace and even at the end, I felt that the book accomplished nothing. Disappointing. "
731,Zachariah N. Allison,"Despite being a ""classic"" in American literature, this book was dreadful. Utterly dreadful. Holden Caulfield has got to be one of most pessimistic and unpleasant protagonists I've ever come across. I can see him as a pre-cursor into what has become known as the ""goth"" style. If you ever get the opportunity to read this....don't. "
732,Leslie,"This is my least favorite book of all time. I felt that Holden Caulfield was the most pathetic character every created. It was not a poorly written book by any means, and it was an easy read. It was the subject matter and the plot, or lack of one, that really ruined it for me. I found myself hoping that he would die by the end of the book so that I didn't have to listen to him whine anymore. Anytime I recall that book, I only remember him whining and his very meaningless life. As a teenager, I had the standard angst and ""I know, I know!"" attitude, but I felt no relevance to this character. His attitude and demeanor were shameful and immature."
733,Benjamin Torres,"To use one of the countless phrases repeated over and over again in the book. ""It killed me, it really did"", of boredom and exasperation that is. Boredom because the story goes nowhere and exasperation not only because of Holden's attitude but the way it is written (the teenage like writting).I really can't see why people like this book, it is so repetitive and with such a flat story, that even the ending is weak. I get that it is probably a very accurate description of the mind of a sociopath and a cynical teenager, but that doesn't make it any more interesting, at least not for me."
734,Jyoti,"I'd like to know from others what it is they liked in this book. The teenage boy wasn't just direction less, he was depressingly disinterested in most things that life offered him. The language of the book wasn't inspiring either. I pushed myself to finish it only to figure the adoration some people have had for the book or for Holden Caulfield. Was it that at the time it was written, it was refreshing to read about an uninspired teenager? Haven't teenagers been always known to be a withdrawn, self-obsessed and uninspired lot?"
735,Jay,Rich kid that complains about everyone and everything that is not like him. This book wines like merlot. Only thing I can walk away with is the Hipster slang.
736,Alaysia,this book was DRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY !!!!! point blank ........ 
737,coll,"this book was one of the worst that i've ever had to read for class. i had to read it freshman year for english, and it just really had no point. all it was was this guy bitching for the entire book. nothing else. i wouldn't read it again and i wouldn't recommend that anyone else read it."
738,Elias,Absolutely insufferable. Only read 20 pages.
739,Frances,"I simply hated this book. The main character, Holden Caulfield, is a self absorbed little snot. Reading this as an adult I wanted to spank him and send him to his room without dinner. Salinger's use of profanity may have been cutting edge when Catcher in the Rye was first published but seems very gimmicky now. I have no idea why this book is raved about and considered a classic."
740,Dawna,"I'm pretty confident this is the worst book I've EVER read. What a waste of paper. There are SO many better books, don't waste your time."
741,Nidhi,"I do not recommend this book. I was curious about this one as I had heard how awesome it is from a bunch of friends and ex-classmates.My verdict in one word is: PATHETIC! A total waste of my time.I do not find a non-hard working person who is clueless about life appealing in any way. You may think that I am way too much of a Type-A person to say something like this but lets face it, even a Type-B person is nothing like this book's main character - Holden Caulfield. Sure, the book started off well and described a person belonging to a different era, and as much as I hate to admit it, I enjoyed getting an insight of this. But honestly, what I wanted was to GET DONE with this book as soon as I could. I was trying to reach the point where the protagonist would finally make his point about his so-called miserable born-with-a-silver-spoon-in his-mouth life. Unfortunately, this was a hopeless attempt on my part. I should have just sought Wikipedia's help to know everything (there is PLENTY information on this character and the book). The entire book describes what Mr. Caulfield goes through from a few hopeless days to a week - I can't believe that took 200+ pages! Kudos to J.D. Salinger for testing my patience with this one! I am not sure if I want to read any other book by this author, not without reading a snapshot on Wikipedia first i.e.At the end, the book just reminded me of the many failures out there in this world who are not driven to do anything in their lives, who think they are really 'cool' for no reason, who smoke all through time (because they think it is really cool without understanding the repercussions), who have an insane meaningless craving for physical pleasure (and go to unbelievable depths for that!) and who whine constantly for absolutely no reason (or in this case, may I say that the reason is his own self and the attitude he carries around?). Why not make a life worth living first?"
742,Chris Koch,Literary equivalent of Pollack dripping paint on canvas then smearing it around. only writing this review because so many people have so much to say about it.. but seriously ive had more fun watching paint dry and it was more of an introspective moment with the paint.
743,EmilyA,"I know I am one of the 4 people in the world who disliked this book, but if I hadn't been reading in school- I would have never finished it."
744,Kate Taylor-Doran,"I think this book is totally useless, it goes nowhere, there is no plot, there is a disgusting amount of time spent contemplating sexual encounters and the like. Plus, the main character is the whiniest little moron I've ever had in my head. "
745,Shruti,"It's so very difficult to rate a book 1 on 5 stars, especially when that book is topping the ""Best Books of 20th Century"" , ""Books everyone should read atleast once"" lists all over the planet earth.I don't know where to begin with, explaining what made me turn off while reading this book is difficult. The list is a terribly big one unfortunately. First and foremost I could just not take the language used by Salinger in the book. It was too much to handle for me..that slang American english lingo at its worst. All the swearing & I 'told ya', 'gotcha', 'helluva girl','wattyadoing' to name only the few decent ones. There were worse but I cant mention those here for obvious reasons.It was a pain when he kept saying 'that kills me', 'phony phony phony people', 'for chrissake', 'I swear Im a madman', 'Gosh you got to be in a mood to call a girl like that' & a million more phrases that he generously kept repeating throughout the book. I just wish Salinger made a slightly better choice of words and gave in some more time to editing the 'most popular book of the 20th century' for god sake.Coming to the story line, to tell u the truth, I couldn't find any. My ereader showed I was 80% through the book and I still was trying to figure out what the story was. Infact it looked like a collection of short stories in the initial few chapters of the book, all unrelated.There are 2 things I absolutely detest about the book -1) Salinger making fun of Charles Dickens ( Even to compare Charles Dicken's writings to something like this is a sin I feel)2) I HATED the way the book ended. Its like the writer jut got bored of the emotional instability of Holden Caulfield and decided to put an end to his reader's ordeal.It's pain to think why authors writing on topics as sensitive as these don't take some more pain to give their books an ending atleast, forget about a good ending!I am one of the millions of them who just could not 'get'' the book & was left wondering how could something like that be appreciated like the way it was being. 2 things I badly need to do after this:1) Read a good British authored book to come over the American cultural shock.2) Research more about whether a book ends well before I choose it as my next one. This is the 2nd book I've read in a row with a terible ending. I don't think I can take more of that for quite sometime now. Pretty Disappointed."
746,Whitney,"When people even bring up this book, my first reaction is just ""Nope."" I didn't like this book at all. I feel like there are either people who love it or hate it. I hated Holden. I understand why he is the way he is, but that doesn't make me want to read about him. I get that teenagers are super angsty. I get all of that. But this book is awful. I've read it multiple times, thinking that my views may change--but they never do. I would give it a 0 if possible. "
747,Tom Waite,I thought I would re-read this book after 50 years. I do not understand how I could have liked this book when I was 14. Hold on to the memory. Don't destroy it by reading it again!
748,M.W. Johnston,"Okay, so usually when I'm thinking about buying a book I'll read the first couple of paragraphs on the first page. If the book doesn't immediately grab my attention then I will not buy it. Unfortunately, this book was forced upon me in high school and I had to suffer the depressing drawl of the protagonist for a few weeks. Most people probably won't appreciate my review, thinking 'OMG! The Catcher in the Rye is a classic and should be read by everyone.' Halt. Do not go there. Please read my review before reading someone else's, I beg of you. This book is incredibly, unfathomably, tremendously boring. So boring in fact, that I am getting bored with this review.Abandon all hope ye who enter here for this book is pish!"
749,Katherine Anthony,"I read this one in high school, and it felt like I was the only one in the class who hated it. I guess I just really didn't relate to Holden - he didn't come across as the cool, misunderstood youth he was trying to affect, but as a complainer who did things just because he wasn't supposed to. Maybe I need to reread..."
750,Grace,"This book was a compilation of pre-pubescent musings and pointless vulgarity. The supposed ""musings"" of a teenage boy revealed only what one would expect: an obsession with sex and a total lack of understanding of social niceties."
751,Lil D,This is supposed to be a classic...I hated it. Neither story nor writing captivated me. I guess I just didn't get it.
752,Niki,"I could NOT stand Holden, the main character. I found his manor of speaking very repeatative & annoying. His pestimistic view on everything & everyone I thought was immature & whiney. "
753,Jimmy Osterhout,"Ultimately, I wanted to reach into the pages, grab Holden by the neck and scream,""GROW THE FUCK UP YOU RAMBLING LITTLE SHIT!""What's irritating is that I read this in my early twenties and hoped that in someway I would relate to Salinger's insipid creation. Truth is that I didn't and I won't. "
754,Emily ,"It was okay, but not really good. And also, the plot is horrible and Holden, omg he's such a rebellious kid. I can't believe my class had to read this banned book. Well, I'm really glad that its over. "
755,Kyla,"I wanted to give this book 2 stars because I understood it, I really did. But that does not necessarily mean i liked it. And if I did give it more stars than it deserved, then I'd definitely be a ""phony"".I get the angst, I get the obsessive contradictions and self hatred, and I get why people like it. I personally did not like this book and that's perfectly okay."
756,Kat,"I chose this book as the basis for my 11th grade AP English project based on excellent reviews and the fact that it was a ""banned"" book. I absolutely hated it. You'll hear people talk about Holden being depressed and isolated, but I didn't get that from him. All I saw was ""ASSHOLE"". He's a self centered, self righteous, obnoxious pain in the ass. I don't know where he pulled his sense of entitlement from, or why he presents himself as a victim, but all of the things that happen to him are his own doing, a result of poor decision making/impulse control and arrogance. "
757,Kyle,"I was excited to finally read The Catcher in the Rye; I'd stupidly been putting it off for years, but after doing so I'm disappointed that I spent money on it.It's possible I read this book at the wrong time in my life, because you see while growing up I was a bit of a misanthrope, especially in my days at middle school, and I often despised people, kind of like Holden, but I grew up.Holden Caulfield comes of as nothing more than a spoiled, arrogant teenager, afraid to be alone and can't decide what he wants in his life. He regards anyone he doesn't like as ""phonies"" or ""bastards."" In all actuality he's quite the masochist, he puts himself into these situations, and surrounds himself with people he hates, except for of course his little sister. (Who he's a total douche-bag to)Salinger's writing was also often repetitive, at times I felt as though I was reading the same thing over and over again.I am sort of glad that I read it though, I always thought I was a negative, cynical person, but now I know I'm not, for that title can only go to Holden Caulfield."
758,Justin Thornton,Boring coming-of-age book where nothing happens until the end when Holden gets diarrhea and the very last paragraph alludes the idea that he's been admitted to a psych ward.
759,Raul Melendez,"This book sucked! I was extremely excited to read it because of the raving review given it by a new friend I read. The woman said it was such a great book she reads it at least once a year. Wow, I thought. This must be a great book. What a joke! Holden is a whiny little rich kids who needs to be slapped. Not even half way through the book I started reading the first sentence of every paragraph, just so I might be able to get through it. I still had to put it down on page 135. What am I missing? There was nothing compelling about Holden OR the story itself.Thankfully, after several years of forcing myself to finish every book I ever started, I finally gave myself permission to shelf books that weren't cutting the mustard. If there is anyone out there who can explain what it is I obviously missed, please feel free to comment. But nothing happened; Salinger didn't make me care about his character; and (from what I understand, because I didn't make it that far) there is NO payoff at the end, either.There is a movie coming out soon called Salinger (or maybe it's already out) that I was excited about. Now I have almost no interest in it whatsoever. Maybe I am expecting too much from the books that are considered to be classics ... but this DID NOT deliver. If Salinger were still alive I don't think I would ever read anything else he wrote."
760,Adele Coburn,Horrible. I hated every minute of reading this book. Nothing happeneed the whole time! Not to mention how annoying Holden was. The crude language throughout the whole book was also unbearable. Just a terrible read altogether.
761,Kaitlin,"I have this set as To Read. It should be set to TO READ AGAIN. I HATED this book the first time I read it in 8th grade. I AM willing to give it another try seeing as how I am much older and much wiser. Also, I need to understand how this is a life changing read for everyone. Feel free to expand on why I should love this book. :-)"
762,Paras Kapadia,Never will I try to finish a book that I don't like. 'Phony' is all I can say
763,Ashley Lois,Not impressed at all :( I was expecting so much more from this novel and I unfortunately never got it
764,Amanda Mastran,"I know I'm in the minority when I say this, but I absolutely despised this book. A whole book about one day in the life of a very angry adolescent boy. Enough already.Although, this book is probably more guy-oriented. In fact, all of the men that I know who've read this book loved it. Most of the women I know who've read it found it as painful as I did. "
765,Romi,"I'm not sure what to say about this quite yet... the only thing I really liked about it was the ""If a body meet a body comin' through the rye"" part."
766,Jeiflyn Dizon,"I stopped reading this book so many times but kept returning to it just for the sake of finding the reason why it's so 'controversial', a deeper meaning perhaps. Alas, i finished the book with no such enlightenment. In the end, it was just plain dull."
767,Lindsaygossrn,Why would anyone think this book is a classic? Horrible lack of a plotline and poorly written. had to put it down before completely finishing because I was quite frankly offended.
768,Ronnie Cama,"The way the book is written, with its casual language and truthful thoughts of the characters, made me experience a series of ungrateful feelings eventually I had to fight myself to get to the end convincing myself that it would get better eventually. My favorite thing was Holden's sister and the way she related to her brother. Holden often made me see things from an interesting and revealing point of view. When getting to the end I was disappointed with the reading, because I had expected so much more action and drama, but I would have loved to read this in its first years, because maybe then I would have felt different things,but well I recommend to do a research of the times this was published and get the idea of the context in order to really appreciate the reading."
769,Nathan Titus,"forced to read this one in high school. I offer here a one sentence review that I am borrowing from someone else. It's actually something a girl in a bar said to me, while we were shit-talking over drinks, which sums this book up perfectly.THE ENTIRE BOOK IS: ""LOOK AT ME, I'VE GOT TEEN ANGST.""one sentence, and it's not even my own. this boo deserves nothing more. "
770,Robby,"Really overrated and whiny. I'm not sure why this book is so popular. The book is just about a privileged teenager getting kicked out of prep school and whining about his first world problems. The only time the book had much meaning to me is when Holden talked about his siblings. Salinger does seem like a witty writer, but this story and the character was very frustrating to read. I wouldn't recommend it, but maybe I'm the wrong person to read this book."
771,Shane Leftridge,"A complete and total waste of time, that is unless you have run out of toilet paper. The most uninspiring, dull and dud of an ending in the history of modern literature. "
772,Mariah,"""The Catcher in the Rye"" is about a boy named Holden who has just been expelled from his fourth boarding school. He then takes off to New York on his own, hiding from his parents so he does not have to break the news to them that he has yet again failed to behave himself long enough to make it through a school year in one place. He meets different teachers, a prostitute, New York girls, an old girlfriend, an old school friend, and strangers, and doesn't have many nice things to say about any of them. He is a boy who does not know where he is going in life, and doesn't know how to figure out a destination for himself.I have not seen the movie, because I thought reading the book alone was a waste of time. In fact, I was unaware until recently that a movie had even been made, but now that I know, I may look into watching it. Maybe it will explain to me why this book is considered a ""classic"".I have read this book before, and did not like it the first time around. I thought I might gain some insight the second time as to why this is considered a ""classic"", but I was proven wrong. Holden is still just a spoiled schoolboy running around shirking his responsibilities and complaining about everything and everyone. It lacks plot and climax, and was not well-written; the text is in the slang and undisciplined language of a teenage boy. I would not recommend this book to anyone: don't waste your time on it. "
773,Jakub,"When reading a book like The Catcher in the Rye, you either identify with the main character and see things from their perspective or you don't. I didn't...Throughout the whole book, I've found Holden's behaviour irrational and his reasoning childish and immature, even though I'm quite close to his age.I have been anticipating some philosophical meaning or something that would make reading this book memorable for me. But nah, I've failed to find such a thing.But enough of the scolding. This book have some bright moments which will temporarily touch you. It can be quite entertaining if you consider it as Sunday afternoon / I'm bored at school/work kind of reading. But to consider it one of the best novels of 20th century..?"
774,Malachijs,"Everything in Holden's life is ""so damn depressing."" It's just some random events that happen to him during a two day period, but not with any real story or point to it. Just stay away "
775,Ega Tamboen,"First when i read this book, I was expecting something more from Salinger. I kept opening the pages to fulfill my expectation, but i didn't get any. I was disappointed because the book was only talking about the ungrateful kid that whining so much about everything. It made think back when i was 14, did i whining so much like that kid, but i again i didn't think so. Well, after i finished, i didn't get the message what Salinger tried to deliver. "
776,Luv,"Im not sure if it was something I just couldn't grasp but I didn't enjoy reading this book at all. It was sort of frustrating at times how he kept reiterating himself i.e. I didnt like people like that, sometimes I did but most of the time I couldn't stand them etc. I couldn't really see what the point of the book was- him not really understanding himself? It was pointless imho. Definitely not a book I would recommend anyone read and not a book I would re-read myself."
777,Margarete,"Однажды один мой друг сказал ""Я вылитый Холден Колфилд!"". Я чуть ли не на следущий день кинулась в книжный, чтобы купить ""Над пропастью во ржи"". Но... еще читая первые строки, я поняла, какой будет эта книга. Вражения типа ""дурацкое детство"" и ""дэвид-коперфильдовская муть"" стразу настроили меня скептически. Недавно я читала критическую статью Добролюбова о ""Грозе"" Островского, где он пишет: ""нельзя же согласиться и на то, что драматический автор, ради верности, может вносить в литературу все площадные выражения, которыми так богат русский народ. Язык драматических персонажей, кто бы они ни были, может быть прост, но всегда благороден и не должен оскорблять образованного вкуса."" Путь народ не русский, пусть американский. Суть та же. Вы скажете, что это для более точной передачи образа? Да как бы там ни было, читать неприятно.Второй главный компонент хорошей книги после красоты языка - это сюжет. Его тут нет совсем. Большую часть и без того малюсенькой книжки составляют ""лирические"" (в кавычках, потому что никакие они не лирические) отступления. Но казалось бы, это же филосовское произведение! Значит, сюжет не так уж и важен? А я отвечу, что сюжет важен всегда. Без динамичного сюжена книга никогда не будет увлекательной. Ставим троечку.Чувственность. Это вроде как главное в этой книге, залезть в душу молодому читателю, полному отрицания всего вокруг. Вот на что я бунтарка, меня холден-колфилдовская философия не задела никак. Объяснений его порой глупым поступкам нет никакого. Конечно, что-то заставляющее подумать тут есть, но почему эту книгу называют ""гимном хиппи"" и выдающимся произведением современной литературы, я не знаю. "
778,Diana Elliott,"My 3rd book group bookOne of the very few books I have given up on!I just could not get into the right mind set to read this one, so only got through the first third - at a struggle!"
779,Haley Reed,"I did not like this book, but they may be because I was forced to read it for school. I didn't like Holden,the main character, because was such a hyprocrate and a 'phony'. Just horrible. "
780,Tom Mcrae,Overrated 
781,Aideen,"I read this book as anyone I know seemed to love it, I am pretty sure it's the only book I have ever HATED. There I could go on to explain why but I couldn't waste any more of my life on this book than I already have"
782,Caroline,"I hated this book. I could not connect to it. I know everyone read it in high school, but I didn't. I just read it this summer and I just really hated it."
783,Deborah,"I didn't get why this was a classic and I didn't even think it was that good of a story. Maybe that makes me an ignoramus, but that's just the way it is."
784,Carolina,"I am not going to grovel, or start raging on about what I did not like about this book, because if I do, I will go off on a tangent. I just think Holden should grow up. It's called being polite, not phony. And he needs to realize that the world is not out to get him. It's all about survival and with his attitude, he won't be succeeding. "
785,Zoë Barlow,"Honestly, I hated listened to snarky Holden Caufeild ramble about his boring and privileged life at a boarding school. He has no class, and not much he says is interesting."
786,J. Boo,"It's hard to make it out of high school in the USA without having ""Catcher in the Rye"" as assigned reading. As a piece of literature, it makes for an excellent career guide: students who will become English teachers love it passionately. Those who consider becoming English teachers but wind up going into other jobs are neutral. Everyone else hates the main character's whinging and Salinger's execrable prose.Guess which camp I'm in."
787,Ruth,"Oh yuck! I didn't like Holden's whining as a teen when I read it and liked it even less when I read it as an adult. But, I get this is a classic that resonates with a lot of young readers and is remembered by generations. "
788,Elizabeth,I hate this book.The whole time I wanted Holden to shut his bitching up.The only reason I read it was because they made us in school
789,Hari Hara Rohit Divakaruni,"I have been very patient while reading the first 70 pages. 70 pages! can u believe it. I do not understand what was the point made by salinger broadly. Clearly it seems to be some kind of a ""Phony"" biography. I felt like ""Puking"". I think Holden, the protagonist, is out of world. It seems he feels himself to be the one who is elegant or rather ""NOT PHONY"". Anything he sees, he feels like puking. i ultimately had to withdraw from reading it. how come 3.79/5? It is definitely not a ""goodread"" book."
790,Joy,"This is possibly the most boring book I've ever read. No plot line whatsoever. Nothing happens. You think, ""Maybe this is it! Maybe something is about to happen!"" But instead, it's the end of the book and you're left feeling confused, unsatisfied, and a little angry."
791,Kelsey Bellows,"Boring and frustrating, I found Holden to be one of the most annoying and selfish characters that has even been written. "
792,Theresa,"I felt it was too painful to read and could not finish the book.Lots of teenage angst, didn't really understand the plot except that the boy kept going places and refused to return back to school..I guess perhaps, it was not my type of book."
793,Rusminin,"Probably one of the most worthless books I've ever read. During the course of a book, the main character does virtually nothing. Instead, he makes attempts of introspects and drools on and on about his life and the things he's going to do... or more presicely - not going to do. Key point is - probably anyone around a certain age had similar sentiments of the whole pointless in life and artificiality of paths laid before him. But we don't go writing a bloody book about it! Mainly because these notions are purely emotins induced by the age. They are not thought through, they are not logically rationalised, they won't help with any conclusion, they don't summirise any facts of life in any constructive way. They re just there. And so we don't write a book, though it will be of an equal value to this one and we certaily don't make pretenciously ""deep"" and ""profound"" conclusions like ""What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff"". You want a proper exploration of a emotional repulsion of life, of inability to do anything through despising any possible way due to it's meaningless? Go watch ""Big Lebowsky"" or read ""Oblomov"". But this book is not the book."
794,Darcysmom,I've read it more than once. I have never liked the story. Holden bugs the heck out of me. I have finally decided that I am not the target audience and never have been.
795,Longpaw,"I read this when I was in 10th grade. my teacher wanted us to write a 3 page synopses, witch I refused to do. since all I have to say about this book takes up less then a phonograph. ""Holden stupid and selfish kid who never seem to learn his lesson or grow up. This book has no meaning to it, and should be toss in the trash along with wild animus."" I do not see how this could ever be considered a ""classic""."
796,Madhu R,"I just didn't get it. I know people LOOOOVE this book and I'm really glad they found something meaningful or poetic, but I read it as an adult who wanted to slap this emo priviledged kid. You wanna know where the ducks go in the winter, they fly to the South where it's warm, dumbass! But he'd know that if he stayed in school. Also, the whole payoff of finding out where ""catcher in the rye"" title comes from was disappointing. Unlike ""to kill a mockingbird"".....or even ""you shall know our velocity!"". "
797,Krizna,"I hate this book. I hate Holden. He is annoying plus all the cursing's not amusing at all. Maybe if I read this again in the future, my perception will change. But as of the moment, I HATE IT. Adios."
798,➸ Gwen de Sade,"Okay, so this was my second Salinger novel and I think he's just really not for me. After being disappointed a lot in ""Franny and Zoey"" I took a look into the plot of this one and I really looked forward to reading a book about a troubled youth and his experiences. Instead, I received a story that was very dull most of the time. Since the book is told in first person there is a lot of Holden's inner monologue - which is repetitive and annoying due to his ranting about almost everything. All this being said, the book maybe isn't too bad from a literary perspective. It holds many themes such as the painfulness of growing up, sexuality and depression. But overall I just didn't enjoy it."
799,Renae,"I think my 13-16 year old self would have really enjoyed this book. Holden Caulfield is a 16 year old, who flunked out of prep school, and has to figure out what to do with his life. If he was in our era, and your Facebook friend, you may see him post status updates such as ""Shit happens, mostly to me."" His angst, and attitude that it's not him, it's society and everyone else, resonates through just about every line that comes out of his mouth. Again, if I was 13-16 years old, I'd be shaking his hand, going YES, darn this forsaken world!But I'm not 13. I'm 23.And at 23, I find Caulfield painfully annoying. A lad who comes off as self-important, unappreciative, and narrow-minded. And perhaps at that age, we're all like that. And at the end of the book, I just wanted to shake him and say grow up, kid, the world isn't about you and if you want to see a change, you go ahead and do something about it and stop blaming everyone and everything else. Granted, a book spanning a weekend doesn't provide anyone, 13 or 63, much time to pull themselves together after a setback and even begin to do anything about anything... But come on, this Holden fella doesn't even want to start thinking about it. At the end of each chapter, Holden seems to reflect upon what has happened and end off with a little nugget of wisdom or revelation. And that's it. It's as if he just shrugs it off, and goes back to being the one with ""one of those very phony, Ivy League voices, one of those very tired snobby voices"". A character so detached from reality, that it got me thinking whether he was suffering from anything like Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, since he can't seem to come to terms with his brother's death. Perhaps then reading it as a case study of PTSD, or knowing more about the particular time period and environment the book was set in, would have framed my reading experience a little better. But I guess, in the end, the main reason I don't quite fancy the book is because I could never grasp what the book is. I just couldn't find the common thread besides Holden's attitude. And if Holden's attitude and understanding of his reality is the main point... then what was the point? Psychological realism? Commentary? What?Really though, at the end I just found that this book was the equivalent of that one negative friend who radiates negativity and does not want to do anything about it. A friend would not want in my life. The same with this book. "
800,Kate Wolf,"The entire time I waited for something to happen... and then it ended. I don't understand how this is considered a classic, all Holden Caulfield does the entire book is complain. It's a 300 page teenage ranting."
801,Judy,"I'm not even going to review this. The author probably wrote this while he was high. Like holy fudge it was bad. Holden needs to stop complaining about everyone being a phony, deal with it, that's life for you."
802,Melody Hesse,"I was told that this is a must read classic. I barely made it through the first few chapters, was board to death. "
803,Ria Murrin MacDonald,"I thought it was horrible. I am so sorry to the author. This could have been much better written. I read this because it was on a list of books that every person must read. I have heard this book referenced so many times- I really thought it was going to be a good book. It was boring. I did sympathize with Holden about losing his brother, but for the rest of it I found that he was an entitled brat that needed to smarten up and get over himself. I apologize to the author and to the fans of this novel, but I had a really hard time reading this. "
804,Shweta Shalmali,"I actually hated the book. I completed the book, only for the sake of completing it. I wonder, why is this book an all time classic. I found nothing good about the book, neither the story, nor the way of writing.Wondering if I read this book very late in my life, and if it had been in my teens, I might have given it a couple more stars. No, even then no!"
805,Julian,"I did not think it was very interesting book,kind of all other the place. Holden was a odd character and couldnt understand him as well as I should had.I would not recommend this book to no one. "
806,Erin,"This book was boring. Nothing happened. The whole time I was waiting for some actual plot to develop, but then the book ended. What a waste."
807,Nicolle,I had to force my self to finish this book. Not sure why it is considered a classic. I understand the whole struggle of not wanting to grow up and all of that but still I thought that this book was very boring.
808,Erik,"I'm 42 years old, and have never read this book until now. Somehow, I just didn't get what all the fuss has been about this one over the years. I never ""connected"" with the story or with the protagonist, and found myself continuing to the end for the mere sake of finishing."
809,Fanofbruce,"I never had to read this book while I was in school. As a result, it took me a while to pick it up at the library. I had really high expectations. This book is suppose to be one of the greatest of all time. So, I sat down and started reading. Basically, it is an a-hole doing a-hole things. I know this is blunt, but true. Overall, I was sadly disappointed. "
810,Eric,"To be fully honest I did not finish this book, so my review is made with slight reservations. I can see how some readers could enjoy a book like this, but frankly I found the writing style disjointed and did not enjoy reading."
811,Brock,"Perhaps the worst book I have ever read. With a world of wonderful literature available, why this book continues to be foisted on high school students never ceases to amaze me."
812,Klaas Johannes,This is the first book I haven't been able to finish. Not even on a 12 hour flight to San Francisco. I'll try again in a couple of years. I absolutely didn't like the way the story was told (perspective). Of course this is my personal opinion. I'm trying to read some of the American classics. The first one I read was 'To Kill a Mockinbird' which I found great. Unfortunately 'Catcher in the Rye' didn't meet my expectations. 
813,Samantha Choo,Whiny. But I suppose it depends on when in your life you read this.
814,Amanda Fletcher,"Completely overrated. Holden has to be one of the most irritating characters ever written, who on earth would want to spend 200 pages with an idiotic teenager is beyond me. I truly detest his book, thankfully it was short, which is all it had going for it in my opinion."
815,Daisy,"I didn't really see the point of this book, maybe that could have been down to the fact that I didn't finish reading it? But it just dragged on so I lost all hope in it."
816,Nick Nillo,"I never had the chance to read this book when I was a child so I decided to read this as a nostalgic trip to adolescence. I had read great reviews about this book and thought it would be good considering the fact that it's a literary classic. However, this is by far the WORST book I have ever read and will remain a benchmark which has not yet been surpassed. I remember reading Jim Fowels' ""The Collector"" in which the main character reads this book and claims he didn't enjoy it and disliked how the main main character in the Catcher in the Rye ""talked."" I feel the same way, he talks with a archetypal propeller hat youth tone of voice. Would not recommend this book to anyone and I will devote a portion of my life to recommending that no one should read it."
817,Paul Groinus,"Now I know why they have students read this in high school: that is the only age that can relate to the main character. For me, it just brings up all the pain and stupidity of my past.Seven months of sporadic reading have been spent on this outdated and out-of-touch piece of garbage."
818,Kelly,Never liked this classic too much! If I wanted to listen to a teenager complain about his unfortunate rich circumstance I would watch reality t.v.
819,Kia Hernandez,"It pains me to rate a book with only one star, considering that I was really interested with The Catcher in the Rye. It's either you identify with Holden that you liked the book, or you are just like any other kid who wishes to enjoy a ""classic"" but ended up being disappointed because of all the whining the character did throughout the entire book. I am still figuring out how J.D Salinger's work ""changed the lives"" of many through this. "
820,Sadie Harrison,"Had to read this in school. I hate required reading.I hate coming of age stories.I hate obvious metaphors.I hate whining teenagers.I hate the word ""phony.""I hate this book.HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATE."
821,Steve McKee,Stupid kid without empathy or brains stole two hours of my life I can never get back. Why is this the favorite book of so many people?
822,Stéphanie,Je me suis réellement forcée à finir ce livre. L'histoire a peu d'intérêt et surtout Caulfield est une sacrée tête à claque qui me semble être d'avantage une caricature d'ado que la représentation juste de ce que l'on peut ressentir à l'adolescence. Pour moi il est juste un gosse de riche qui se croit au dessus de tout et des autres. Bref une vraie déception après toutes les critiques élogieuses que j'ai pu lire.
823,Martin Roberts,"I succumbed to pressure to read this book during a visit to the States many years ago, to see what the fuss was all about. I was none the wiser when I'd finished. Rich kid doesn't want to go to school today, throws a book-length tantrum. So what? Maybe what is significant is that it was published just as the term ""teenager"" was being coined and -- largely -- self-indulgent ""youth culture"" had arrived."
824,Rachel Gale,"Once upon a time, I read a book called The Catcher in the Rye, all on my own free will. And it was the worst decision I have ever made.Somehow I missed that entire, ""I'm a useless teenager"" phase of thinking, so this book wasn't some radical piece of literature that changed my life. It was a waxing prose about some whiny boy doing dumb things. I honestly enjoy clipping my own fingernails more than I enjoyed reading this book.I kid you not. It took me a year after I read this...thing... to pick up another book. The Hunger Games saved my Goodreads account."
825,Matthew Nichols,"Hated this book so much. It was so depressing Holden just hates everything, it almost made me hate everything. There isn't even a decent plot, the guy just goes around getting drunk and hating life. This guy is such a spoiled little punk, he's got tons of money that he could use to get into a better school, but spends it all on liquor. I'm suprised that he didn't kill himself, he was certainly talking like he did. If I could describe this book in a single word it would be loathsome. I give it five star.... negative five."
826,Chau Truong,"The novel is set around the 1950s and is narrated by a young man named Holden Caulfield. Holden is not specific about his location while he’s telling the story, but he makes it clear that he is undergoing treatment in a mental hospital. The events he narrates take place in the few days between the end of the fall school term and Christmas, when Holden is sixteen years old. Holden’s story begins on the Saturday following the end of classes at the Pencey prep school in Agerstown, Pennsylvania. Pencey is Holden’s fourth school; he has already failed out of three others. At Pencey, he has failed four out of five of his classes and has received notice that he is being expelled, but he is not scheduled to return home to Manhattan until Wednesday. He visits his elderly history teacher, Spencer, to say goodbye, but when Spencer tries to reprimand him for his poor academic performance, Holden becomes annoyed. Back in the dormitory, Holden is further irritated by his unhygienic neighbor, Ackley, and by his own roommate, Stradlater. Stradlater spends the evening on a date with Jane Gallagher, a girl whom Holden used to date and whom he still admires. During the course of the evening, Holden grows increasingly nervous about Stradlater’s taking Jane out, and when Stradlater returns, Holden questions him insistently about whether he tried to have sex with her. Stradlater teases Holden, who flies into a rage and attacks Stradlater. Stradlater pins Holden down and bloodies his nose. Holden decides that he’s had enough of Pencey and will go to Manhattan three days early, stay in a hotel, and not tell his parents that he is back. Sincerely, I discovered this book quite flat. The fact that the main character, Holden keeps complaining about everything and acts like he’s going to make a big deal out of anything that people do making me sick and tired of reading. I know some of my friends really enjoy reading the novel while I know some is also sick and bored of the main character, Holden. Salinger did a terrible job on bringing the main character, Holden out to the readers. Holden seems just like any other teenager at his age, young, wild, and stupid. I cannot see how Holden is outstanding or differed from any other traditional characters. Also, the novel contains a lot of inappropriate images, vulgarities, violence, and sexual contents which is very reasonable for me to state that they’re the weaknesses of the novel.To be straightforward, I do not recommend this book to anyone at all. In my experience, it was one of the most boring books I have ever read until now. The plot is boring and has an inappropriate content. Overall, I have to admit that it was a quick and easy to read. I didn’t find any trouble reading it at all. As a comparison, I would compare the Catcher in the Rye to Franny and Zooey where they both bring out the theme that the full of phoniness in the adult world, the painfulness of growing up, and isolation as a form of self-protection. "
827,Andrea Delesdernier,"Overrated. I'm sure I'll incur wrath from loyalists for this comment. While I'm at it, I think the Beatles are overrated too. Great descriptions and character speak. But NOTHING ever happens. I know it was written in the mid 1940s so it's not as relevant. ""On The Road"" was written around the same time, and I think OTR captures the time period and the beginning of youth disenfranchisement much better. All these years and I never read Catcher, with all the hype I expected much more. My exact thoughts after closing the book, ""that's it?"""
828,Amirhossein17,به مزاجم نمیخورد. دو سه صفحه اولشو که خوندم با برخورد به یه سری کلمات قید خوندنشو زدم...
829,Michelle Council,"The only thing I liked about this book was the way it was written, or rather the way Holden Caulfield talks. When I first started out reading it I was immediately interested by the language, but the interest didn't stick. Is isolating yourself from the world a good way to protect yourself? Holden thinks he is above everyone else and doesn't want to hear any criticism, so he isolates himself from the rest of the world. Personally though, I think Holden is just plain difficult and a pain in the rear. I think if he didn't try to isolate himself so much he might have had an easier time throughout his transition from his teenage years to adulthood."
830,Britney,"Holden Caulfield is a 17-year-old boy who has got himself expelled from Pencey Preparatory 3 days before winter break. He gets fed up with school and decides to leave early, catching a train to New York to spend a few days before going home. There he goes to a run down hotel and does the following: calls up people, talks to them, tries to get a drink, fail to do so, and walk around contemplating how almost everyone around him is a moron. 	I give this book a 1 because it is awful. There are several reasons why I do not like this book. The main character is infuriating, the plot is boring, the writing is repetitive, and I got nothing from this book except for a feeling of disappointment and depression. First off, Holden is incredibly annoying. His attitude about how people are fake and superficial gets old really quickly. I really wanted to relate to him because I do feel that his opinions are true sometimes but with his constant gripping about the world, he doesn’t do anything about it. He is in this perpetual state of mind of not wanting to grow up and becoming an adult in an artificial world. The topic itself is relatable but it was written in a way that he just seemed immature and self-righteous. He just couldn’t understand that yes, growing up is not great and you want to keep the innocence and happiness from your childhood but you need to get over it. You should cherish your childhood but you should also learn from it and Holden could never seem to grasp that. Another reason I don’t like Holden, though a small one, is his vocabulary. There is a point where you swear so often that the words become meaningless. Holden has gone far past that point.Second, the plot of this book is so dull. Holden doesn’t do much throughout the story except walk around and tell the reader how phony everything is. There isn’t a climax anywhere. The plot line might as well be a line. There was no point in the book I really could say Holden learned anything or that his character changed. The pacing is very slow too. The author made the story longer than it needed to be and kept repeating phrases and plot ideas that only drew out the story even more. Even though this is not a plot driven book, I felt that Salinger could of thought of a more thought-provoking or at least interesting story for Holden. 	Overall this book left me feeling depressed because it kept reminding me that I have a finite amount of time to be a kid. I don’t need that to be shoved in my face. It continued to tell me information I already knew but that is all it did. There was no deep thinking involved when I finished or questions to be answered. When I closed the book, I stop caring about the story and the characters. There was nothing I took from this book. It was just about a rich kid who decided to “rebel against the system” and hate everything and everyone around him. This book expected me to relate to some whiny kid who can’t get out of his own head. I was so disappointed. I had such high hopes and I watched them fall to ground and break into a million pieces. Just because a book is considered a classic, that does not means it’s good or should be a called a classic."
831,Patrice,"I think for all the books that I cannot recall the date I read them, I'm using January 1, 2010. This is another book from high school that I read of my own free will. It was popular, so I though that I would give it a try. That was a mistake. It dragged on without really going anywhere and I detested the main character. He was obnoxious and whiny and I really could not stand him. It is a miracle that I finished this book at all."
832,Daisy Rodriguez,This is the most boring book I ever tried to read. I couldnt even finish. All holden talks about is people being phony. I wouldnt recommend this for anyone.
833,Patrick,"Before the disaffected identity of Bella Swan, came the petite b malcontent, Holden Caulfield. Need I say more. All punctuation intended."
834,Geanine Teramani- cruz,Poor little rich kid. This book was nothing more than a whine session from a privileged little brat. Never will understand how this is supposed to be a classic . 
835,Shelsea,"There is a reason this book is meant to be read while still in high-school. It is nothing but the whiny, consistent bitching of a spoiled brat. By the end, you want to smack the main character across the face and tell him to live in the real world. There is no significant climax to speak of, and reads much like the diary of the most annoying kid in class. If your older then 16, don't even bother. "
836,Batoul Farghaly,"Maybe the book was so controversial when it first came out, but I read it in 2009 to know what the fuss was about and felt it was highly overrated and disappointing! I didn't mind the cursing as much as it was the non existing line/plot of the story."
837,Astrid Whirley,"Not sure why this is a classic. I really didn't enjoy reading the book at all. I was very annoyed with the main character's negativity throughout the entire book. I thought he was a 16 year old loser! The book was really about nothing. The book spoke about a 16 year old loser who was kicked out of 4 high schools, drank, smoke, cussed, spoke negatively about everyone and everything, and never wanted to face any of his bad decisions. The book didn't even end well. This book was very unexciting and uneventful! At least he had a smart sister. "
838,Situationist 95,READ KING DORK & Stop This Cult
839,Peter Crouse,Rarely have I wanted to smack someone more than Holden Caulfield. This kid will not stop whining! I simply cannot relate to his extreme blend of cynicism and teenage angst; it all seems so trivial. This one's for the mulcher. 
840,Briana Patterson,"I read this back in high school for my AP English class. Yeesh. Where do I begin? I was first attracted to it as a blessedly upfront dialogue with gritty language after abandoning David Copperfield in disgust. What do you know? He makes a funny little reference against the Charles Dickens monstrocity in the first few sentences. That almost gets Salinger one more star from me on principal. However, I can't say that the interest stuck. This book is the epitome of depression-filled, angsty gobbledygook that high schools shove down teenagers throats in an effort to make them think deep thoughts - or to attempt to relate to them somehow. It's true that there were many times that I felt depressed and alienated in high school. Somehow reading about it in literature did nothing for any sort of need for me. Maybe it does for some people, but I think it was bad enough dealing with it in reality than reading some dismal thing and exploring its dark depths of depravity.I really don't know why they advertise such emotionally unstable stuff to a group of people with raging hormones anyway. I'm not saying to ban it. People should be able to read what they want. I just don't think it should be required reading. It seems to be fuel for more depression.I mean this in sardonic facetiousness: it's not the swearing dialogue, or the character's behavior that makes it so inappropriate. It's the fact that one might want to slash their wrists after this read. We always talked about how we're supposed to talk about and reflect how literature affects us in school. Then we wonder why a huge percentage of people are pumped up on prozac and other happy pills. :P"
841,Stiby,"No me pareció nada interesante, no conseguí meterme en la historia, los personajes no me gustaban... Acabé el libro por cabezonería, pero con un poco menos de fuerza de voluntad, lo habría dejado a medias."
842,Trelesa,"Excessive language. Excessive whining! No plot. I do have an content-edited edition if anyone would like to waste their time reading this ""classic"".."
843,Ruthi,"Okay, so I read this book thinking it would be great. I read it thinking that it was going to ""change my life"" like it supposedly had for so many others. You want to know all I learned from this book? Holden is a whiny bastard who complains about everything, is as fake as they come and pretends to be an intellectual. He's a typical teenager. Honestly, go talk to a typical teenager for a day and you'll get everything you would've got out of the book. I don't see why people claim this is a classic.It's rubbish."
844,Annie Le,"Such a disappointing classic. I couldn't even get into its story line. One star for lots of cuss words, or else it would have been rated ZERO. "
845,Annemarie,most boring book i ever read.
846,Stefan Percy,"So many people have told me that I really needed to read this book. Well, I finally did and I am now regretting it. Cannot say that there was much in this book that I actually enjoyed.Old Holden Caulfield is a whiny little snot that complains about everything, and I mean everything. If the person he's talking about isn't a phony, they're a jerk, or some other demeaning title he plants on them. Everything is lousy, or kills him, or drives him crazy, or is depressing.This book was lousy, it really was. I sort of hated it. It was depressing and it drove me crazy just reading it. Although it was painful to read, I trudged through it to the end because I thought it just had to get better and maybe, just maybe there was going to be an actual point to the story... Nope!Honestly, if I had been assigned this book to read in high school, I would have been running out and grabbing a copy of CliffsNotes Coles Notes (as we had in Canada) to get me through this."
847,Tami,I read it because it's one of those books you are suppose to read- but I didn't like all the swearing and his constant pity party! 
848,Saddam Bouchaib,Just finished my first 100 books...... :D 
849,Alan Torres,"I remember reading this book in high school and being excited to read it because it had so much infamy from being banned from a lot of schools to it being in the hands of Mark David Chapman after murdering the late great John Lennon. I also heard it was a classic and groundbreaking and all that jazz. Wow, was I incredibly disappointed and absolutely pissed. I couldn't believe how this book and its main character annoyed the hell out of me. Holden is probably the only character in literature that I absolutely hate. He's annoying and a whiny ass. I don't understand why this book is so popular and how so many people give it so much praise. There's really no point to the story or plot and the main character is just an absolute phony."
850,DB,"I read this for an english lit class in high school and absolutely hated it. I thought it was boring and pretentious then. I have no idea what I'd think of it now, but I don't intend to read it again. That's the impression that it left. Blah! Heh."
851,Jay Ant,"Every famous killer has a copy of this. It speaks to you. If it weren't for such myths, I would have missed out on this repetitive and unrealistic book that in no way deserves its status. This is what happens when you let other people think for you. Some English wonk gets obsessed with a piece of shlock, makes his students read it, and until the end of time, the drones claim it is literature. I'm thrilled that elitists continue to lose influence in most areas due to the widespread availability of information."
852,Elanor,"Tried to read it 3 times, never made it quite far. First of all, the language - which also means I can't read Trainspotting and a few others. It makes my reading incredibly frustrating. Secondly, as I mentioned somewhere else I HATE 20th century white male angst (The Stranger by Camus, or The Man Who Wasn't There by the Coen brothers), and the same goes for its adolescent version. I intensely disliked Holden Caulfield and his faux angst, self-pitiying whiny voice. He was just a waste of oxygen in my opinion. Either go DO something, FEEL something other than your navel, or do us a favor and jump off a building. I have no patience for you. "
853,Maia,"I tried really hard to like this book; all lot of people recommended it to me, but I just couldn't get into it. I don't know why everyone says Holden is ""cute"" and ""likable"" and ""rebellious"". I found him insipid, vapid, and unbelievable. I think I missed the climax somewhere along the way... or maybe there just wasn't one.Why a book about a drunk boy who likes only his little sister, written by a man so pedantic he feels the need to insert ""goddam"" in every sentence is a classic and taught in schools is absolutely beyond me. Perhaps Salinger now lives like a hermit in Cornish NH out of shame because of the rag he wrote in 1951. Something else I realized: as I read this, I got the feeling that Salinger tried to squeeze every single inappropriate thing he could think of into his book. I mean, there's smoking, underage drinking, explicit language, suicide, bullying, acne, pedophilia (was Salinger trying to immortalize himself), running away, etc etc.Also, it was hard to miss Salinger's praise of himself at the beginning of the ""novel"": Holden's brother DB wrote a great story called ""Goldfish"" (or something along those lines) and Holden goes on and on about how it's so great. And it just so happens that Salinger's first literary success was a story called ""A great day for bananafish"".To end my rant: don't read this ""book"" written by a misanthropic, pedophiliac (if Salinger saw a woman he liked on TV, he would write her a letter in the hope that she would get into bed with him), self-obsessed man."
854,Joseph Gonzalez,Sucks 
855,Piscesrenewed,HATE this book - I don't understand why everyone raves about it - the only good part was the bit about the catcher in the rye
856,Giedre,"The first time I read The Catcher in the Rye, I was fourteen and it was a Lithuanian edition. I was not impressed. I thought I'd give this another chance - I had time today, it's not a huge book, so why not. Right. I'm still not impressed. I think you either identify with Holden or you don't. I don't. The Catcher in the Rye is Holden, and he, I'm afraid, is a [insert your preferred insult here]."
857,Alicia," I think you need to a 12-16 your old boy to enjoy and appreciate this book. Not a winner for me.I just could not relate, sorrry I really wanted to love it. It is a classic after all."
858,Mary Kenyon,"There are some books everyone should read. This is not one of them. It was chosen as my book club book or I wouldn't have kept reading it. As it is, I made it all the way to page 57 before I just got disgusted with the language and the pointlessness of it all. The narrator is an annoying little prig.I read this at age 16 and didn't like it much then. I like it even less now. I could easily finish it in another hour, but why bother? There are too many good books out there calling my name."
859,John Boettcher,"Again, one of the worst books I have ever read. I cannot believe that they make kids read this book in lit classes. There are so many other decent books out there besides this crap to read it's ridiculous. I can't say strongly enough how pointless and worthless this book is. I had nothing against it going into it, but it fell way below my expectations. I will never read another Salinger book again for the rest of my life. If I was stuck on a desert island with only Salinger books to read, I would burn them for fire to cook my coconuts and keep me warm at night. That's how bad and pointless this book is. "
860,Dusty Folds,"I heard a man once say that this was his favorite book as a boy but now he really doesn't like it. I can totally understand. This is a novel specifically designed for teenage boys. The protagonist's surly angst might speak to a young audience, but it did nothing but anger and frustrate me. Probably the most I took from the book is further proof that I chose correctly when I decided not to be a high school teacher. Encountering students like this would be my own version of hell. I am thankful that I was never required to read this book in school (even though I might have connected better with it at that time). To paraphrase a repeated line from the story, this book depressed the hell out of me. I was also bothered since it has been heralded as such a monumental work of literature. I cannot agree with that sentiment at all."
861,BikerDude,"Twice in my reading life I've read this book. First time i did so i threw the book in trash (before recycling came along). 20 or so yrs went by snd i thot mebbe i was wrong as it makes all the All-timer book lists. Second go-round had same conclusion cept it went in recycle bin. They keep shoving this book down the throats of impressionable hi schoolers. No telling how many young people this book turned away from reading. I was certainly one of them. It took me 10 yrs post hi skull & college english classes to voluntarily pick up a book. I did so only because i was in the hospital post-op and wasn't interested in daytime soaps or game shows. And what as that book? Can't recall title but it was a Danielle Steele book! Oh! There're books with storylines, plots and characters one roots for? Who knew? That was the only Steele book i've ever read. But i thank her for getting me started on my reading life. "
862,Robert J. Roland," (Warning Major spoiler alert! If considering reading dont read this review.)The book the catcher and the rye was HORRIBLE. That kid must've been demented. I mean seriously Holden is kicked out of so many schools and runs away. Honestly that makes no sence. All he does is focus on the negative. Bet he wouldn't have left If he was thinking positivly about his school, H\his life and such. Not only that but the Holden gets beat up and robed by a pimp and the pimps girl. Wouldn't have happened if he hadn't had run/ran away. And to top it of, he meets a girl that he proposes to after one date. Honestly that makes Holden a creeper. In my oppion this book was complete garbage because he was a winey negative loser who runs away from his problems. He really needs to grow up."
863,Britany Bracewell,This is probably one of my least favourite books in existence. I wasn't even forced to read it in school I chose to read it. Big mistake. The plot is boring the main character is whiny and irritating. I just can't explain my hatred for this book. 
864,Tori Jo Lau,"I couldn't stand the protagonist, and I was bored through the entire book. It's difficult to get into a book when you just don't care what happens to the lead character. I have no idea why I bothered reading it all the way through."
865,Nalee,This book sucks . I don't like it . At the beginning it was quite interesting then as you go on it just gets boring and annoying. 
866,Lisa Howe,"Personally, I did not enjoy this book. There was no plot, and no real purpose; just a long ramble about Holden’s not-so-exciting journey through New York. The only thing I did like was the whole mystery behind why Holden was in a mental hospital, but even that wasn’t very interesting. Also, Holden really annoyed me with his constant criticism and hypocrisy. I mean, I guess that was meant to be the point (that he was just as “phony” as the people he despised), but I really did not like him."
867,Grettel,"I more that ""didn't like"" this book, I absolutely hated it. The summer that I read this book was dreadful, because reading this made me want to slit my wrists. It's well written, but the subject matter is utterly depressing and I found none of the characters likable or relatable."
868,Rebecca Joseph,"I hated this book with a passion. When I started the book, it was with the highest expectations. A few who had spoken to me about the book admitted to loving the character of Holden Caulfield. To me, it seemed like he tried so hard to be a rebel, he became a nuisance who, despite his claims that ""I'm quite illiterate, but I read a lot,"" is so pessimistic he proves a nuisance to everyone around him as well.The protagonist shows no growth or development throughout the book. In fact he seems to show very little progression from his emotional state at the beginning. It seems a pointless novel that tells a story of a boy's somewhat tedious antics in New York. This is one of the most exciting cities in the world and Caulfield finds a reason to be wearily lugubrious around every street corner.It is my belief that J.D. Salinger caught a lucky break in getting this book published. I honestly don't understand how anyone enjoyed reading this, or saw any point to the story. And if they did, I would be very interested to know what they absorbed from it at the end?For me, any book, whether excellent, mediocre or awful has the power to teach us something new. And what I unearthed was my lack of respect for such a character, by which I mean any person who succumbs to his emotions so easily that he retreats deep inside himself preferring to view the world through a peephole rather than as it truly is."
869,Steven Walters,"I don't know what was so gorgeous about this book, I really don't. To tell you the truth I thought it was goddamn crummy. Reading it depressed the holy hell out of me, it drove me crazy. It really did. "
870,Najihahrosdi,Never have I ever read something so repulsive as this book.I'll make this one simple. The writing is good but god do I hate the protagonist. He is such a sour and depressing teenager. There isnt one moment from this book that I ever came close to find him likeable. I hate his characterization and I hate his perspective in life and people. So tell me how could I ever liked a book that was told entirely from his point of view?
871,Allison,The kid is a punk and it drove me absolutely crazy. I was so angry by the end of it I wanted to throw the book out the window. I suppose I should rate it with more stars as it was able to get such a visceral gut reaction but I just couldn't stand it. 
872,Keri,"I did not get this book. I did not enjoy this book. I do not recommend this book. A coworker categorizes Caufield as a spoiled prep school brat from Manhattan. This coworker grew up near Princeton so he has more prep school student experience than I but I would agree with his assessment. Another coworker who last read it in high school said it was a life-changing read for him then. Maybe I just don't belong in the head of a 16 year old boy.Plus, I did not like the writing style of this book. I really didn't. (Ugh) And this is a classic...really?"
873,Frankie,"We had to read this book Sophomore year of high school. I'm really not a fan of this book.Holden Caulfield is a really sad and depressing character. Not only did the book depress me, but I was bored the entire time. Having to not only read but analyze this book was a huge pain, and I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
874,Conor O'mahony,Absolute rubbish. Meandering drivel with no purpose. It is a long time since I have been so disappointed in one of the literary classics
875,Jamie Dennett,"CLASSIC.I decided to read this book as my mum suggested it to me, and I had nothing else to read.A character that I found interesting, is Holden Caulfield. Not in a good way. I found him interesting as he is an extreme protagonist and seems to have a morbid view on the world, and seems to think he is too smart for everyone.My favourite quote from this book is ""I'm quite illiterate, but I read a lot."" because he sounds like Dewald.Something I learned from this book is that teenage boys can have mini ""mid life crises"". "
876,Sarah Williams,"I hate this book so much. The characters, the narrative and the lack of plot ruined it for me. Sorry. "
877,Audrey,"Why is this considered a classic exactly? I felt like I was reading a teenage blog of whining angst. And don't even get me started on the insufferable and overused expletives. Ok, we get it, you think you have to curse in every sentence because you're a bad ass. Seriously, don't waste your time."
878,Michellena,"I went to school with whiny teenage boys, I had (at one time, he's great now) a whiny teenage boy. I don't want to read about one. I think I'm past this classic."
879,Jemila,"Although a treasured classic, 'The Catcher in the Rye' is what I deem to not be worthy of that title. The useless plot, and unlikeable characters make for an extremely poor read. Never have I read a book so utter demoralising to my intelligence. From the outset, Holden Caulfield, swears his way through life, ambling from one pointless thing to the next. The blurb is non existent and now I understand the reason why. No one in their right mind would pick up this book and read it through choice. I would not even give this book to charity because making someone suffer the way I did in GCSE is not what I want to have on my conscience. By all means, if you would like to die of boredom or test my opinion, go ahead. But believe when I tell you, you WILL regret it. Well, that's if you're one of the unlucky ones that manages to read till the end. "
880,Carlos Burga,"Despite the great theme that Salinger uses in this book, and the positive influence that it has had on a number of people that I know, I did not enjoy this book at all. Though I could understand and sympathize with Caulfield’s dissatisfaction with everything that surrounded him, reading the book was almost painful for me. The cause was easily identified as Salinger’s prose, which he deliberately made to appear that of the protagonist itself. As such, the prose was incredibly repetitive and some of its phrases came to be extremely annoying. I can understand Salinger’s attempt, and applaud his success, at an honest portrayal of a teenage boy that is dissatisfied with the world and who cannot seem to find a way to deal with it; however, I could not stop being irritated by his tone and rhetoric. If I can be so bold so as to recommend a book that deals with this theme, also from the perspective of a student, but in a much better way, in my opinion, I would suggest “Beneath the Wheel” by Hermann Hesse. "
881,Barry,I didn't get all the teenage angst from this book. Most of the people that I know who read it either loved it or hated it. I'm in the latter. It was very tedious to say the least. 
882,Alan Martin,I know this may sound stupid and childish but I just didn't get it.. I hated the protagonist and when I hate the main character I find that the book begins to annoy me..
883,Miriam Joy,"Note: I read this in July 2013; I'm only reviewing it now (March 2014) because I'm bored and procrastinating and my hatred of this book just swelled up inside me like my lifelong disgust when faced with mushrooms of any sort. Because I also really hate mushrooms. This book, and mushrooms. Ugh. The description of this book plays up its status as a Classic -- probably because that's the only reason anybody in their right mind would force their way through it. And they make it sound like Holden's a role model or worse ... a halfway interesting character with some sort of personality. When actually, he struck me as something of an idiot, and I hated him. I'm not a particularly violent person (that's a total lie but we'll roll with it) but I very much wanted to strangle him.Cynical adolescent? Frustratingly dull and pretentious adolescent, more like. The only reason I dragged myself to the end of this book was because I was reading it for school, and I regretted it. It was a depressing experience that made me feel even more miserable that Holden himself. By about twenty pages I wanted to murder him, shred the book, and never have anything to do with it again. If I hear the word ""phoney"" (or phony or however the hell it's spelt) one more time, I will scream. The ending is inconclusive and the character doesn't develop or grow in the slightest. And before you start telling me I didn't understand the book, I get that that's the point. But I don't want to read a book that miserable. Books are meant to tell you that you can overcome those monsters, climb over those barriers, and get better. Not to tell you that you're gonna be stuck in a rut for the rest of your life like Holden -- that's what reality does. I don't need that in fiction.It's dull. It's annoying. But most of all, it is so mind-numbingly depressing that I felt utterly miserable by the time I got to the end and it totally ruined my ability to enjoy anything until I'd finished it and made the decision never to go near it again. Just ... ugh. I think I spend too much time with irritating, perpetually adolescent teenage boys who are immature and pretentious -- I don't want to spend an entire book in the head of one of them, because they're probably my least favourite kind of protagonist. So yeah. Really not a book I got on very well with. "
884,Trang Hoang,"Not sure I understand or appreciate the hype of this book. Maybe you have to be in a certain frame of mind like Mark David Chapman, Robert John Bardo or John Hinckley, Jr. or some angst/confused period of your life to 'get it'. I felt like it just ended. I like the childhood innocence/truthfulness that the main character alluded to; however, I felt as if he was just as 'phony' as those he complained about."
885,Zac Brodrick,"Honestly, I saw no point to this book. The main character was an idiot kid with a bad mouth and no purpose in life. The entire read, I kept thinking it was going to get better! It didn't"
886,Stephen,Yuck!I have to say that this book is one of the worst I've ever read. Where's the plot? The book is a series of flashes of nothing
887,Sarah Corcoran,"I didnt get it. Maybe that makes me thick. If it does, by the end of this book I simply did not care anymore. In fact it actually made me feel like my brain was dribbling out of my ears. I spent the whole time I was reading it waiting for something to happen. Nothing happened. Don't read this book. It's a waste of time. Or do. What do I know? I'm obviously pretty thick."
888,Mathew,"This is a terrible book. Unfortunately, I am only one of three people in the known world to believe this. My only guess is that I read this book too late in life....my twenties. Just hearing the title of this book or the name of its protagonist makes me cringe."
889,NatashaSonya,"I've spoken to people who have already read this book, and to be honest, I can't see how they could possibly like it. Perhaps it's because I was forced to read it in English class, but I hated it so much that near the end, I forced myself to speed through the reading a bit. And I was so relieved it when we were done, I could've jumped up and yelled, ""Free at last!"" I'm a fair reader too - I try as much as possible to get into the story of any book I have to read in English class, and for The Outsiders, it was great. Obviously it didn't happen for me here.Holden? He can go shove it. He frustrated me to no end, and his thoughts and opinions were uninteresting, bordering on annoying. The point of the story seemed pointless. The characters all spoke pretty much the same way, and in an irritating way at that, and none were very likable. All the symbolism in the story, whether intensional by the author or not, just didn't seem to... hit home with me? The whole book just wasn't interesting, captivating, or intriguing in any way."
890,Oana M.,"A bit disappointing. Still, I have the hunch that this book has the power to speak in different ways, to different people, in different times. Maybe it was just not the right time for me."
891,Jivita,"There must be something wrong with me.... This may be a classic and all, but I really found it hard to finish this book. Holden was really annoying to me. "
892,Hakuna212,"I've given up! Can't really get into it, not 100% sure what it's even about and considering it's in the top 100 books to read before you die category, i wasn't all that keen on finding out why after 4 or 5 chapters. I put it down and have no interest really in picking it back up. That said it is niggling away at me as I almost always see a book through to the end regardless of how I'm enjoying it or not. This could be a first where I don't return to it..."
893,Bianca,"Geezus. One thing that's worse than plowing through Perks of Being A Wallflower is discovering that there exists an older, more distressing piece of literature out there told by yet another emo basket case.Holden Caulfield's capacity to vex readers with his cynicism and ridiculously hasty generalizations is shocking. You won't just want to eye-roll at him, you'll actually want to kick his teeth in. What a jerk. Thankfully, he sort of redeems himself within the last three chapters of the book because these are the only chapters where he doesn't act like a total prick.What's disturbing is the realization that Holden's pessimistic musings come off as a kind of manifesto of a psychopath. It is a little unsurprising that some deranged maniac like David Chapman would misread this bit of fiction and go on to shoot John Lennon. It just seems like the kind of thing that sparks criminal ideas in a weak character."
894,EJD Dignan,"Maybe, short of Dan Brown, the most over hyped piece of crap ever written.Why this continues to make such a deep impression on people completely escapes me. I read it as a teen and was underwhelmed. "
895,Shawna Jones,"Absolutely HATED it. But it's a quick read so if you haven't you might as well, just because it's one of those books that everybody's read. Protagonist is a whiny little snot. Annoying through the entire book. Evokes absolutely no empathy. Bah."
896,Kevin Duncan,"In high school this was a required reading, and I hated every page of it. It was slow, and dull, and no one cares that he made friends with the cab driver. My English Lit teacher was fascinated by the book, and wouldn't stop telling us about how it inspired some lunatic to kill John Lennan, he even passed out copies of the book at his trail. The story took forever to developed, and even when it finally did, it was boring and felt very uninspired. If I could give it a zero star rating I would, I avoid a this book like the plague. "
897,Dulguun,"Can't believe I found this on the top 100 must read books, really can't believe it. This was pretty much a waste of time to read through this book. It is also quite depressing. I don't know, maybe it was supposed to be read only while you're in high school or something. I was disappointed because I expected something better."
898,Janine Holter,"I am at a loss. What in God's earth was the point of this book and WHY is it considered a best selling classic? I held out hope that somehow after slogging through this young man's blathering on that there would be some POINT or MESSAGE of value. I found nothing, other than that I wasted several hours of my life I will never get back. "
899,Tom,"To be honest, half way through this book, I threw it away. Fortunately for me, my lovely wife had the same reaction."
900,Marley Mizell,"I had SO many people recommend this book to me and tell me it was their favorite. I kept reading it and reading it looking for the climax or at least the point of the story. Can someone please explain to me what is so great about this book?! I mean, it's just a spoiled guy who thinks everyone is a ""phony"" or ""lousy"" and the ONLY thing that makes him happy is his little sister and his red hunting cap. "
901,Amro Osman,"The book started out amazingly and grabbed my attention from the first 10 pages, then it was all downhill from there. I did not connect to Holden whatsoever and felt he was a whiny little kid, I understand he's supposed to be all full of hate and such and he's everything he hates in this world but still....No real plot, no real justification why he can't go home (parents can't just throw you away no matter what you do) and he never justified why he was so shit scared of his old man.1 out of 5 would not recommend or re-read"
902,Laurie Dickerson,I honestly didn't like this book if it wasn't for my teacher i never would have finished. In my opinion there are no high point or low points its extremly pointless and uninteresting. My belief is that the only reason this book seems to be a big deal is because he constantly is swearing and is completely insane in a very boring way.
903,Julieta,"A complete waste of time. Can't understand why is this considered a classic, even for American Literature, what is so classic about it? It has no plot, Holden is an insufferable, pissy teenager that pretty much loathes everyone and thinks that he is so much better than anyone else who is either phony or a moron. And what about the freaking obsession with the ducks in the ""lagoon""...The writing style is horrible. Salinger loves to repeat himself and you can find the same sentence even three times in a single paragraph, all-across-the-book. All the swearing, all the times that Holden states that something ""killed him"", UUUGH. Maybe you do need to be an angsty teen to appreciate it, but this is something that I will never read again. It was only 220 pages, thank all the gods for that."
904,Monicabrooks50,Ultimate hipster 
905,Nic Margett,"I can't believe so many people love this book, it's just about the worst book i've ever read. Nothing but a whiney teenage rant. Hate it. "
906,Moriah Writes-a-lot,"I always feel putting a book on my for-school shelf discredits the read in some way because I did not read it of my own accord. This one I did. As usual I am uncomfortable hating classics, sure it is because I am missing something but I did not enjoy this book at all. If Holden repeated everything he said only once then the book might be 10 pages shorter, if he got rid of half of his repeats the book might be cut down by 1/3. Don't hold me to that math, they are tired guesstimates of a math enemy. I enjoy that guesstimates is an actual word and that ""the book might"" ended up perfectly aligned. In some respects I think like Holden in my tangents as seen above but in other respects I can't really see someone really thinking the way Holden does in all his repetitiousness. Truthfully I kept on thinking towards the end that we would find out he had some mild mental condition, but that is probably my ignorance talking, although when I think about it perhaps I might have been subconsciously reminded of my uncle, who repeats himself a lot. Either way I make no claim. I will never look at the word phony the same way again. I am reminded (in Holden style tangents) of when I was little and a table was described as rude in a book I was reading. I was at a YMCA camp and one of the younger staff members looked at what I was reading and asked how a table could be rude. Not knowing but, thinking I did, I explained how if something is rude they are ugly and abrupt and so if a table is rude it does not look pretty. I wasn't to far off until I decided if table could be rude it could be angry and for the next year angry tables and chairs kept popping up in my writing. Phony has developed its own self, much like the table was angry, although it was more elegantly done. Just about the only thing in the story that was elegant. The book had a strong voice, it just happened to be one that make me want to grab the duct tape. I did enjoy the writing style for about the first page before it annoyed me. And yes I am aware my writing is tending towards Salinger's style, it has that tendency whenever I read a book then try to write directly after.I was very disappointed by the ending and I had to re-read the beginning paragraph to realize the book was never going to lead up to a climax, which is what I was expecting. My favorite thing was the short speech about how boring people must all be good whistlers. ""That killed me."""
907,Craig Everett,"Just read Catcher in the Rye again, since my high school age son is required to read it this semester. Last time I read it was in high school, so the memories were vague.To be honest, I really fail to see why this is considered a classic. Stream of profane consciousness is more like it. Completely inappropriate for minors. Main character is a high school kid who smokes, swears, drinks, fails at school and hires prostitutes. This is the stuff English teachers are giving our kids to read?Salinger tries to make Holden Caulfied the archetypal disconnected teenager, but goes too far and winds up with a protagonist that is completely absurd and unbelievable.I think that this may be the most overrated book in history. Made popular in 1951 by the New Yorker crowd who mistakenly feel that shock value equals quality."
908,Angel,"Believe it or not, I didn't read this in high school like most people. I really wanted to love Holden Caulfield, but I just didn't. He was angsty, whiny, and indecisive in all the wrong ways."
909,Martha,"I didn't even finish it. The first thing I disliked was the cursing and the slang, it was way too much. A 16 yr old coming of age is naturally full of angst and frustration, but Holden is intolerable. It's no wonder his parents shipped him off to a boarding school! It just wasn't interesting enough to continue reading."
910,Kona,Half way through I gave up. Holden Caulfied was a whiner. I got tired of him complaining how everyone around him was a fake when he was the biggest faker of all. UGH!! So glad I this wasn't required in my classes. 
911,Martijn Pollmann,"I read this, cause I wanted to read an American classic. As I understand it, this is required reading for most high school English students. I can’t think of a better book to help kids beat their PS4 high scores. It’s a boring story and the main character is a self-involved, borderline Aspergers teenager. Who, like a typical teenager think he knows all.To all kids everywhere who were forced to read this shit, don’t lose hope. There are far better books out there."
912,Denise,I found the main character Holden to be quite off putting because he was so negative towards everything and hated everyone that he came in contact with throughout the story. I have to say it was fairly depressing book and if it had of been longer I probably wouldn't of kept reading.
913,Robert Mooney,"Someone once mentioned that my writing reminded them of Holden Caufield in Catcher in the Rye. I'd heard of this book but somehow avoided reading it until a few years ago. It is dreadful. I gave up half way through. Probably better when you're 15. If it's masturbatory angst you're looking for, I'd recommend Portnoy's Complaint instead. "
914,Courtney Smith,A total waste of my time!
915,Erika  Forth,"I finally read this. I hated it. Boring, boring, boring. Holden Caulfield is self-involved, shallow, and I could not find one thing to like about him. I have no idea why this character is put on a literary pedestal. I really found nothing of value in this classic. I would much rather teaching John Green's Looking for Alaska. It's got the same themes and yet that one is actually interesting, fun, and relevant. This one sucked."
916,Sadaf Matinkhoo,"I wrote the review below when I read the book a while ago. Now, after watching a documentary about Salinger, I need to add some stuff. My conclusion from the documentary is that Salinger was an arrogant pedophile, at least according to today's norms! Before, I thought Holden was a sweet boy who appreciated children's innocence, but now he disgusts me. I hate what I now know about Salinger, which is basically mirrored in Holden, and I still don't get why this book has been life-changing for so many people, and why would anyone want to kill people after reading it (yes, it has happened, three times!!!). Old review: I honestly don't understand why this book is so popular!!! Sure it's interesting, but what exactly is the big deal about it?!I liked Holden (the main character), the sweet innocent teenage boy with a big old soul who loves children and is annoyed by almost everyone else because he thinks everyone is corrupted in one way or another, except for children. I enjoyed following his thoughts and getting to know him. However, this book is definitely not one of my favorites."
917,Irene (thefictionthief),"I found Holden Caulfield to be a highly frustrating character, what with his constant annoyances with other people and the way he called every second person a 'phony'. The writing itself was very unusual, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but i often tired of hearing the same phrases and idiosyncratic expressions written over and over again. Not too sure why it's deemed to be such a 'classic' novel. "
918,Licia,"I know there are people who thought this book changed their lives and helped them find their unique way in the world, but coming from a non-white, non-middleclass background, as a kid, I really resented having to read about this spoiled, screwed up, white, rich kid who kept getting chance after chance and just kept blowing it because he was so self-absorbed and self-pitying. I felt at the time there was no redeeming value in it for me. I was born on the outside trying my best to get in. I felt no sympathy for him at all. I didn't even find him funny. It just made me angry. I guess it still does. "
919,Patricia,"I have tried several times in my life to read this book. I've yet to finish it, finding the central character obnoxious (fault of adolescence?) and the prose boring. Do not understand the popularity of this book."
920,The Subway Reader,"JD Salinger passed away recently. His literary legacy is very visible in the bookstores in New York nowadays and this week the Morgan Library displayed some recently acquired letters of JD Salinger. Apparently the Morgan has chosen to place those letters in the same room as the Gutenberg bible. So valuable are they. Why? God may know... Salinger is mostly known for The Catcher in the Rye, an absolutely mediocre book. Mediocre is actually an understatement. It is absolute crap! When I read it and I told a friend that I did not like it he advised me to read Franny and Zooey. Apparently much better. Go away. It is even worse. Absolute shite as they say in Ireland. Why these books are classics is completely beyond me."
921,Sirena Ross,"Kept waiting for him to DO something. But Mr. judge-y pants just ran away from any situation where he would be tested. I wanted to smack him about, not to teach him a lesson, just for fun."
922,Madeline,"I read this as a teenager and as an adult. It had nothing to offer either of us, so I burnt my copy on the fire which was the most satisfying thing this book has done for me. I think people can't get over the bluntness of Holden. What I wanted to know was to what end? None. Hence pointless."
923,Noor Alsajan,"Plotless and redundant. I'm pretty sure the protagonist is autistic, I would have liked the book more had the author expressed that. "
924,Olivier Delaye,"One of those ""masterpieces of literature"" that are so lost on me they'll never find their way back on my bookshelves, poor things..."
925,Perkins Mb,"Can I be the only person on the planet that can't stand this book? Maybe I've missed something, I must have missed something... it's just so very... whiny. yuck."
926,Hamish,Overrated 
927,Brenae,"I would have given this book zero stars if it were possible. I couldn't stand the main character, Holden. His selfish, bratty attitude was not amusing. I don't understand how this book is considered a ""classic"". "
928,Memo,"Bought this when John Lennon was killed to see what motivated someone to commit murder. I have to agree that it can, as I was seriously motivated to murder the author - if it hadn't been mentioned re J Lennon, I doubt it would have made it off the shelves. Utter blandness. A real tragedy that a great musician died because of the warped mind of a madman and a mediocre author.I am so sad for those from America that HAD to read this diatribe of bland. I would have downright refused and happily done the detention. This is a fine example of some third rate academic promoting a third rate author to try and turn a third rate book into a classic - not even Harry Potter could magic that up.I do teach my children that books are a treasure and to take care of them - I make an exception for this however and would happily let my children play with this book and a book of matches whilst gleefully watching with anticipation from behind a curtain ;) "
929,Palsay  ,"the book is not that bad so I gave it 1 star. In fact I think it worth 4,5 star. maybe.But I can't do that.I don't like this book. makes me feel depressed.and I hate to know that I used to have horrible thoughts like Holden, this passive-aggressive psycho kid.urgh!"
930,Tiara walls,"Not the worse book I've read but it did nothing for me. Maybe if I read it in highschool I could've found some common ground, other wise I have no connection to the story."
931,Wendy Ding-smith,"I did not care for this book . I was bored and didn't even finish it , which I rarely do. I know its a highly recommended ""classic"" book, but it just did not do it for me. I was very disappointed"
932,Gabe Small,"I think I read this at exactly the wrong age. Old enough to be painfully aware of and embarrassed at my own recent teen angst, but not yet old enough to have escaped it enough to find amusing."
933,Bucephalus,"Holden is the type of person who I want to slap in the face, shake about the shoulders and tell him to ""grow the fuck up"". Maybe I missed something here, it is supposed to be brilliant, it's possible I am a dumb ass, but I hated the book. Just thinking about it pisses me off. Maybe that is its genius, it's a novel Andy Kaufman would be proud of."
934,J.M.,"I had never read this in school, so after Salinger passed away, I thought I'd pick up a copy to see what all the fuss was about. Unfortunately I just couldn't get into it. Maybe it's because I'm in my thirties, but I felt the main character was too whiny and unappreciative of his life. I thought he should apply himself at school more and didn't sympathize with him at all because being kicked out was his own fault. I only got to chapter four or so before I was like ugh, I can't read any more.I might have enjoyed this when I was younger, but I just didn't like it at all reading it now."
935,El Suliman,"Wasn't a fan of the writing style and I absolutely hated the kid. Maybe if I had read this when I was 10-12 I would have really liked it, but I'm not, and I didn't.Just a really whiny annoying kid with a potty mouth. If you took the word Phoney out of this book, it would probably be half the size!Not a fan."
936,Brian Cortes,I found no point to the story.
937,Jana Ada,"Kniha, kterou nejvíc nenávidím. Hlavní hrdina se profňuká příběhem bez stopy sebereflexe a vytváří schematizovaný a zcela nepřesný obraz mládeže svého věku."
938,Christopher Nelson,"I read this novel way too late in life, I believe. My thoughts on it, though, are: Rich boy has first existential crisis brought on by the death of his brother. Whines incessantly. Goes to mental ward. "
939,Alishan,"This was easily the worst book I have ever read. I can't believe the praise this book has received so far. When I started reading, I was hoping to be swept of my feet, but all it did was just worsen my mood every time I opened it ""for chrissake."" Believe me, ""for chrissake"", you see that phrase easily 10 times in each page, and there is no story, to be very honest. It is just ramblings of a cynic who doesn't like one thing in this world. An absolute catastrophe."
940,Christianne,"This is the book that taught me that if you want to punch the protagonist by the third page, you will not like the book. It's not that the book isn't well-written, it must be if it can evoke so much bile. Whining gets you nowhere and Holden takes a very slow train all the way."
941,Constance,"Horrible, waste of my life."
942,Hwee Yee,"I am quite disappointed about the book, considering the fact that it is one of the highly controversial book. I was very eager to reach the peak of the book but there was none. Well, to give it its credit, after reading it and feeling all disappointed, I went and googled for why is it so controversial and turns out that the rebellious teen was supposed to be the cause. But I also understand that this was written in the 50s so perhaps then, it was considered rebellious and angry. While I was reading it, I was referencing to the teenage years of my era and Holden's character was nothing near to be considered as highly controversial. LOL. I didn't like the way it was written though. I hated the way he kept repeating the last sentence of EVERY conversation, no matter who the character was. Things like, ""I swear, you know. I really swear"" or ""I wasn't lying. Hey, I wasn't lying"" and the overly used phrase that ends with ""...and all"" which got really annoying. "
943,Cakes,"Celebrated as a book to enlighten teenagers and supposedly incredibly relateable I was severely disappointed upon reading it.Never at any point did I feel enlightened, never did this help me at all.I read this as a teenager and despite being terribly boring throughout I kept going, hoping I would experience the amazingness. When I was done, I felt deflated. The book did nothing for me. It told me nothing I did not already know.The only reason for my intense dislike is how overrated this is. I can only argue in favour of this story in saying that I was possibly too mature when I read this and could not be told anything new and could therefore not be helped. So maybe this is a great novel that helps the adolescent but I was already way ahead of it."
944,Theo,"This is garbage plain and simple.I read part of the book couldn't finish it because everything about it sucked so much.Holden is a fool, who constantly whines and pisses and moans about everything and never try's to fix his situation.The plot was a jumbled steaming pile.I checked out the Spark notes summary and enjoyed it much more.Aided with the knowledge that someone else suffered through it."
945,Carolyn,One of the worst books I have ever read...
946,Leo Knight,"Based on this book, and one other recently read, I will institute a 100 page rule for myself. If I begin to read a book, and immediately dislike it, I will hang in until page 100. If by that point, the book and I remain out of sync, I will read no further. While reading ""The Catcher in the Rye,"" I almost didn't make it that far.I got annoyed at almost everything about this book. I loathed the main character, Holden. Yes, I'm middle aged, he should get off my lawn, I'm too old to ""get it,"" but even in my teenaged years, I would have thought, ""This Holden is a douche.""I tired of the way Mr. Salinger tries to mimic teen thought and speech after the first paragraph. It reminded me of the times I've found myself trapped in a public place, on a bus, for instance, with a mentally challenged person who latches onto me and proceeds to tell me some rambling, endless tale of woe. Finally, and completely nit-picking, but when did we start spelling crummy with a ""b?"""
947,s,"my hatred for this book has gone far and deep for almost a decade, and i can barely explain why. maybe because it has become cliche, or maybe it's because holden is just another example of an indulgent male protagonist, either way, i hope i never have to teach it to a class. "
948,Psychxpathis,"I suppose I waited too long to read this book. I think if I was slightly younger/ had a different mindset at the time or if I read at the time it was written/released, I might of felt different about this book. I have to say though, I'm disappointed I thought this book would be full of surprises but it wasn't, it was normal?(probably the most annoying thing about reading mainstream books. )this is probably the first book where I've felt that I don't really connect with. I mean yeah sure the world is full of phonies but that's life. but for some reason I could not put the book down. even when Holden was rambling, he rambled on for just the right amount of time? how? I don't even knownot sure where I'm going with all of this, it's an annoyingly average-but-not-average book. I've read some reviews that have praised this, I can't help thinking that I'm missing something here? all I got was annoying, pessimistic possibly abused 16 year old that has lost grip on his life. whether he actually got a grip on it is something I'm unsure about. the last sentence makes me uneasy. ""Don't ever tell anybody anything. If you do, you start missing everybody."" I may reread this one day, I may not. I'll see."
949,Nancy Rector,"Ok... I made it just about halfway through and had to bail. This book sucked. Maybe I'm not a deep enough thinker or something but I couldn't find much of anything redeeming in it, at least in the first half. Wasn't even that well written. I couldn't tell from the first half why this book would be banned either unless it was one of the firsts to use curse words. Not even bad ones at that. I need to read up on the controversy surrounding this book. Maybe THAT will be interesting. Book sure wasn’t. "
950,Jason DeJohn,Get the feeling this book would have meant more to me in my teens. Read half the character is lost and I don't get the sense he ever pulls himself out of the funk he's in.
951,Pen-rye-n,"Like so many other kids in America, and for all I know, across the world, I was forced to read this book back in school. I hated it. I loathed every minute in class that was devoted to discussing Holden Caulfield and his phony life. ""You just don't get it!"" People would insist. ""You don't understand Holden!""After years of going into tirades about how much I despise the little bastard and being shunned for it (""YOU DON'T LOVE Catcher in the Rye? What's WRONG with you?"") I decided, quite unwillingly, to give ol' Holden another shot. Maybe I didn't have enough angst to appreciate it at the time, I thought. Maybe I just didn't comprehend how GREAT Salinger's work was because I was too young and immature. Maybe the teacher drilled everything into our heads so much, I put up a mental block around it & projected the hatred I felt for that sadistic teacher on to poor Holden.So I reread it. And I still feel the same.And I get it, I really get it. Holden is everything he hates in everyone else. He's a hypocritical, phony, crumby bastard and repetitive. GOOD LORD IS THE BOY REPETITIVE. So many times I wanted to reach into the pages, grab the kid by his collar and shake the ever loving piss out of him, screaming ""GET TO THE POINT, MAN!"" I wanted to throw the book as far as I could and leave it there to rot, but I forced myself to finish it so I could at least say ""Hey, I tried it again. It's not my cup of tea"" before I launched into one of my old Holden tirades every time someone brought it up.People worship this book. Whole religions could be built around the folks that think Catcher in the Rye is the greatest thing that ever happened to literature and that's great. That's fine. Maybe I'm an unenlightened fool who thinks I get it, but I don't really GET it. Maybe I just see Holden for what he is: a little creep who needs to get cold cocked AGAIN.And if we ever figure out a way to pluck a character from the pages of a book, the line to hit him starts behind me."
952,Jeremy," holden caulfield felt to me as if emo and goth somehow had a child that was even whinnier and brattier than the whole. Go write about it (or in the instance such as this were they became demi-gods of fic-lit, DO NOT WRITE ABOUT IT), or see a therapist.....I feel better--now you try."
953,Helen Hammer,"I made it to page 12. With so many brilliant and inspiring books in this world...why read this one? The writing was filled with profanity, and this book's protagonist is not the kind of individual who I want to spend time listening to their thoughts. Don't waste your time! "
954,Alyscia,There's only one word for this book and that is terrible. It seemed like the book didn't have any plot and was really hard for me to get into. I honestly have no idea how people consider this an American Classic!
955,Shahad Al Melhem, Ive read bad books but Ive never felt absloute hate towards a novel before. This book is not only boring but very irritating too. 
956,amine,"""Coming of age"" literature ?I found this book at my boss's library while doing an internship for university in 2008. I kindly asked and got it, that is, I was thinking this will blow me away.Turns out it's just a teenager whining about his shit life. Couldn't even finish the damn thing."
957,Aldean,"My response to this book was deep in my gut: I despised it. I came to this book with huge expectations; this is a classic, so I assumed it would be profound in some way. What I got instead was faux-juvenile twaddle. I distinctly rememeber reading the final page, closing the book, and then holding it at arm's length as I decided which corner of my tiny bedroom I would hurl it into. Of course I didn't ultimately throw it (I venerate books as objects too much for that), but I will certainly never bother reading it again."
958,Riley,Utter garbage and I hated it. Prosaic writing and a story that tells of a whiny brat that wants to bone his sister made me want to kill this book. 
959,Natan,"Not a good book at all. No point, no real plot. The only good thing about the book is that it doesn't have a sad ending."
960,Kathryn Lilly,Don't get it..dated book about teen-age angst.. not to mention problems of being rich and privledged... I don't know what all the fuss was about..
961,Nakeisha Campbell,"This book is extremely overrated. Firstly, Holden is the type of character who doesn't want to help himself, so it's hard to believe that there's hope for him once the novel is finished. The story sort of comes back full circle, except I expect Holden to make the same mistakes all over again. I didn't notice much (or rather any) growth in his character throughout because he consistently complains and blames everyone else for everything.Secondly, his thoughts were almost torture for me to read. Okay, yeah, you want to be a kid forever. You hate everyone else and think that they're such phonies (even though you're the biggest phony of them all). I get it.Third. Perhaps this is such a big 'classic' because it gives readers a chance to relate to an immature, troubled and boring teenager. There's absolutely nothing to learn from it, really, and I just couldn't sympathize with Holden. I didn't find his character interesting at all, and by the end I felt like strangling him. Perhaps if he had the guts to grow up and make something of himself, then I'd have thought differently."
962,Steve Conway,"I read this book 3 years ago. I couldn't stand Holden. Had such high hopes for this book but I found Holden to be a real prince and the plot to be boring. He reminds me of some people I know (pesimist who love to blame others for everything that goes wrong...never once taking alook at them selves). Now a days, he would have been prescribed some anti depressants to combat his attitude (was he bi-polar). Worth the read so that you are in the loop on all the references that seem to have worked their way into pop culture, but not a worthy of all the hype. I found it very anticlimatic. I kept waiting for something to happen. Beacause of this book i am not sure i will read anything more by this author. "
963,Floyd,"I was very diappointed with this book, mainly because it ranks among the most overhyped books of all time. I was expected to read a book featuring great characters, an incredible plot and entertaining twists and turns. ""The Catcher in the Rye"" has none of that for me. Boring read."
964,Tadiana ✩ Night Owl☽,"This is one of those books that either speaks straight to people's hearts or leaves them completely cold. I'm in the latter camp: I found nothing in this book that moved me, or struck me as significant, or any way changed my life. I was annoyed by everyone and everything in this book, start to finish.But then, I was one of those bookworm, straight-A, goody-two-shoes teens who never got into any significant trouble or had any really major angst, other than getting teased by the cooler kids at school. Which was stressful for me, but not, I think, the kind of life stress this book is dealing with. So I respect that this book has been vitally important to a whole lot of people, but all it did for me was waste a few hours of my time."
965,Chris Garland,"One of the worst books I have ever read. I actually read the last 1/4 via sparknotes and I'm glad I did. A boring min character who bitches about absolutely everything, while never actually doing a goddamn thing."
966,Veronika Divis,"What is the life of an uncaring teenager? The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger is a book about just that. The story takes place in New York after the main character, Holden Caulfield, gets kicked out of school. I read this book because my group chose it as our group novel. The story starts off with Holden in his dorm, and his last days at his school, Pencey. Holden goes to New York before facing his parents about his dropout from school. He goes to various bars and parks and contemplates his childhood. His depression shows his experiences in a different view than most books. The one person he really likes is his sister, Phoebe. Phoebe shows Holden that you can be responsible and grown up and still have fun (like the carousel).I didn’t really like the ending because it felt like there should be more to the story. I am happy that Holden is finally getting some help for his depression and that he was finally happy when Phoebe was on the carousel. He felt some emotion for the first time. My favorite part is at the very beginning when he forgets the fencing equipment on the subway and is standing all alone on the top of the hill. I like this part because it funny to imagine Holden fencing and enjoying it, because he hates everything. Personally, I did not like this book. I found it very boring because Holden does the same thing over and over again. If he was a real person, I wouldn’t want to be anywhere near him. I honestly haven’t read any books that are like this except It’s Kind of A Funny Story by Ned Vizzini because both characters go through depression and alcohol problems. However, I enjoyed Vizzini’s book a lot more than The Catcher in The Rye. I think teenagers who are interested in the life of students who dropped out of high school, or who themselves have dropped out of school should read this book. "
967,Beth,"forced myself through the first chapter and then said forget it - didn't want to waste my time on it. horrible language, etc. "
968,Kerri,"Ah, it becomes clearer, almost daily, that I lack the interest in nodding along with the masses who proclaim classics as perfect examples of literary excellence. I completely disliked this novel, and to say that Holden Caulfield captures being sixteen in astounding clarity and is in some way a fantastic bildungsroman, is like saying that Anastasia Steele is a great role model for women. I suspect not having disposable amounts of cash, or a burgeoning alcoholic problem, may have created a void preventing me from ever identifying my sixteen-year old self with this self-absorbed waspish creation. This was an absurdly underwhelming novel and the most boring thing I've read in YEARS. I may have been irritated to wrath by Something Red, but at least it was still something, it had a purpose and a story to tell. I actually made up a drinking game to make my way through the novel and by using every instance of ""phony"" and ""goddam"" I was pretty slaked and my moscato was all gone.But, in all fairness, I can't stand books about nothing - it's not everyone's cup of tea but I guess it has its merits. To me it all feels a bit too phony :) and I can't bear to waste my time like that."
969,Jesse Colton,"I now present to you: the condensed version of The Catcher In The Rye, by J.D. Salinger.(view spoiler)[Holden is at school. He walks around and hates everything. Holden takes a bus home, and he hates everyone on it. Holden doesn't want to go home because he hates it there. Holden goes to his teacher's house, who he hates. He spends the night at his teachers house thinking about how much he hates things. He wakes up in the middle of the night with his teacher trying to molest him. Predictably, this causes Holden to hate him even more.Holden sneaks out the window and goes to find his little sister at home, who he kind of hates less than other people. The two of them walk around the city and go to the park. She talks about stuff, and he thinks about how much he hates everything she says. During his deep thought about how much he hates things, Holden comes up with a bullshit metaphor about throwing a ball in a field of rye at the edge of a cliff with a giant man standing on the other side of the cliff, and no I'm not making that up.Epilogue: Holden is now in a place where they treat depression. He was told to make a journal to help him with it. He hates doing that, just like he hated everything he wrote in this journal, which is this book, that he hates. Also, he intends to hate things more in the future.THE END (hide spoiler)]In all seriousness, though, I read this book when I was exactly the demographic of people who claim to identify with it: I was an angry eighteen year old boy who was a social outcast, and I felt very disabused about the whole world around me. Even then I found Holden to be whiny and caustic. I kept hoping he would be gay and the book would suddenly become interesting, because he seemed really interested in the other male characters in the book, but ultimately it went nowehre and was about 200 pages of one guy complaining. And this is somehow heralded as one of the greatest literary masterpieces of the century, as well being banned because of it's ""explicit content."" The only explicit part of this book was him describing a guy who needed to pop his giant pimples. It was so gross that I still remember it six years later."
970,Suzy,"I read this one a long time ago, and I probably need to read it again because the only thing I can remember is that I didn't really like it. Too depressing!"
971,Annie Brunelle,If I could have given this a zero I would have. Doesn't deserve one star. 
972,Tumelo Mapena,"1. No ways this crap is a classic.2. This kid who hates everyone and everything needs a better reason than ""phony""3. ""I just didn't feel like it"" repeated that many times just says to me this story should never have been told in the first place.4. He doesn't know what to do with his life, understandable. Should not blame the world for it so grow up, understatement (I know).5. Holden, J.D; suck it!"
973,Vincent,"I don't understand why so many people enjoy this book, and its significance in literature. I found a very frustrating read, and could not relate to Holden at all. Just my opinion."
974,Richard Stephenson,"PROS: One, of applicable age, *could* garner some life lessons from the adventures of Holden.CONS: Boring, could have been approximately 2/3 shorter if the tangential stories were attenuated (they didn’t always help character/story progression). Maybe it was Mr. Salinger’s intent, but I was highly annoyed by the arrogant boy who couldn’t meet his own standards. Oh and the term that represents condeming The Creator to hell occurs 255 times in this book. I read this book in High School and listened to the audiobook most recently… it was torture both times.ASSESSMENT: I cringed the entire way through this one and was ecstatic when I reached the end. Would NOT recommend."
975,KaRo,"Zazwyczaj większość ludzi przechodzi w swoim życiu okres buntu, a dzieje się to najczęściej między 14 a 17 rokiem życia (chociaż zdarzają się odchylenia od normy tj. mój nauczyciel od niemieckiego, który twierdzi, że okres buntu nadal przechodzi). Wtedy młody człowiek intensywnie podąża ku dorosłości, oddala się od rodziców w poszukiwaniu szeroko rozumianej wolności, akceptacji, których z jego perspektywy mu brakuje. Tak naprawdę osoba taka potrzebuje zrozumienia, szczerej rozmowy, co pomoże jej odnaleźć się w tej poplątanej rzeczywistości.Holden Caulfield to podręcznikowy przykład buntownika. Zostaje po raz kolejny wyrzucony ze szkoły, czym oczywiście nie za bardzo się przejmuje. Nie interesuje go nauka, więc nie widzi potrzeby jej kontynuowania. Z powodu kłótni z kolegą zamieszkującym z nim w pokoju, chłopak ucieka z placówki kilka dni przed tym, kiedy jego rodzice mają go odebrać. Nocuje w hotelu, kilkukrotnie się upija, włóczy się po mieście, poznaje nowych ludzi, dręczy swoimi telefonami znajomych, spotyka się z nimi, popełnia wiele głupstw, dużo rozmyśla i jednym słowem poznaje blaski i cienie samotnego życia.Jerome Salinger posłużył się w tej książce narracją pierwszoosobową. O wszystkich wydarzeniach opowiada Holden, dzięki czemu mogłam go dobrze poznać, dowiedzieć się, co myśli o niektórych sprawach, ludziach, a co za tym idzie - wyrobić swoje zdanie na temat jego osoby. Myślę, że wybór akurat tego sposobu narracji był najlepszym z możliwych.Jeśli chodzi o język powieści, tu sytuacja wygląda dużo gorzej. Autor użył tylu wulgaryzmów, że czytanie było miejscami męką. Rozumiem, że zapewne miał na celu zmniejszenie dystansu pomiędzy czytelnikami a światem przedstawionym, ale przecież we wszystkim trzeba zachować umiar. Częste zwroty typu: ""Serio."", ""(...) jeśli chcecie znać prawdę"", ""Słowo daję."" po prostu mnie irytowały i ani trochę nie zbliżały do narratora.Akcja w książce jest bardzo powolna. Czasami miałam wrażenie, że zatrzymuje się w miejscu i po prostu przez kilka stron nic się nie dzieje, jednym słowem - monotonia.Główny bohater, Holden strasznie mnie denerwował. Nic mu się nie podoba, jest powierzchowny, zachowuje się jak rozkapryszone dziecko, mimo że ma już 16 lat. Narzeka na świat, ludzi, ogólnie krytykuje wszystko wokoło oprócz siebie, pozostaje biernym obserwatorem i komentatorem tego, co złego dzieje się na świecie (to akurat potrafi dostrzec), zamiast przejść do konkretnych działań, wciąż snuje nierealne plany. Nie sugeruję, że powinien dokonać podboju świata, jak za dotknięciem magicznej różdżki usunąć to co złe, przywrócić to co dobre. Chodzi mi raczej o to, żeby zaczął od zmiany siebie. Niestety Holden nadal upija się, pali papierosy, niszczy swoje zdrowie i popada w coraz większą paranoję. Jedyną rzeczą, którą mi zaimponował, było jego przywiązanie do młodszej siostrzyczki - Phoebe, dla niej był w stanie zrobić naprawdę wiele.""Buszujący w zbożu"" wbrew pozorom nie miał być zbiorem zwierzeń rozstrojonego psychicznie nastolatka, ale pozycją, którą po przeczytaniu trzeba ""przetrawić"", przemyśleć, to zdążyłam zrozumieć jeszcze w trakcie czytania. Z pewnością jest to książka o szukaniu swojego miejsca na ziemi, własnej tożsamości i rozpatrywaniu przyszłości w obliczu teraźniejszości. Szkoda, że wykonanie nie szło w parze z koncepcją, być może inaczej oceniłabym tę książkę, gdyby tak było. W tej sytuacji mogę tylko powiedzieć, że nie przypadła mi do gustu i raczej do niej nie wrócę.Mimo że z lektury ""Buszującego w zbożu"" nie dowiedziałam się niczego nowego, nie odradzam nikomu tej pozycji. Przecież nie wszyscy zinterpretują ją tak samo, czytelnik ""x"" będzie zły, że zmarnował swój czas na takiego ""gniota"", czytelnik ""y"" będzie zachwycony i zechce zmieniać świat, dlatego warto spróbować i przekonać się samemu, jaki jest mechanizm tej książki.http://przyjaciolkiksiazki.blogspot.c..."
976,Zayzay Ben-ami,Nope. Absolutely hated reading this. Another one of those books that you have to soldier on through in school. 
977,Sharon Davies,"As controversial as it may seem, I cannot understand the pull of this book. It was a bit monotonousness, and repetitive....and I know that was the point of the whole thing. The ending was not a 'wow' moment for me, it was more of a 'what' moment. I read the whole book for that. No, I really don't see the fuss around this book. It's over-rated."
978,Vauna Harless,"I have books that I don't care for or that I can't get into, but rarely do I find a book I can say I hate. I have to add this to my short list of hated books..... "
979,Kenneth,"The main character is extremely annoying. He is so winy. I know he went through a lot of struggles but still it's like he doesn't even care about his own life. He just goes around wrecking his own life and leaving a mess in his path. He acts like the most angst kid ever with really even having a valid reason it's not like he was forced to kill his parents or was kidnapped and nearly killed. Phoney this Phoney that. This is a terrible example to give to children in school of growing up, as the main character acts like he is only 4 years old. There are plenty of other books out there that could give a better message than this drawn out garbage."
980,Jade Danielle,I gave this book a new jacket and a more fitting title: White People Problems. 
981,Muhammad Nusair,"Third disappointing book, I am not reading Salinger again."
982,Eric Antwi-agyei,Maybe I guess if I read this in my teens the book would have been more exciting. The BBC made a lot of notice about J.D Salinger when he died so I got his book just out of curiosity. The defining moment for me in the book has to do with the advice from his teacher Mr. Antolini who tries to underscore the importance of education to a teen. I believe students who are disillusioned with school should read this book In the end J. D. Salinger was writing about himself. In real life I read he was a recluse living in a cabin just as his book. 
983,Max R.,"Holden Caulfield is the most irritating, snot-nosed punk I've ever encountered in all of the American fiction I've read -- and I'm 58 years old.I didn't read this piece of crap until a few years ago, after having heard so many sing its praises for decades, and I was totally disappointed. At one point in the novel, a dispute arises between Holden and a young prostitute about the price of her services; the pimp intervenes, and I found myself cheering him on: ""Yeah, Mr. Pimp, hit him again!""I think that the author became a recluse precisely because he knew in his heart that ""The Catcher in the Rye"" was mediocre, at best, and Salinger was profoundly embarrassed by the undeserved accolades.I recommend that you read a comic book, instead."
984,Marie Østvold,"I'm sitting on a patio of an old house, somewhere on the american east coast. It's dusk, warm and a mild breeze. The cigarettesmoke fills the air, and bottles of whisky on the table. Salinger tells his lifestory. This is one of the images I am left with after reading this novel. The other, is that the main character is a real pain. This is one of the novels I have read that irritates me- from the first page, to the last. Even after I closed it and left in on the table afte finihing the last sentence. I go get it- it's supposed to be about adolescense; teenage angst,belonging,indentity alienation and so forth. That the language the books is coloured with, is subjective. It's how teenagers word themselves, and how it really is (or is it?).Which is natural and interesting in a way. The maintopic new and became censored- Holden also became an icon. It's just that Holden was annoing, childish. Too much wining for my laste. I just wanted to take my arm around his shoulders and shake him: Shut up and get your act together! I was sick of reading ' goddamn', and 'it killed/kills me' all the time. Not to mention the whole ducksituation in Central Park. Second, he tries to hard- meaning the author himself. He tries to make Holden universal, but it's just too much. And this makes it all unrealistic. Which ultimately kills the story. But still, I don't really know how to rate it. I really don't like it, it made me upset and irritated for a long time. That should give it a one star- if any. At the same time- does that mean it is well written?? How many books have I been this emotionally engaged with? Hardly any. Does it mean it is suited for a full star rate? It still frusterates me, so I will give it a one. If you want to read it because is a so called 'classic', do it, by all means- full hearted. But there are other classics that are more worthy of your time. "
985,Ahliah Thompson,"I actually was very disappointed in this book. Mainly , because there was no conclusion to the book. The first person narrative was boring, and non intersting. As the reader I didnt feel capativated by the tone of the story either. It wasnt even my usual type of books, but I took the innocitaive and read the book and got the whole opposite of what I thought I was going to get. The author of th ebook didnt really discuss his thoughts fully. He was indisicive, stubborn, hard-headed, and childish. The dialogue of this book was quite boring as well too. I just couldnt get capativated in the book. I wish it was more appealing to me, I thought because it was from a teens perspective , but that wasnt the case."
986,Kathryn Hartzell,"Quite honestly, this is one of the worst books I've ever been forced to read. If it wasn't for the fact that I had to read this for class, I honestly think I would've given it a bath, as I do with other books I hate and do not wish to punish anyone by giving them the chance to read it. The main character Holden, is more whiny than Bella Swan. He is not happy with anything that happens in his life. If something that he wants to happen happens, he finds a way to get depressed by it. This happens countless times, and as a reader, it gets quite annoying. There is no character growth throughout this novel either. Despite the fact that this novel takes place over two days, you'd expect something to be 'life changing' especially considering the title. Honestly, a lot happens. But it's a lot of nothing. You watch Holden go from place to place, being depressed by one thing or another, and then Holden calling someone or something phony. Followed by a memory from Holden's past.There are some things about Holden I find relate able though. The fact that he wants to do something different, and not live the life planned out for him. Some may think he's over exaggerating by wanting to run away and become a deaf-mute. But I think to an extent, he's not. Although as a character I feel Holden altogether is an over exaggerated attempt at teenager. I feel that he is what an adult THINKS a teenager is like. The entire novel I felt like the author was mocking me, and it added to my dislike of the story. There was no description in this story. Even if the story is told in first person, the 'show not tell' rule is still in place. Yet it seemed that this author generally forgot this rule. The only things mentioned were in the negative, and this left me with a very sour taste in my mouth after looking into Holden's world.Lastly, the story just ended. Holden tells you where he goes, and how he ends up in the hospital in about three sentences, and it's over. And if you actually cared enough about Holden to even question anything at this point, you are left standing outside in the rain. Sorry, love, but you get nothing. [Just be happy the book is over.]"
987,Janine,"To say I didn't like it is something of an understatement. I realize this is a classic, but that doesn't mean I have to like it."
988,Gloria Finocchi,"Non è roba per me. Nella migliore delle ipotesi, l'ho trovato irritante. Nella peggiore, pallosissimo. Tanto è vero che l'ho abbandonato a circa 30 pagine dalla fine."
989,Lauren,This is a love-it-or-hate-it book.I could not relate to Holden Caulfield at all. So you can tell what I think of it.
990,Ivan Zhivkov,"The portrayal of a spoiled brat who knows nothing of the outside world. Desperately seeks attention, rather misunderstood at times, and not living up to his family's simple expectations. Depressing book and I don't see the big huff about it. Truly."
991,Pedro Benoliel,"
Everything you ever wanted to know about emo teens, but were too proud to ask.
Have you ever wanted a glimpse at the diary of an emo kid? Well, this is your chance!Meet Holden Caulfield. He's 16, a slacker, and loves to wallow in his white person problems. And in the course of 200 or so excruciating pages, he makes us privy to every single last one of them.Yes, folks, the revered, life-affirming ""Catcher In The Rye"" is little more than the glorified diary of an emo teen, 50 years before anyone even coined the term. The 'plot' of this book basically amounts to 200 pages of nothing much happening, 
while someone whines about nothing much happening
. Holden himself pretty much defines the emo stereotype: he's whiny, entitled, manipulative, lazy, and wants everyone to think he is so cool and deep and tortured, when in fact he is just a spoiled brat who cannot be bothered with anything. He hates his room-mate and his 'friends', but keeps them around just so he can feel popular and well-liked. He whines about anything and everything, while doing absolutely nothing to change his situation. He denounces 'phonies' and thinks himself the paragon of 'genuine' youth, but he fails to see that he is just as bad as those he denounces, with his misplaced angst and faux-blase attitude. In short, he is most of us at 16. And most of us HATED ourselves at 16.I suppose the big question here is: 27-year-old me hated this book with a passion, but would nerdy, maladjusted, awkward 17-year-old me have sympathized with Holden? The answer is probably not. He is a little too close to how I was back then, and my life was plenty miserable enough without needing this idiot's woes piled on top of it. Plus, in true blinkered Holden Caulfield fashion, I would probably have thought he was an asshole - all the while failing to see how exactly like him I was."
992,Brian Yamabe,"Teenager whines about life. I didn't whine this about my youth, why would I want to read someone else doing it. Maybe this was groundbreaking 50 years ago or maybe people enjoy listening to others whine. "
993,Erinlaurel,Too much teenage angst for me.
994,Brianna,This was a pointless book. I kept waiting for it to get better but it didn't. I am very dissapointed with this novel. No meaning whatsoever.
995,Claudia Kieselhorst,"For a book hailed as one of America's favorites... I found this novel revolting.I am a patient and sympathetic reader, meaning I will give any book it's full opportunity to win me over. There have only been two books, now, in my entire life that I have been unable to stomach the thought of finishing: James Frey's A Million Little Pieces, and now Salinger's Catcher in the Rye. There is something about this book that makes me angry. There seems to be this odd bitterness and unnecessary angst smeared on every page. Reading it was frustrating and I found myself wanting to slap the main character and tell him to mind his manners. I'm sure the scholars and educators of our nation have their reasons for incorporating this book into a vast majority of the curriculum, though I can't imagine what that reason could be. It is a celebrated text, though, and for that I respect it's prominence in society and would not necessarily discourage anyone from reading it. However, you will never find me picking up a copy of this book again for any reason other than to swat a fly or stabilize a wobbly table leg."
996,Erin Kristen,"I kept waiting for something to happen, but it never did. I wouldn't hang out with this kid in real life, so why did I read along with him? blah."
997,Susanne,"I was given this as a book when I came to the United States as a 16 year old and told ""Read this and you will know all about US teenagers"" 20 years later and I still don't get this book!"
998,Surenna,"I'm just going to be blunt: I absolutely with all my heart detested Holden Caulfield with every ounce of hate I have in me. I mean, I understand that this kind of character was created on purpose but it made me feel so overwhelmed and stressed out every time I open the book and heard Holden's nasally voice in my head saying ""just for the hell of it"" or ""it depressed the hell outta me"", both of which he said millions of times. Most other teens loved this book saying that Holden was relatable with the way he talked, but to me (also a teen) he was just a whiny, full of angst teenager. "
999,Lauren Shoaf,"This is one of those books I'd always wanted to read and am still not sure how I graduated high school without reading it . . . that being said, reading it as an adult I found it PAINFUL. This is the book I proposed to our Book Club last year, most of the ladies had already read it, but all agreed it would be good to re-visit as an adult. Interestingly, the majority of the group enjoyed it as a teen, but not as an adult. No more Salinger for me."
1000,Susanna,I disliked this book intensely when I read it in high school. Not sure if time will have mellowed my feelings towards it or not.
1001,Bas,"It's really boring. It's written with so many filler words, such as ""umm"" and ""uhhh"" it's like listening to two dopey bitches who won't shut up talk about lipstick."
1002,Jeffrey M,"I was supposed to have read this during high school ""Great American Novel"" class. 10 percent into the book I completely lost interest, and now, having freshly read it in its entirety, realize that I had read it sufficiently for my taste those 35 years ago."
1003,Jade Woodson,"i hate this book. if i didnt have to read it (because my teacher made me) i never would...actually i didnt really read it, because i kept falling asleep. it was so boring and i wouldnt read it again. its not my type... :/"
1004,Mary Ann,"Nope, twenty some odd years after having read it as a Freshman in high school I still don't like this book. I find Holden's negativity depressing and just annoying. Perhaps I'm missing some larger piece of a puzzle."
1005,Hrafnhildur Francis,"I was really excited to start this infamous book that every English teacher drools over, but honestly I don't understand what the fuss is about. It was boring."
1006,Georgia Cromarty,Possibly the most overrated book of all time. I ended it with a feeling of total disappointment and a strong feeling of hatred towards Holden Caulfield. 
1007,Caron,I really didn't enjoy this book at all. Holden was a pain in the backside and the constant use of the word 'goddam' had me tearing my hair out before chapter 2.I read it because I had heard great things about it and working in a book shop I sort of felt that I had to but I was bored and really struggled to get through it.Never before has it taken me 4 days to read 200 odd pages.
1008,Carol,Eee-gads! Maybe I'm too old at 34 to appreciate the dysfunctional attitude of the main character. I found this a tough one to finish. Yuck!
1009,Calimie,"Quite possibly I'm missing the point of the book, but whether I like a book or not depends a lot on whether I like the main characters and, in this case, I couldn't stand the kid: I found him irritating and whinny. I do wonder if this book would be regarded the same way had the main character been a woman."
1010,Trexy,"It is goddamn lousy, corny and damn phony. It makes me sad. It depresses me.- basically what Holden would say about everything, and what I say about the bookI honestly don't know why some people love this book. I think maybe because they can relate to Holden. And there are other people who just see him as this selfish, depressed, annoying boy. I know this is classic because back in the days curse words were kind of taboos. I just don't really like it to the point that I hate it. I tried to finish reading it but after I did, it left me annoyed and feeling like I just wasted a day of my life reading it. But it's just my opinion and people who see the beauty of this novel are lucky."
1011,Mlt205,"I was supposed to read this book in highschool but I was full of teenage angst and rebellion so I never did purely out of principle. Now 12 years later i decided to give it a shot. I do see some of myself in Holden, but I still found this book to be one of the worst I have ever read. With all of the great books both current and classic in the world I do not understand why this book is still around. I do not recommend this book."
1012,Lauren McDonnell,"Terrible. I understand that when it came out, it must have been shocking and revolutionary, a totally new perspective in literature. However, new doesn't always mean good. "
1013,Ngozi,"There are two types of people in this world: those who love Holden, and those who hate him. I am apart of the latter and thus this novel was INCREDIBLY difficult to get through. I made it though, all for the sake of my AP English grade. Take my review with a grain of salt because I just can't stand the narrator. SPOILER AHEAD: Nothing really happens, it's a story of a rich boy getting over his brother's death. Some find it touching, I didn't. Holden's actions and narration wasn't enough to strike a chord in me. You may love this book, many do, but for me (call me a freak): never again."
1014,Aurora Banks,"I thought this book was homorus, if you have a twisted sense of humor, and that like totally bugs me. This book is so.............. There aren't words for such a strong emotion. This book sucks. I hated it so much I didn't finish it. I stopped at page 149."
1015,Haleema ,"Well, this was a pain to get through.First of all, this is a shitty way to start a novel no matter how you want to introduce your main character.If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was born and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth. That is easily one of the saddest, most pathetic introductions to a book. As I started this book, I wondered... if the introduction is like this, how will the rest of the book be?This is what the rest of the book looked like:""He was also the nicest, in lots of ways. He never got mad at anybody. People with red hair are supposed to get mad very easily, but Allie never did, and he had very red hair. I'll tell you what kind of red hair he had."" ""I sort of used to go to Allie's baseball matches.""""It was around ten-thirty, I guess, when I finished it."" Also, Holden thinks everyone besides him is a phony and a moron. And he makes it very clear because he mentions it, like, every two pages. I read some of the comments regarding how I didn't understand this book because I didn't relate to it. That may be true. Very, very true. Regardless, I still think to this day that this book is a drag and has an unlikable main character and a dry writing style. Perhaps I will read it again when I am older and maybe I'll enjoy it."
1016,Bianca Bendix,"I really disliked this book. Not only did I really dislike Holden, I also did not like the way this book was written. Holden is such a negative person and I couldn't I could not handle it. I had to read it for English class this year and I was actually one of the only ones who disliked the book so much, which surprised me. "
1017,Hannah McClure,"Well what a waste of my time, This is officially the worst book i have ever read. I read this for the same reason that everybody reads it. It's supposedly ""the best book ever written"" whoever said this obviously has not read many books. It gives the option at the bottom of the page to ""hide spoilers"" it would be impossible to spoil this for you:nothing happens. I know what you are thinking, that this is my opinion. Well then what i say to you is, a group of my friends, my dad, and me read it at the same time and we all came to the same conclusion."
1018,Jaime Banos,"My god this was a god awful book. The main character just complains the whole time. Had i been in the book i would have smacked him across the head and told him ""Get over it! Life sux! Who cares!"""
1019,Ramona,"Endings are very important to me. And this book didn't have one. I am very picky about this point. I don't want wrapping up at the end, that will make me hate it as well, but I want an author to have something to write about, and there isn't a story here. "
1020,Heather Harris,"I remember reading this in high school and hating it. It's one of those books that I just don't understand why it's considered a classic. The writing isn't anything special and the main character is simply a pessimistic jerk. The book provided no insight into life, humanity, or anything else that would have given the book a point. If I could give it zero stars, I would have."
1021,Britta,"It bulit up and up and up and up an then just ended. There was no climax to the story, it just stopped. "
1022,Flipperty Gibbert,Really not sure what the big deal is about this book. Completely overrated. Boring.
1023,Asorel,"The Catcher in the Rye tells the story of a pessimistic, spoiled, brat who hates everything around him. There is little to no justification for this behavior, and the audience is incapable of sympathizing or understanding the actions of the protagonist. The book's plot is nonexistent; there is no rising tension, no challenge to overcome, no resolution, just a narrative of the protagonist wandering around New York over the course of three days. Character development is also not seen in the book. This may be forgiven in minor characters, as few appear for more than a single chapter, but not in the protagonist. Holden Caulfield is a whiny and self absorbed in chapter one, and continues to act in the same way up to the last page."
1024,Kaitlyn,"I didn't appreciate the overused swearing, but it did a great job at portraying the mindset of someone who has no direction and is troubled at what the world is giving him. Kinda confusing, overall"
1025,Ebba,"Maybe this is one or those books that actually is better if you read it in class and analyse it. Because just reading it as any other book was boring. I know it's supposed to be good so I probably missed the point with it or whatever, but I didn't like it at all."
1026,Liana,"Franny and Zooey made me love J.D. Salinger; Catcher and the Rye made me want to have the man's testicles laid on dry ice until they grew frostbitten, fell off, and could be auctioned off for a children's charity."
1027,Tarek Mallak,"I only continued reading because the book was recommended by a dear friend.It might be talking in the language of the purpose to which it points, but I detested the lack of any aesthetic aspect."
1028,Daniel,"I read this book in high school, then again a few years later. I reread it solely to remember why I disliked it. Basically, who cares about Holden Caulfield? I certainly didn't. By the end of the book I had complete disdain for him and his self-importance."
1029,Missy,"You know, I just never got this book. I didn't like it when I read it in 8th grade, hated it in college and revisited it when an adult and STILL don't get what the big deal is. I find Holden self-centered and a bit whiny, his parents seem cold and disinterested at best and he is surrounded by incompetent adults.. so what. Just can't seem to work it up over this one."
1030,Kevin ,"
FANBOY POV:
Now that's a book you can call a YA book with a YA character that is not hard to find in each and everyone of us. 
CRITIC POV:
I want to really love this book. I really do, but the writing style makes it very difficult for me to do so. THE REVIEW:WRITING STLYE:I understand that the narration of the book is 1st POV, but I don't like that Holden says a million ""phony,"" ""corny,"" ""pervert."" It drove me crazy.PACE:The jump from one scene to another gives me a hug headache. I can't seem to point what is going on where and when. I can follow the story, but the flow of the novel is very hard to absorb. CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT:It's really easy to see why Holden is irritated to some of his dorm mates. Even the minor characters such as the cross-dressing old man, the spitting couple, Maurice from the elevator can seem to stand alone by themselves, and you will see how strong they are inside the novel. What I mean is they have their own powerful story and they have their own story to tell even though the narration is just Holden's. PLOT:What is Holden trying to accomplish in the novel? He looks like he is trying to get company and kill loneliness that he feels, but to be honest, I can't seem to find a linear plot in the novel. I can't find connections of the events from each other. I was already halfway through the book, but I was still asking myself ""when will I see what he is trying to accomplish?"" I feel someone is gonna comment on my review on how stupid I am not to see the plot, but I believe again that the writing style ha a huge influence on why. MY VERDICT:I know this book plays a giant impact on many people. However, the magic did not work on me. I gave it a chance to just let me enjoy the novel even without the ""magic,"" but it did not happen. What I can promise is I am not gonna be like people who hate on Twilight, because I don't hate this book. Hate is a strong word. I won't be like the people who hates Twilight-- they waste time on bashing books. And there is another thing I can promise; I am gonna give this book another chance in the future. I have this feeling that I just did not feel its magic, because I am reading this for school. I am a different kind of reader as a student. RATING BREAKDOWN:WRITING STYLE: NO STAR(S)PACE: NO STAR(S)CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: +1 STAR(S)PLOT: NO STAR(S)MY VERDICT: NO STAR(S)"
1031,Lynsey,"Old Holden's phoney dialogue was god-damn annoying. This is a classic, why? At least I can say I've read it now!"
1032,Jacob G,"You know that one friend you have, the one who every so often will say or do something that makes you think ""God, why do I hang out with this person?"" Well, if Hold Caulfield were my friend I don't think I would ever stop saying that, he is boring, shallow and - just like the book itself- completely overrated. When I first read The Catcher in the Rye in my sophomore english class in high school, I didn't find it nearly as interesting as everyone said it was supposed to be. Recently I found a copy lying around my house and decided to read it again, just to see if there was anything I might have missed. All in all, I found it even more bland and frustrating than the first time I read it. Now don't get me wrong, there's nothing I love more than a good character study, the problem with Holden is he just isn't very interesting or likable. Salinger spent so much time trying to create the most universal character he could that he created one void of any personality or depth and who's to self absorbed to see that he's just as ""phony"" as everyone else, if not more. Because of his lack of self awareness the fact that the story - or lack there of- is told from Holden's and only Holden's point of view, leaves the reader wanting more.In conclusion, The Catcher in the Rye is one weekend I'll never get back. Next time I need a little spare cash and I have to sell a book or two, I'll know which one to reach for first. "
1033,Richard P. Pheneger,"Well, I guess ""you had to be there""...if I had read this book at the same age as Holden Caulfield is in the book, it might have meant a great deal more to me...some people couldn't believe I'd never read it...I don't want to shock anyone, but I found that reading it at my age now...I could care less about the character(s) and I found myself wondering why it made such an impact when published. Dysfunctional families have certainly come a long way since then...I really didn't live an exceptional childhood, it was better than Holden's...my parents were more than supportive...we didn't have a lot, but I never found myself so depressed and without friends and direction as far as what I wanted to do with my life...I'm glad I read it, but not for the reasons that everyone else read it...An interesting sidebar...I'm trying to read everything on my Kindle, but ""The Catcher in the Rye,"" is not available...at least I couldn't find it...whenever I searched for its title...the only things available were five or six different study guides by five or six different authors...maybe we're supposed to read the guides rather than the book itself...not sure it would have made a difference for me...go figure...Thanks to the Stratford Library for the copy I read...now back to my Kindle... "
1034,Fernando Vazquez," Read this last year for A.P English summer homework, and I have to say I have NEVER wanted to bun a book so much than this one. This is the one book all my Friends (in regular, lower leek English classes) that were forced to read and say they liked it because it was the only book they've ever read. Holden was annoying, unrelated to me, personal, or anyone I know. I don't understand the fascination with this book. If you like this book, I can acknowledge you do, but I don't know.....1/5"
1035,Greynomad,Listening to a dialogue of a 16yr old immature teenager is just a waste of time.........
1036,Taryn Wood,The Catcher in the Rye had to be one of the hardest book I had to get into. The beginning of the book was very descriptive don't get me wrong but while reading I felt like my eyes were just scanning over every world not really registering and comprehending what was happening. It was hard for me to really enjoy the novel when the main character Holden was extremely upfront and came off as rude throughout a lot of the story. There were times where he had his moments of weakness and actually said how he felt. I'd recommend this book to people who can easily get into slower books and enjoy not really understanding what's going on!! 
1037,Tyler J. Carlson,Worst book that I've ever read!! 
1038,Amy Wright,"The story begins as Holden has just been expelled. After several negative interactions with students at his school he decides to go stay in hotel in NY. While in NY he explores his sexuality and the reader learns that he is a virgin. He tries to spend time with three women, but is only left with the bill. He then calls a prostitute but feels like she is a person and ends up wanting to talk instead of have sex--as a result he is beaten by her pimp and has to pay more. Through several experiences Holden decides to become the ""catcher in the rye"" which to him means saving children from the evils of the world. When Holden visits a professor he admires his professor gives him advice, but Holden leaves feeling awkward because of an encounter that makes him question if the teacher was doing something homosexual. The story ends a little vaguely with Holden deciding to go back to school with the help of his sister.  I didn't enjoy this book. Holden seemed to be unreliable as a narrator and I found the end to be questionable and inconsequential. Its possible its just not my style of book, I had heard that many people didn't really enjoy it either though. "
1039,Matt Goldstein,"I can't understand what all the acclaim and hype are for with this book. I feel it's an extremely overrated and bland story. It's one of the few books that I've ever just stopped reading after a hundred pages, and admitted and couldn't force my way to the end. The reasons are simple. The protagonist spends dozens upon dozens of pages complaining. And complaining. And complaining. He's an awful two domensional character, that was written as the embodiement of a selfish and never to be fulfilled teen ager, and it takes all the fun out of the story, which otherwise would make a great backdrop to the story, if the whiney and negative walking stereotype didn't steal the show for his endless rants.If you enjoyed this book, then great. But I could never say that I did, or that I could expect others to. "
1040,Sabra Snider,"Why do people like this book? The themes of alienation and lack of direction are relatable, sure. But the main character is SO annoying that you stop feeling sorry for him fifty pages in, and there's really no resolution. I find it shamefully ironic to complain about a book because of all the whining that happens in it.... Yet, here we are. I did not enjoy reading this, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
1041,Mitchell Sutton,"Despite the hype the surrounded this book, this almost qualifies as the worst book that I have ever read. I completely fail to see how this book is so famous and revered. It had a ridiculously boring plot that made it a chore to read. I found that it had no entertainment value whatso ever, and so the only reason I continued to read it was that I must study it in English class. The main character, Holden Caufield, is completely and utterly insufferable. He is the narrator, contributing to my extensive dislike of the book. The way that he talks is unintelligable and quite frankly annoying. He often repeats himself, and seems to think almost everyone is a ""phony"". I think he is the biggest phony in the whole book. Some might say that the entertainment comes from the message behind the book. They might say something along the lines of ""It shows how difficult a time adolences is"". I find this complete nonsense. I reject the fact that it shows this, and believe that it simply shows how dysfunctional an idiotic the main character is. In my opinion, don't bother reading it if you do not have to."
1042,Potato,"i didn't like this book because it talked of a person wandering around the streets of New York and having the attention span of a child. They detailed every single thought that ever made a journey across their mind and it either depressed the hell out of them, or he thought it was cheesy. This person really needs a counselor I don't understand why people enjoy reading about a teenager who think everything in the world is either black or white, who doesn't feel like doing anything and always depressed."
1043,Katie Brown,"I'm unable to see, quite frankly, the reason for the devotion some people have to this book. Nothing happens. The story does not move forward, and is dull. "
1044,Fardila Metavia,"It is basically a shit book about this hypocrite little bastard named Holden Caulfield that bitch mostly about everything in the whole world and looks like he was going into some phase of ""i-don't-give-a-shit-of-what-other-people-think-of-me-they-fucking-hate-me-anyway"" teenager kind of thing and got kicked out of his school because he was just the real douchebag you've ever met. And it has these lamest jokes I've ever read for my entire life. So you can imagine my disappointment when I hated it. Not only did I hate Holden, but I hated everything about the novel. There was nothing I enjoyed, except maybe that Old Phoebe, his little sister, I felt like pinching her in the cheek because she was just smart and pure intelligent and bloody innocent, one hundred and eighty degrees different from her stupid shitty brother.Oh and the most coherent quotes I've ever got in this book is when Holden was bitching around. eg: People never notice everything. People always ruining things for you. People never believe you and some shit like that.So, no. This is highly unlikeable for me."
1045,Cami,So I loved this book when I was 16. Loved it. Thought Holden was the coolest. At 34? Holden is all the adjectives he uses for almost everyone else...
1046,Alexandra aka Auntie J,"Tried to read this when I was a teenager, but didn't like it and didn't finish. "
1047,Briana Garrett,"I can't be the only person who thought this book was overrated, right? And can i just say that Holden is incredibly annoying and whiny? Because that's how i feel, and i am 16- just bursting with teen angst. The only thing that made this book remotely entertaining was the fact that Holden cursed every other word or so, because this story had literally no plot other than a spoiled rich kid flunks out of school and walks around town hating the world. Lame. I put this into my classics folder loosely."
1048,Evan Bressler,Holden seemed to be the source of his own problems. I felt like I walked away from this book knowing nothing more other than pessimists are pessimists.
1049,Tali,"A complete waste of time. Can't understand why is this considered a classic, even for American Literature, what is so classic about it? It has no plot, Holden is an insufferable, pissy teenager that pretty much loathes everyone and thinks that he is so much better than anyone else who is either phony or a moron. And what about the freaking obsession with the ducks in the ""lagoon""...The writing style is horrible. Salinger loves to repeat himself and you can find the same sentence even three times in a single paragraph, all-across-the-book. All the swearing, all the times that Holden states that something ""killed him"", UUUGH. Maybe you do need to be an angsty teen to appreciate it, but this is something that I will never read again. It was only 220 pages, thank all the gods for that. "
1050,Janna Huyler collins,"I really, really, really disliked this book. I can't recommend it to anyone for any reason. The entire time I was reading it, it caused me to be utterly depressed."
1051,Maj,"I didn't liked it. So disappointed. I saw this on a site and it seems a pretty big deal if you have and read one so I thought it's an excellent, timeless book. Only to find out that I was wrong. This book is a diary of a sixteen-year old Holden who loves to swear! ""phony, ""goddamn"", blah blah blah. That killed me!. Where's the climax? Maybe at the end because it's the end. Or maybe I just missed it. I thought Holden was going to find Jane or die. That'll make a good story. He's going nowhere.Maybe I just expected too much from it. *hands up* my opinion."
1052,Melody May,"Whiney and overrated. Seriously, if I wanted to hear this kind of crap, I would listen to emo music. Suck it up, Holden."
1053,Esté,Ek het die boek glad nie geniet nie. Weereens 'n boek wat in die eerste persoon geskryf is - wat het nou eintlik gebeur in die storie? 
1054,Michael Munkvold,"I. Hate. This. Book. The Catcher in the Rye is so bad, it makes me angry. I loathe the sight of the damn thing. Not just because I was forced to read it in 9th grade. Not just because it inspires pseudo-intellectual coffee shop babble. Not just because it inspired Mark Chapman to kill John Lennon. No, I hate this book, first and foremost and without further ado, because it's a horrible piece of writing. It just plain sucks. Yes, I know it's a ""classic"" and a cultural touchstone - but, for the life of me, I can't understand why. The prose is stilted and painfully affected (find me anyone who talks like the characters in this book, and I'll buy you a beer). The story, such as it is, is dull and pretentious. And Holden Caulfield may be the most despicable character an author ever wasted their readers' time with.He's awful, a spoiled, narcissistic brat who spends 277 loooong pages whining about the burden of being born into wealth and privilege, and how everyone and everything - except, of course, himself - is ""phony"". Even his much-celebrated love for his sister Phoebe is self-serving, an excuse to indulge in a fantasy about saving children from mass suicide... or something, by that part of the book I wasn't paying attention anymore.I have no problem with unsympathetic characters, mind you. Some of my favorite fictional characters - Tom Ripley, Cathy Ames, Pinkie Brown - are as nasty as they come. The difference is that those characters are three-dimensional human beings, who change and grow throughout the story, if not always for the better. Plus, they're actually interesting. Holden Caulfield, on the other hand, is guilty of the worst possible flaw a character can have: He's boring. He's just a spoiled brat whose only personality trait is that he's a spoiled brat. He doesn't change or grow at all; he's a nasty little creep at the beginning of the story, and a nasty little creep he remains throughout. He's not worth caring about, loving to hate, or even watching with morbid fascination. That's the point, you say? Social commentary, says you? Catcher in the Rye doesn't deserve the label. Portnoy's Complaint and American Psycho are social commentary because they actually have something to say, and don't take themselves so seriously that they're above being funny. Catcher in the Rye, on the other hand, is the worst kind of verbal masturbation: the kind that thinks it's changing the world. Much like its ""hero"", Catcher in the Rye has no sense of humor about itself and believes it has all the answers, and if you don't like it, well... as Caulfield himself might say, you're just a big old goddamn phony, you really are.Did I mention that I hate this book?"
1055,Eby,"I couldn't stand this book when we read it in high school. The character of Holden drove me crazy - I thought he was irritating, self-defeating, immature. It annoyed me that we as 16-YOs were expected to identify with him. "
1056,Nel,Dull read which barely had a storyline. Everyone is a 'phoney' according to Holden - I got so sick of reading that word i almost gave up reading the entire book...disappointing
1057,Polloloco69,"My take on the novel The Catcher In the Rye is that it is a simple text, but has bigger meaning to it. However, the meaning/idea behind it is not too hard to understand. For some, it may be too complex to comprehend, but everyone has a little trouble with certain texts. Students should be aloud to read this book because it's not graphic, the only ""bad thing"" it mentions is prostitution, but even that part in the book is not absurd. People need to realize that the things that are mentioned in this book are real life and sooner or later they're going to have to hear about them or experience them themselves. Life isn't going to sugar coat things for you so why should a book have to? "
1058,Susan Storz,"Gave me a absolute headache. Maybe I would have appreciated this book more as a teen, but as a mom of teens, I just wanted to smack him. Sorry to offend anyone who enjoyed it."
1059,Marc,"I really disliked this book. Normally, and especially with classics I'll read them and even if I don't like them I can at least appreciate what the book is. At the very least I'll hate it but I can understand why other people enjoy it. Not the case with this book. I don't get it and I don't get why other people get it. I wanted to like this book because so many other people do. Honestly I have to wonder if half the people who say they love this book have even ever read it. The book is boring. Worse than boring really because the entire book is filled with potential for something to happen but every time something ALMOST happens Holden either chickens out or ends up hating everyone involved and bailing. Perhaps I was too old when I read this book to be able to relate to Holden. Certainly when I was a teenager I had similar feelings and ideas but I just can't relate at all. As a hiker there is a concept called peak bagging. Where even if the hike isn't all that grand or the view isn't all that wonderous you still climb to the top of the peak just to say that you did it and add it to your bag. I'm glad that I bagged this peak but boy I'll tell you it was quite a short and crumby hike. I don't have any desire to ever do it again to tell you the truth."
1060,Jill Crosby,"Forty years after I first read this dog, and I STILL hate it. Blahblahblah goddam blahblahblah red hat blahblahblah and all blahblahblah phonies blahblahblah. "
1061,Gerald,"Boring.I read this book, or I started to read this book, I had high hopes, since all my friends raved about it when they read it. I gave up at the halfway mark, it's boring.Holden Caulfield comes across as whiny, and totally uninteresting, I found him to be totally unlikeable. I could have overlooked this, but his narrative is as flat as his character. At the halfway mark, feeling NOTHING to keep me reading this, I gave up. "
1062,Karlie Logan,"I had to read this book my sophomore year in high school. I couldn't stand reading it. I barely got through it. To be honest, I wanted to throw it against a wall! The character is pathetic and isn't good with his vocabulary. I mean, if you're going to cuss at least do it right, instead of just doing it when unnecessary. "
1063,Oleg Zviagin,Fuck you Holden Caufield. 
1064,Mark,"If I had read this as a teenager I might have given it a different rating, but I was an adult and really hated Holden. He was one of those entitled brats that needs to be put in his place more often. I can understand why so many teens fall for his crap, but anyone that truly follows him, will grow up to be real pains to society as a whole."
1065,Book Burner,"If 485,104 people (as of 9/13/2014) like this book, than I must personally slap them in the face.The Catcher in the Rye is just a terrible book. I had to read this for school, and my teacher told us of how ""it's not as bad as people say"". She is right. It's WORSE.Summary: Our story begins with a degenerate that leaves school after getting into a fight with his room mate over how a girl plays checkers. So he walks around the streets, getting drunk and criticizing everything that moves. He apparently has something to say for everyone. Well, almost everyone: enter his little sister. His apparently perfect little sister that is oh so perfect and perfectly roller-blade skinny. Oh, how perfect.This book has no meaning. I take that back: this book DOES have a meaning: it shows us just how bad books can get. If Hitler won WWII, than this book would have never existed. That's right! This book makes me wish that he DID win the war, just to prevent this abomination from happening."
1066,Geoffrey,"Does it count if I gave up halfway through?I didn't like it, nonetheless. I think I like my depressed postwar authors more Vonnegut than Salinger."
1067,Raj Dhakal,"My first book is horrible. This book is all about a high school student named Holden Caulfield. He gets kicked out of school because of his horrible grades, but he hangs around New York instead of going home. All he does crazy things in New York. Thats it ...the end of the book. I am STILL wondering why some people gave 5 STAR. I read till the end of this book for something - anything! - to happen. But nothing happened. This is a good book to punish yourself."
1068,Ellen,"What a downer! I thought I had read this in college, but I guess not. I was inspired to try it again after watching the interesting new PBS biography of J.D. Salinger. Catcher in the Rye is generally regarded as a classic in American literature, I guess, because it is one of the first 20th century coming of age-type stories, written in the vernacular language of New York in the 1940s. However, Holden Caulfield seems like a manic depressive to me, more in need of medication than anything else."
1069,Aditee Parmar,"okay. so after reading these amazing reviews, i bought this book and read it...i had tons of expectations but trust me, nothing about this book is ""life changing"". it hardly passes as 'entertaining'. God I hated reading it...the worst part is, while reading it, i was thinking 'okay maybe it has a fabulous ending' or something and guess what, it didn't. have a fab ending, i mean. the book ended where it started (except for the geographical position) (actually, that was the only thing that changed); Holden was the same boy he was at the beginning of the novel and i didn't like him one bit. being a teenager myself, i couldn't relate to him that well. I'm still confused as to what exactly was the point of the entire book and WHAT makes people say it changed their lives...cuz it didn't affect me one bit. *quite disappointed*"
1070,Mary,"Holden struck me as a whiny little so and so. I've never understood why we're supposed to find profound meaning from such a self-absorbed, juvenile character."
1071,Christina Maria,"Since there was no plot and the writing was readable but prosaic, I think this was a character based book. The problem is the character, Holden Caulfield, is self-centered, narrow, asshole. It's one thing to be a rebel without a cause who spouts out flimsy ""social commentary"", but the social commentary there was to make was ignored, probably because it did not affect Holden Caulfield. In fact, the society he was claiming to criticize pretty much catered to him.I know that this book was groundbreaking at the time, and I used to think I might have preferred to read it at that time. Then I remembered I would be able to relate to his privileged idleness even less in the '50s. Oh well."
1072,Meg,"Dear brain,I'm sorry. So sorry. Please don't make me sleep on the couch. I still love you.Kisses,Meg"
1073,Mel,"I can never understand why such boring books make classics and people actually enjoy reading them. What did this book have to offer other than a potential insight into a boy/man's life of that particular era? How does this make it any different than many books of its generation? This book bored me. There, I said it. A pointlessly boring book."
1074,Dave Williams,Not sure what all the fuss was about with this one. Maybe I missed something. Found the depression and sexual molestation and phonie aspects interesting. Wasnt sure where it was all going. 
1075,Zanna,"I just had a shuffle through this book to remind myself what it was all about and it's pretty horrendous, sort of barely excusable on the basis that this person could exist and think these things. What's really depressing about it is that he's taken to be a hero rather than a frightening symptom...There is one image in this book that I like - the oil puddle - the idea that every experience is transformative.But it gets minus two for misogyny and minus one for general ignorance and minus one more for annoying style, so one star."
1076,Xinyi Tan,"this book was so meh! it's so short, yet took me forever to read, because i kept falling asleep. it was just boring and very hard to read. i hated the way he talked. i'm not sure if that's how teens talked back then, but it was just annoying. perhaps i just don't relate or understand his character at all... everything just made no sense to me. i'm just glad to be done with it and to move onto better books. it's definitely not for everyone."
1077,Charina,too teen angsty for me. Kind of one long rant. Maybe if I read this in highschool...? As far as classics go not sure why it is. 
1078,Stacia,I did not enjoy this book at all. Unfortunately I am the type that has to finish a book that I start. I just kept waiting for it to get better. I didn't enjoy reading the ramblings of a teen that is all talk and never follows through on any of the ridiculous things he goes on and on about. 
1079,Fiona Dunger,Forced to read it for school and I love reading. Every second of this was torture. I dont see how everyone can love it so much?!
1080,Marilyn,"He's young, rich, spoiled rotten and curses a lot. Difficult to empathize with his situation. Perhaps this is one of those books that guys get. I don't. The main character is a jerk."
1081,Jona Cannon,"A rambling accounting of about 3 to 4 days in the life of a teenager named Holden Caulfield. Holden is mentally unstable, and a bit distraught over being expelled from another expensive boarding school. There is absolutley no plot. It is exactly like reading the mind of a teenager with no personal motivation, or ambition. Mildly amusing, mildly depressing, rampant profanity.This is the worst book I've read in a long time. Yes, that includes the House of Night series, and the Cirque Du Freak! I was very disappointed. I would recommend this to anybody who likes to slow down at the scene of a vehicle accident for the sake of curiosity. It offers no literary value or edification whatsoever. When I started reading it, I kept expecting it to get better, or make some kind of point. When I realized it wasn't going to improve, I felt far enough invested in it, that I decided to finish it reguardless of my low opinion."
1082,Jennilyn,I don't know what to think...
1083,Stephanne Stacey,"Not only did I read the book, but I read a number of reviews and forums. I wanted to understand why this books is so sensational. Why it ranks in a number of 100 best books list. I still don't understand. Perhaps it's because I had never thought like Holden even as a rebellious teenager. Perhaps it's because I'm reading it as an adult with teenage children who don't think this way either. Perhaps in the many ""deep"" discussions I had with my then teenage friends I never got the impression that they thought this way either. Nor did I see that they acted as such. I view this books to be nothing but a means to shock the public. It's so vulgar, careless, poorly thought out, I could go on. I nearly put it done several times due to the utter pointless, and offending language. This book churns my stomach. Literature is meant to educate, entertain, and enrich. Yes, sometimes that means being offensive, but not vulgar. I do not think literature was meant to exact a sensational reaction for the sake of getting the reaction. What was the point of this novel? What was Salinger trying to educate us to? Was it something that warranted this kind of writing, or could it have been done in another more influential and less shocking style?I will never promote this book. My children will never read it while they are under my roof. And I will throw away any copy I may come upon."
1084,Teri,Why on Earth do so many people love this book?! Goodness gracious it was almost painful to read. I guess I would have enjoyed it much more if I were a teenager more precisely a teenage boy. The ramblings of Holden just didn't do a thing for me...other than annoy the crap out of me that is. It was just all over the place sometimes it was even hard to keep up. I guess I'm glad I read it since it's a classic and all but maybe I should have read it a long long time ago! 
1085,Debby,"1 starWhy is this a classic? Why is this one of the ""great"" American novels? Jesus, did this book make me want to throw my e-reader across the room. I don't get it.So, a little bit of context: I read this for one of my book club's classics months. I had heard from multiple people that it's horrible, and that I would not enjoy it, but I was curious anyway. That mainly came from two reasons: (1) it's such a highly regarded classic, and I felt kind of bad not having read it, and (2) it's noted as having inspired (or at least a large influence on) The Perks of Being a Wallflower, which is undoubtedly one of my favorite books of all time. To point 1, I say, literary people, I don't get you; and to point 2, I say, teachers, start teaching Perks instead.This book is stupid. Actually, in going to describe it, I'm struck with the urge to use old Holden's annoying narrative style and all. If you haven't read the book, you may not understand, so I'll try to resist. You see, Holden Caulfield is one of the most annoying, idiotic, hypocritical douchebags I've ever encountered. And yeah, I'm sure that was the point. The Catcher in the Rye follows his story about how he got kicked out of his boarding school for failing everything (generally he didn't bother to try at all). Basically, he goes around New York and just has one gigantic rant about how everyone he sees, EVERYONE, is a moron and a phony - before and after and sometimes during asking these people for favors and hanging out with them. He's so hypocritical that it's just about the most painful thing ever to read.To make it worse, his narrative style is extremely juvenile, repetitive and grating. He's constantly using the same phrases: ""and all"", ""or anything"", sort of"", ""I swear"", ""for Chrissakes"", ""moron"", """"phony"", ""old [character name]"", ""it just about killed me"", ""it drives me crazy"", etc. I'm thinking about how people went through Fifty Shades of Grey and counted the frequencies of phrases like ""her inner goddess"" or whatever being used - and the same could and should be done for The Catcher in the Rye. It's - so - annoying. Granted, he is 16, so part of this could be considered his personality, and it was written in the fifties - so what the hell do I know about how they spoke back then. But if it was like this, god am I happy to be living in the now.Aside from his annoying ranting, Holden's actions speak even louder to the fact that something's not right with this guy. He calls people morons and then invites them to go out for drinks or to the movies. He meets a stranger and they talk for two seconds, so he asks him to go get a drink. He smokes about 3 packs of cigarettes in one day. He's arrogant about his own intelligence when it appears he has none. He's outraged when people don't serve him alcohol in bars, despite being 16. And it seems like he has ADD: not just in his ranting can he easily get distracted and go off on a tangent, but he'll be doing one thing and then decide, ""Hey! I should call up this girl right now, in the middle of the night, because she just popped into my head."" It's confusing and messy, but I suppose it did kind of keep me reading, because the hint of something being wrong with him created a mystery that I wanted solved.But the ending is probably the most aggravating part of all. (view spoiler)[All throughout the book, you can tell there's something not right with Holden. He talks about getting depressed, he even gets sicker and sicker in the last few pages, literally going to throw up and breaking out in sweats out of the blue. He references his dead brother, a classmate who committed suicide, his old teacher appears to try to molest him. And then. The freaking. Book. Ends. He seriously just cuts it out with a, ""Well, that's all I'm going to tell you,"" and indicates that he's in the hospital for SOMETHING. Jesus, fuck, seriously?? I don't get ittttt. I'd very much like to know what's wrong with him, in hopes that maybe I could bring myself to care JUST A LITTLE about him. Maybe I could empathize. JUST A LITTLE. Buuut no. (hide spoiler)]That aside, worse is the fact that even at the end, Holden didn't learn anything at all. He ends the book complaining yet again about how people were asking him if he would apply himself next year, and explaining that he didn't know because that's only something you know when you do it. That. NO. JUST. UGH. That's a decision you are able to make in advance! No wonder you flunk - even now you won't try. You know what? Fuck you, Holden. I don't give two shits what happens to you. The way it is, this book just boils down to rich white people problems. Apparently I am unable to read any more into this. Where's a good English teacher when you need one? Seriously though, things shouldn't be THIS open ended. The set up isn't done well enough to help me figure it out, and I don't feel like I can trust Holden's voice even for a second. Again: choose Perks instead.
Summing Up:
In the words of Holden Caulfield: This book just about KILLED me. That old Holden Caulfield is such a goddamn moron. He doesn't even realize he's sort of the world's most judgmental prick and all. Nothing happened but this goddamn rant about how everyone in the freaking world is so moronic, and the idiot didn't even learn anything for Chrissakes. It just about drives me crazy! He's the biggest phony of them all, and if I ever hear that word again it's too soon. I swear, how anyone is able to like and praise this book or anything is beyond me.(I realize you are free to like whatever books you like, and if this is a favorite of yours - that's fine! I just don't get it. If you want to try to respectfully explain it to me in the comments, feel free.)
GIF it to me straight!

Recommended To:
Don't! Read The Perks of Being a Wallflower instead. And flip off anyone who gets judgmental about that.

1086,Surbhi Goel,"What is Teenage? To me, it is the age of experimenting rather than taking advice, questioning every notion and rebellion becomes a natural necessity. As an adult today, if we look back at out lives as teenagers we must have done all this. So, how is Holden Caulfield different than any other teenager? Except the fact, that he is a bit more twisted than an average teenager.The book begins with Holden directly addressing the reader, and recounts the events over a three-day period from last December following his expulsion from Pencey Prep, a private school. Almost the entire story is one long flashback of this three-day period with occasional references to the present. After a fight with his roommate, Stradlater, Holden runs away from school to explore New York before returning home, interacts with teachers, prostitutes, nuns, an old girlfriend, and his sister along the way.The overall plot/story focuses on Holden, a spoiled brat, egocentric, teenager riddled with angst during this coming of age time. However through out the book. Holden calls everyone a phony or a bastard, there were more complaining than actual story.The narration consisted of annoying repetitions of a select vocabulary such as; bastard, phony, damn, at the end of almost every single sentence. He also fails to explain certain things because he's ""not in the mood.""Holden is a rich kid who keeps on getting chance after chance and just keeps blowing it because he is so self-absorbed and self-pitying. He has been kicked out of 3 schools, he’s lousy with girls, drinks and smokes, and lacks a good sense of social skills. . He understands personalities and knows exactly what to expect of certain people, yet he is often surprised by what certain people do. How this character is supposed to relate to the youth that struggle with becoming an adult.The only character I enjoyed was Phoebe. In the end I believe it was Phoebe that was Holden's only ""friend"" and a sensible voice in the book.What I really wondered was why Holden was so set on running away and never going home. As a rebellious teenager at least explain, what your parents did or said to you that was so horrible. Even if it wasn't his parents, there was no explain of why, it was simply stated that he never wanted to go home.After finishing the book, the one question that lingered in my mind was – Why is this book a classic?"
1087,Ranjitha,"What a let down! After repeated recommendations I greatly looked forward to reading it. Unfortunately, the book disappointed me. Lack of plot or even a point in the whole book left my nerves wrecked. It is the plot about a boy who is rusticated from school and how he spends the following days. Each of the page contained either of the words-phoney, fuck or bastard. After a point, as a reader I lost interest. If you are someone who likes to read books that are hugely hyped, then go for it. Others, kindly ignore it."
1088,Renee Wolfe,Definitely a young person's novel...
1089,Heba Aldebany,لو أن الكاتب كان يريد إيصال فكرة الصراع أو الضياع بين الكاتب والجانب المظلم من الإنسانية ... عفوا بس ماوصلتش ! لو برضو أراد الكاتب وصف رحله بحث عن الذات.. برضو ماوصلتش ! ماذا أراد الكاتب أن يقول في هذه الرواية !؟ ماوصلنيش!!
1090,Sam Funderburk,"I can appreciate the reasons that this book may have been shocking to read in it's time, but it is simply a grotesquely over done example of the mind of a teenager with bi-polar disorder. Holden Caulfield should have gotten punched in the face quite a few more times and then actually banged the hooker and this would have been fitting of it's title as a literary masterpiece. "
1091,Corina,"Wow...this was extremely boring for my taste in books.Main character is completely out of area of interest with all the cursing, stupid things and stupid mentality that he has.Did not like it!"
1092,Rayne Roberts,"I waited 30 years to read this book and frankly, I wish that I'd waited another 30 years. Oh, the disappointment. It reads like a 1940s B movie and that's the best I can say about it."
1093,Aleesa,"So what was the point of this book? That young men are narcissistic, self-centered, thoroughly entitled shits? Yes? I already knew that. "
1094,Julie - Book Hooked Blog,I couldn't really get past all the angst. Holden Cauffield was just such a whiner. I didn't identify with any of the characters and couldn't really get into the book at all.
1095,Autumn,"Basically, this book was about a young man withno direction who hated most everything and kept getting kicked out of prep schools. His dialogue was very repetitive and every other word was a curse word, which was supposed to give him character I suppose but made it extremely annoying to read. "
1096,Sarah Gibson,I'm 18 and I picked this up because it was considered a classic and I never read it in high school. It's fair to say I was disappointed. I'm not sure why it's even considered a classic at all. Holden only ever calls anyone he meets a phoney and the only good thing about him is the fact that he loves his little sister but other than that I found it pretty boring. I'm mostly likely not going to be reading this book again. 
1097,Julianna,"My statis is lying, I couldn't finish this book, something about just really ticked me off and today, at about page 110, snapped and threw the book down because I couldn't stand reading this book anymore. I think it was combination of the storyline, the writing style, the character's attitude and the annoying voice I heard as I read this book is what made me lose it. The entire time, I couldn't figure out why this book is considered a classic and I don't think I'm going to figure it out soon. I did find sime bits interesting, but those parts were only little details that Holden brought up about his family and didn't really alaborate on. Yeah, I didn't hide this review because of spoilers I hid because I'm hoping people who liked this book won't read it."
1098,Julianne,"I have been trying to intersperse my fun readings with some of the classics I missed in school. Perhaps I have outgrown the message of this book, but I did not find it to be a worthwhile let alone universal treatment of being a teenage boy with emotional problems. The kid is messed up, uses my least favorite swear word of all time (g.damn) in every other sentence, has serious ADD or even Bi-Polar and the realizations he comes to during the few days we follow him are hollow. I do not understand why this is considered essential reading. "
1099,Cindy,"This classic was banned by many schools and I can see why. Holden Caulfield's voice is brilliant writing, but I didn't really care about this book. I could have lived without it."
1100,Nick Devlin,"I FINISHED. I want a medal. Well judging by my reaction I'm gonna say I didnt enjoy this book much. It was a trial. But It did improve as the story went on. I think my main problem with this story is my trouble identifying with Holden. Without being able to sympathize with him, this story is unbearable. What's funny is that the more I got annoyed with the book the more I sympathized with him because I was starting to be in the kind of mood that he was throughout.Ah well, hopefully future 'classics' that I read will be more to my liking."
1101,Andy Kuhn,Maybe you have to have been an angst ridden youth to appreciate this book. I read and read waiting for something to happen wanting to love this book. The writing isn't spectacular and the character Holden Canfield is a piss any and doesn't make me even want to care about his plight. Ambivalent is all I feel after reading this book. 
1102,Cathy,"Maybe I was too old to read it for the first time, but I really didn't like this book. I couldn't stand Holden and thought he was a pathetic, whiny, pain in the ass. "
1103,Meaghan,"Truth be told, I hated it. Really hated it. Honestly, I would not flinch if someone were to set my copy on fire.I was recommended this book by pretty much everyone in my English literature class... I know not why. I lost a tiny bit of respect for my English Lit teacher for recommending it to me, to be honest. The main character, despite the insistence of just about everybody in the real world, is so unlikeable. He's repetitive, he's weird, selfish, childish, annoying, kinda pathetic... the list goes on. If I hear ""it really is,"" ""you really are"" or anything similar for the next week or so, I think I'll just weep. Despite his situation there's nothing badass or even endearing about Holden; in fact, I think I preferred his younger sister. Nope, I definitely prefer his little sister. She was more badass than him.If you're thinking about picking up this book (and I implore you not to) bare in mind that you'll either love it or hate it. I know so many people who adore it, so don't take this review to heart if you're passionate about trying it out... but otherwise... stay away."
1104,Dave Lee,"I hated this book, and it wasn't because of the language. Nearly everything about this book was annoying. Characters, settings, etc. Whoever says everyone should read this book was flat out wrong. Some people love it yet I still haven't heard a compelling reason from them why I should."
1105,Hunter Jenkins, If I was stuck on deserted island and all I had was the book catcher in the rye I still wouldn't read it. The book had a very negative vibe and I felt that Holden's life was getting worse throughout the whole book. This book is like the book Perks of being a wallflower. I would recommend this book to anyone who doesn't want to grow up eventually.
1106,Maggie Conlon-Martin,"After watching the documentary ""Salinger"" and learning he left a huge body of work to be published posthumously (including more books about Holden Caulfield), decided I better read this book. What a struggle it was! Could be read in one day, yet it took me over a week of forced reading to get through it, it was SO boring. Mystifies me why this book is considered a classic and one of the best books of the 20th century. I couldn't find a plot. Holden was a whinny, privileged teenager, and I found it impossible to feel any empathy for him. It left me feeling angry that I wasted so much time reading this book."
1107,Diana Hernandez,"I was honestly very disappointed. I heard so many great things about the book and I tried really hard to keep reading and like it, but unfortunately I disliked it. I rarely dislike books but I could just not get into it."
1108,Jamie,"This is the one and only book that I did not finish reading! Every other book I started I did finish!! That says it all, I'm just saying!"
1109,Melanie,I really didn't understand why this book gets so much hype. I thought it was depressing and I was disappointed that I sought it out to read since it was a 'classic.'
1110,Peyton Sloane,Evidently I am completely ignorant; I just don't get it. This is classic literature?
1111,Prerna Negi,"I tried to push myself to complete this book but was a waste of time and flow. The book has got good ratings, but I fail to see why? "
1112,Rhardwick,"I'll admit, this book had me curious for a long while. I've had a copy of it lying around in my house for about two years now, but it wasn't until I chose it as part of an assignment in class did I pick it up and start reading it. All the praise I heard about it being a ""classic"" and ""necessary reading"" actually got me somewhat in the mood to plow through the thing and enjoy it in the meantime.Besides ""Carry On, Mr. Bowditch,"" this is currently the top contender for the most horrid books on the planet. For those of you unfamiliar with the story, it can really be summed up in a short statement: it's about angsty teenager extraordinaire Holden Caulfield and his dissatisfaction with the world he lives in. Trying to describe the plot more than that is more an exercise in futility than anything. Almost nothing of any note occurs in the novel. Holden gets expelled from his school for poor grades and spends the rest of the novel stewing in his own juices and moping about the gigantic sham he perceives society to be and displaying an unhealthy interest in children and their qualities. The book treads water and finally sinks at the end when it's clear that Holden has not changed at all from the man he was at the beginning of the novel. In general, I appreciate a stream of consciousness narrative when it's used in a story, especially like the one used in William S. Burrough's Naked Lunch. The problem with the one used in The Catcher In The Rye is that unless you happen to be a younger teen and thinks the world will never understand you or is undeserving of you, this prose will start to grate on your nerves. Every other sentence seems to have the words ""I felt sorry as hell..."" or ""no kidding"" jammed into them. While the latter was used a lot back in the '40s, the number times he uses it in the book makes it feel like he’s cheapening the effect. Another point that bothered me was Holden's attitude towards along with himself. To him, the people that surround him are ""phonies,"" fakes that pretend to get by in life or to adapt socially. The problem with this is the fact that Holden is guilty of overzealous hypocrisy. While he tries to pass judgment on others and justify his reasons for doing so, he refuses to look at himself objectively and try to curb his rampant flaws. The individual always holds his or her self highest in their mind, at least subconsciously, seeing as it's an instinctual holdover, but Holden's self-absorbedness borders on pompous and annoyingly egocentric. Besides nit-picking every flaw society has to offer, he focuses on cultivating his Monsieur Tough-guy image, which is simply painful to read since though he criticizes adults, he attempts to emulate them with the mind of a child. The excuses he makes up for avoiding certain things are not very justifiable either- simple or not, he tries to worm out of every situation he doesn't feel like taking part in. His encounter with the prostitute in the first half in the book is a perfect example of this. He decides he wants to have sex with the woman, but gets cold feet when she directly propositions him and states to the reader that ""you really have to be in the mood for that stuff."" He even uses this excuse to simply avoid asking for someone on the phone. Other authors can make readers sympathetic with the plight of protagonists who have problems like erotophobia, but Salinger failed to make Holden into a likable character and instead made me detest the character.To be fair, the description of the city was nice and so was the banter between New York natives in the story. When Holden wasn't whining about one or the other and pussyfooting around people, those sections that focus on the city are actually enjoyable.That by itself does not save it though. This book is awful. It goes nowhere fast and runs only on the steam of Holden’s whining- it took a monumental amount of will power to get even halfway through the book and nearly bored me to death to get to the end. I can see the appeal in the novel, but I question why it has achieved classic status. Holden’s last words in the book, “Don’t ever tell anybody anything. If you do, you start missing everybody,“ allow for a retort; he has told everyone who has read the book everything about himself, but some readers will definitely be glad to be finished with him."
1113,Sabrina,"Warning: If you liked the book, then please just ignore this review as I am not looking to offend anyone. If you haven’t read it yet, this review also contains some spoilers.The Catcher in the Rye by JD Salinger is a novel centered around a hypocritical 16-year-old named Holden Caulfield. Narrated in the first person point of view, it shows insight into an annoying and troubled teen's mind after having been expelled from the most recent of a long line of schools. Holden's pessimistic view is present throughout the entire book and his character is an absolute hypocrite that I find infuriatingly annoying. Despite the poor choice of a subject, the book was well-written to convey Salinger's purpose.Salinger accomplished the impressive feat of using diction to convey the first-person views and thoughts of a teenage boy. He commonly uses curse words and a stream of consciousness that is nearly impossible for the reader to follow in some parts. This adds to the overall impression of the voice of Holden Caulfield being reasonably realistic for his intended character.	Though the plot of the book was only a few days long, there were many moments that seemed to be defining parts of Holden’s life. Throughout the novel, Holden is questioning the need to function the way society tells him to. Holden is saved from abandoning society altogether at the last second by receiving the love he truly needs from his younger sister, Phoebe. Some people find ideas like these relatable and love the book for it, but I do not feel any such connection that some people apparently do.	I also could not get over the fact that there are many parts in the book that leave the reader questioning Holden’s mental health also. The fact that he broke all the windows in the garage after Allie’s death and still talks to Allie even though Allie is dead, his telling Ackley that his hat was a not a deer shooting hat, for it was a “people shooting hat,” his talking multiple times like he was already dead and imagining his own funeral, and his extreme attention to detail suggest that he has mental health issues. Then add to that the whole book was Holden telling his story to a psychoanalyst, and I come to the conclusion that Holden is a psychopath.	Overall, the book was well-written but had a poor choice of a subject that left me with a negative impression of it. I would not recommend this book to anyone.P.S. I do note the irony here. I’m a teenager writing a complaint about a book that I didn’t like because it was written about an annoying teenager who complains a lot. "
1114,Chris Stanley,Burn me at the stake if you must but I thought this book was highly overated predictable and the narrative wholly irritating. I guess I'm just getting old because my own 16 old daughter found it fabulous! 
1115,Cym Lauing,"It was interesting.. I can't believe I've never read this book before, and I don't know what I was expecting while reading it. Maybe a different version on ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" or something. Anyway, it was a great read, and I'd recommend it completely to teenagers, even if they don't really get the language used."
1116,"""that Guy""","I dont know how anyone likes this book. I could write a better one than this! If the word ""phoney"" and half the curse words were taken out of the book, the book would realistically shrink by about 1/6 of the total current pages. The phrases are overused, the main character is spoiled, used to having his way, and decides to do whatever he feels. he has no common sense, and this is a ""beginning to have common sense"" story rather than a growing up story. While it is supposed to be the champion of rebellious books, it is really a literary disaster on magnificent proportions. "
1117,Henna,I feel like a horrible person when I say that this book was so dull. I know it's a classic and how it's great and stuff but it didn't work on me. Maybe I was too young to understand it's meaning (I read it when I was 14) but yeah.
1118,N.,"Ще бъда честна. Разочарована съм. Може би защото тази книга е класика. Може би защото съм попадала на толкова много отлични отзиви. По дяволите, може би защото някога четенето й се е считало табу, а днес масово се изучава в някои държави.Разочарована съм. И не само това, чувствам се използвана. Изключително странно и ново чувство, не ми се беше случвало досега. Честно, изпуснах ли нещо?!Прочетох я за общо около 6 часа, като, повярвайте ми, не изгубих надежда нито веднъж. Интерес - възможно, но до последно вярвах, че нещо ще ме грабне. Че същинският сюжет ще се разгърне на следващата страница, просто трябва да съм търпелива. Да, но не. Не се. Книгата започна някъде в средата на нещо и завърши без същински край. Колкото и да бяха влудяващи на моменти повтарянията и безмилостните репетиции на думи и възклицания, разбирам смисъла им - Селинджър просто е желал да създаде правдоподобна мисъл. Нещо наглед необработено, точно както се случва в собствените ни глави. А книгата е именно това - течащата мисъл на един 17-годишен младеж.Който младеж се превърна в най-малко уважавания от мен протагонист. Съжалявам го, ако не друго. Циничен, черноглед и арогантен, Холден е човекът, в когото се надявам никога да не се превърна. Че кой би могъл да заспи с усмивка и веднъж, ако притежаваше същия мисловен процес? Не може всичко около нас да се случва непринудено и спонтанно (защото всичко останало е ""фалшиво"" и ""депресира""). Ако нашият млад Холден Колфилд наистина представлява средностатистическия тийнейджър - някъде съм се объркала, направила съм погрешен завой при навлизане в пубертета и съм се запътила вместо това към долината на аз-не-съм-мързелив-малък-тъпак-който-страда-от-комплекс-за-превъзходство.Исках да го прасна това момче на няколко пъти, честно. Той през цялото време се опитва да намери недостатъците и на най-приятните нему хора, като в последствие решава, че, независимо, ги мрази. Че мрази всичко. Че е толкова недоразбран. Че всички са фалшиви и той е единственият непосредствен, трезвомислещ човек. Препрочитайки ""Спасителя в ръжта"" след години, може би ще намеря повече смисъл. Нещо болезнено красиво и дълбоко, като това колко е трудно да се внедриш в обществото, или това колко рутинен е всъщност животът ни.Но днес? Днес ми показва грешка след грешка. Даже аз, като клоняща към песимизма, се отвратих от отчаяността на героя, страха му, омразата му и, най-вече, нежеланието да погледне себе си.Светът не работи срещу теб, Холден. Ти сам работиш срещу себе си."
1119,Mikebfd,"(To be clear, my Goodreads rating might be one star, but my actual rating is zero stars.)I hated this book. I ""got"" it, but I still hated it. It just wasn't enjoyable -- it was a chore to read. It took me a month to get around to finishing it, and I'm typically a fast reader. It just took a long time for me to read this particular book because I didn't want to read it -- and not because I was being forced to read it (I wasn't; I read it for the first [and, trust me, only] time at the age of thirty-one, of my own free will), but because it was just a dull, rambling, pointless* piece of so-called ""literature"" that was ultimately just a waste of my time. *No, I didn't miss the point. As I said, I ""got"" it -- all of it. I got that Holden was supposed to be an unreliable, hypocritical character. I got that Holden was dealing with unresolved mental issues. I got that the narrative was supposed to be representative of the stereotypical insipid teenager (although I was completely unable to relate to Holden -- I certainly never felt like or acted like he did when I was his age [or any time before or after that point, for that matter], and I'm not exactly unique in that respect). It's not like any of the aforementioned details were subtle, and in any case, they were just details. There's a difference between details and points, and I would argue that this novel had many of the former and none of the latter. But regardless, I got it.I just didn't care. "
1120,Stevie,I hated this book. It was stupid. The character was dull and boring. The story line made no sense. The cussing was excessive and made the story worse. I read it when I was 12 and then 15 and I still never got it. Guess this book just wasn't meant for me.
1121,J,"To explain, I read Stephen Chbosky's ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" first and decided to look for books that were similar in nature. Moving from that to this... I was daunted by the experience. T'was very apathetic and hard to get into. Reading about semi-rich protagonists feeling down on themselves is hard-put for me."
1122,Mizzashley,"Either you love it or you hate it. I just so happen to dislike the whole situation. Caulfield droned on his life seemed spoiled and sad. I forced myself to read up to the part of where he is staying at hotel tries to get a girl from the club to go home with him. And then he calls another very well-known kind of girl that his friend screwed. Another down side for me was how many times the words ""Goddamn"" was used in this book. Too many it gave me a headache. In the end I put this book down looked up its summary and found I really didn't miss out on much. Might have been interesting if Caulfields character died. "
1123,Cheyenne Winterholler,I read this book for honors and I hated it. It had such a negative attitude and I am pretty sure that guy was mentally ill. I had the hardest time reading it and I would never recommend this book for anyone.
1124,Julian Inah Anunciacion y Gamboa,"After finishing the very last page of this book, I never felt more disappointed in my life. As an English major, I originally had astronomical expectations of this modern classic. Almost every credible magazine or website probably inked this book on their well-chosen lists of the best-book-so-and-so. I suddenly had this rare 360-degrees turn then. I always hated it when something like that happens: I expected a knock-out something to blow my mind away and then it would turn out to be contrary to what I expected. Things like that. Hesukristo.The Catcher in the Rye seemed to me like a novel-length Facebook status rant of some self-obsessed schizophrenic with a lot of personal issues to settle. I waited for something to happen that would make me realize I could get something useful out of all the schizophrenic's rantings. I almost considered it a desecration to actually hate this book which so many people consider life-changing. I made up excuses with myself: That maybe I am a phony myself or that I am too damn old to read it. I should have read it when I was a tad bit younger as most people did. Fourteen or fifteen. But then I remembered that Salinger intended this to be a novel for adults, for chrissake.I actually could not settle on what I disliked about it, but I was quite positive that I disliked Holden Caulfield. Nay, hated him. Detested. Loathed. Abhored. He was himself the phony hypocrite he so disgusted. Such immature, fickle-minded, coward sunovabitch who wastes his daddy's dough. In his eyes, there was always something hateful and ""phony"" with everybody and everything. I again tried making excuses that it might have been the intention of J.D. Salinger all along: To hate the hypocrite who hates on other hypocrites. If that was the case, I could have given this book at least four stars for establishing and delivering its purpose effectively.All the while I kept on associating this book with the other coming-of-age works such as Norwegian Wood (which for me was way better), or with something as conceited and character-centered as it was like A Portrait of the Artist as Young Man. The one positive thing I hauled out of this heap was its diction. The diciton was probably the only decent asset of this book, though the book reeked of too much character and ""I"" on every single page. With that I was not able to feel the setting objectively because of the shitty descriptions Holden gives. The reader could really tell who was speaking. The slang , choice of topic and offensive language were proof enough that the narrator was just a youngster. I never read Salinger's other books for comparison purposes, though. Although the diction was established, I hated the overly-casual language itself. This might be a problem of personal preference. There are certain parameters I kept on looking in a novel, and language was one. I wanted beautiful words piled together suavely. I wanted a novel where I could learn to set phrases and sentences more effectively. I wanted something that would make me better in terms of vocabulary. This had none since it was supposed to portray the diction of an American teenager who saw nothing but his shitloaded world. It had nothing of that sublimity, this Catcher. It was no different from opening a random person's diary or blog then reading all the shit out of it. My hatred toward Holden Caulfield is the root cause of this 1-star which I in no way regretted in giving.While reading it I kept searching like a desperate blind man for the point, which I failed to unearth mainly because of Holden's too much ranting and the overflowing use of the stream-of-consciousness. Really. Holden talked of one thing then shifts to another and then to another. It made me dizzy. There was no balance, even on the words. He kept repeating them to the point of utter irritation and annoyance. There were certain parts I really liked and some rantings that were actually useful to the world philosophy at large. Sometimes, his rantings got really hilarious:""That's the thing about girls. Every time they do something pretty, even if they're not much to look at, or even if they're sort of stupid, you fall in love with them, and then you never know where the hell you are. Girls. Jesus Christ. They can drive you crazy. They really can.""I loved it in fragments, sure, but not as a whole. Maybe if I would be rereading it in the future my perspective might alter."
1125,Debra,"I hated this book the entire way through. The writing is well done but the characters are awful. I only finished the book because I was hoping the main character would die at the end. Sadly, I was disappointed in that regard. "
1126,Jo Goodwin,"Hated this book. Holden is an obnoxious little ****. I was entirely unsympathetic to his whining about everything being 'phony.' No idea why so many people love this book, but each to their own. "
1127,Chris Woods,Without a doubt the worst book I've ever read. I would give it less than 1 star if possible. I picked this book up for a quarter at a garage sale and I feel that I got ripped off. There is nothing positive I can say about this piece of crap. 
1128,Darragh E,"**Originally posted on The Fault in Our Words (http://www.faultinour-words.com/).**The Catcher in the RyeJ.D. SalingerPages: 201Format: PaperbackSource: Local bookstoreRecently, I had to endure the suffering of reading 'The Catcher in the Rye' by J.D. Salinger as it's required for English class. The fact that the class read together and it took us about two months to get through the train-wreck that is this novel was bad enough, but what made it worse was the fact that once I had finished the book over the weekend that had been assigned for us to do, I had to read the last twenty pages or so with the class again because some idiots weren't bothered enough to finish the book to write their own opinionated review. And let me say that this piece of whatever-it's-meant-to-be was no better the second time round.The protagonist, Holden Caulfield, is indescribable. No, really, I can’t describe him, because if I tried I would have to throw my laptop at the wall in rage. I hated this guy. I mean, I get people are depressed and how serious it can get, and that it makes you more unsociable and judgemental, but this character was so morbid that Dracula would think him a jerk. Sure, he had his moments, like anything to do with his little sister, Phoebe, or innocence, like when he meets the two ‘bruddas’ (brothers). Holden, while even having his moments, was still the most-annoying character I’ve ever read—I have to say that I truly hate him and that if I met him in person he would be receiving a grade A slap across the face from me. The guy was lonely and that made him sad. He was lonely because he was rude and thought everyone a fake, or ‘phony’ as he put it. He was depressed and that made him sad. He was depressed because he was lonely because he was rude. Basically, the list of things he was went on like that. Sure, Holden Caulfield was well-written, and props to Salinger for that, but he was so nauseatingly lost within himself that I wanted to tear the book apart and light it on fire and watch it burn. I really did.For the plot . . . there really was no plot to me. A plot to me is a character/characters, and they have a goal, and the book is about whether they do or don’t reach that goal. There was no goal in this book, it was just Holden walking around, metaphorically thinking of children and how he hated adulthood, etc. And, yeah, sure, the metaphors were well-written and all, but that was all the book was—a huge metaphor for the loss of innocence, like the bit about Holden being the catcher in the rye and the fall from the cliff being losing innocence and entering adulthood. I think the fact that this book had no plot was a major problem for me. I spent €9.99 just to read about some whiney seventeen-year-old walk around? Hell to the no.This book, in my opinion, should never have been seen by my eyes (or any other’s). I just hope that I can forget about this sickeningly twisted reading material as fast as everyone forgot about that dancing dog from YouTube. This book had its amount of time in my life, now it’s time for it beep off. I’d rather read a dictionary than have to drag my eyes across the pages of this garbage.Rating: .5 stars~Sam"
1129,Haley,"I don't really know what to think about this book. While I understand that this is a coming of age novel, Holden is hardly bareable as a protagonist. His catchpharases get old and annoying pretty fast and he complains about everything. While I didn't relate or get anything out of this book, I wonder if it would be different if I were male."
1130,Joanne,"I absolutely hated this book! I don't know why exactly, but I couldn't stand it, not the writing and especially not Holden... blech"
1131,Robert Kincaid,Not sure why this book has so much notoriety. It is very mediocre at best. Or maybe I should have read it when I was an anx'd ridden teen.
1132,Kaylynn Johnsen,"Everyone talked this book up, it is on all the reading lists. It is a classic. It is crap. So what if Salinger can string some sentences together. It is a whine fest. Get the boy some cheese. Enough said."
1133,Ava,"I've loathed this book ever since it was assigned to me in 9th grade English. Not only is Holden possibly the most obnoxious character on the planet, the book is written poorly. No wonder English teachers every where feed this crap to high school students, I'm sure it's easy to teach. It's about whiny teenage rebellion. As a former whiny teenage rebel, I was annoying too, as was every other whiny teenage rebel. We don't need to glorify this book of whiny teenage rebellion. "
1134,Alison,"I really HATED this one. Sorry to those who love it, I know it's a ""classic"", but I found it extremely boring, repetitive and annoying."
1135,Halenka,"UGH! I HATED this book!! Holden is so freaking annoying. Yea I get it. He's messed up from Allie's death and prob that other kid, Castle and he's probably catching pneumonia or something hanging out in the cold in NYC in the dead of winter and ingesting only booze, cigarette smoke and coffee. He is so obsessed with how everyone acts like a phony that he needs to get over his goddamn self and realize that the world does not revolve around him and as shitty as he can be he still has an affect on others and should be aware of that. i.e. When he's pretending to be a hermit and how he says his mom will beg him to come back home- will she tho? If he's such a little shit who would willingly inflict him on themselves? Not me. But now you have to ask the question- is Holden that way because of the circumstances of his upbringing? Rich NYC prep school kid bouncing from one school to another who will most likely end up working with his daddy's law firm after graduating Ivy League (because money can make so much go away). Or is he super damaged because of the loss he's experienced in his life that has nothing to do with his circumstances? I'd like to give this ZERO stars but Phoebe is this story's saving grace. I like her. And don't even get me started on the perverts, rapists, bullies, and pimps. I realize this is set in the past and times have somewhat changed but, my God!!!"
1136,Ethan Milo,"Can I have my few hours back? It was awful. I can't see how anyone can read into anything substantial and life altering about this. It was a cynical, angst filled, hypocritical teenager calling everything 'phony' or 'lousy.' I am not someone who believes that there aren't facades of 'phony' behavior in every day life, but this screamed ""I DON'T LIKE HOW EVERYONE LIKES STUFF,"" was just awful to read. The writing style was awful, the message or moral was non-existent (unless being obnoxious was a moral), and I really just felt pained to read about a character I so despised. I did laugh at a few parts of Holden's sarcasm, but more as if I was laughing at the absurdity of a child's temper tantrum. There were exactly two pages in this book that I enjoyed, but I would never recommend this to someone. "
1137,Heather Peck,FORCED myself to finish this book based on the fact that it is such a classic. Was it purposely written poorly???? Not a fan
1138,Gizella Tóth,"Gennyes. Tetű. Hervasztó. Meg minden. De tényleg. Érted, öregem?"
1139,Camille,Didn't Like it to much. Seemed like too much rambling not enough plot. I don't know its probably one of those books you have to reread to like it.
1140,Zach Early,we read the book in my English class and the first chapter was ok but the rest just put me to sleep and for 5 or 6 chapters i couldnt get interested into the boook it seemed to get better after that but i dont like those typs of books and i shorly dont like being forced to read them so i would not take my word for the book lots of people did love this book and took a lot frome it
1141,Becca,"I think I read this one too late past adolescence. When many people identify with the character, Holden, I found him to be obnoxious and whiny."
1142,Monica,"Horrible, I'm sorry. You see whenever I hear of classic books, I get drawn to them, and I have read and re-read several, and even the ones that I wasn't too impressed by; had great writing style, or prose, maybe the story made me personally mad but it was a great creative work nonetheless.All this time that is how I thought classics were, that they were overall great books, and I understood why they were great even when I didn't like some of them, But then I went and read catcher in the rye.......Enough said. The two days I wasted I could have read The Hobbit, or my school books."
1143,Lan,i might be the only person in the world who didn't like this book. loved the name of the protagonist tho.
1144,Jake,"Oh my der god, this was one of the most boring books I have ever read. I tried reading it on an airplane while going to Hawaii. I got some what throught it and decided that just sitting there stairing at the seat infront of me for the next 5 hours was more entertaining then trying to read that book."
1145,Schaemtsichfremd,"I was Holden Caulfield's age when I read this book for the first time and even then all I could think was ""when is this dude gonna stop whining?"". When I was 24 I tried again thinking that I might only be able to appreciate this book about adolescence as a post-adolescent myself, but that turned out to be the wrong approach and I hated the book even more. I know that a lot of people adore Catcher in the Rye, and I would love for someone to explain its appeal to me. Can't guarantee that I'll become a convert, though."
1146,Caleb Beard,Could not finish the book. And that's saying something. Listening to the story of one whiny kid live a whiny life is not my idea of entertainment.
1147,Darth,"What did I do Santa ?Why did you leave me this lump of coal in my stocking?I am not sure if this was left by santa in my stocking or by the neighbors dog on my porch.The main character was unlikeable. The dialogue was repetitive - IT REALLY WAS.I got very tired of the format "" Pronoun REALLY is/was/did/etcIf I had a dollar for every time he used - It REALLY was, they REALLY do, I REALLY am, blank REALLY blank...I know this was controversial in its time, but I dont think anyone thought it was particularly subversive or thought provoking. I think they just had something against crumby fiction with excessive and meaningless profanity.If Santa leaves this lump of coal for you, shoot that fat bastard!"
1148,booklady,"Thought I wrote this up when I finished it a few months back but I must have been too busy at the time. I didn't really like anything about this book. The main character was bent on a course of self-destruction; the language was vulgar; the plot disjointed and the overall tone was one of despair. I started CitR several times before but never could get into it. Now I remember why. Well now I've finally finished it, so I can at least say I read it. I was not impressed. I wouldn't recommend it.“A cynic can chill and dishearten with a single word.” Ralph Waldo Emerson"
1149,midnightblooms,"I seriously wanted to smack Holden upside the head on every single page. Never, in any book ever, has a girl whined so much as this boy did. Grrrr."
1150,howsmydrinking,"I've read this book several times, hopeing that i could bring myself to like it, but unfortunately it was just painful to read."
1151,Stephanie A.,"I'm going to let my high-school-era hatred of it stand: I was BEYOND furious that a book with this amount of swearing was considered worthy of study in class. Frankly, I still am. That's literally my only takeaway, since it is terrifically dull -- too much swearing, a/k/a ""a lesson in why books starring teenage boys are usually a waste of time."" (teen girls all the way, thanks)Unfortunately, it also contains one of my favorite quotes of all time - ""She has about 5000 notebooks. You never saw a kid with so many notebooks"" - which I march around with as The Definitive Phrase To Describe Myself.Still not getting a second star, though. "
1152,Vicki,Horrible book. About5 swear words per page. Content not uplifting! I would rate it below a 1 if I could. Read it before my daughter. She was required to read it in high school. Is this the kind of education that is required?
1153,Robert Starkey,Do not waste your time with this book. It is easily one of the most over rated books in history. When someone tells it changed their life I wonder how they could get the old life back. I certainly would hate my life if Holden affected it so. 
1154,Phil,"The Catcher in the Rye has got to be one of the worst pieces of literature that I have ever had the displeasure to read. This book has hardly any plot to be found in it. If you are interested in reading page after page of an angsty teenager bitching and ranting, then this is the perfect book for you."
1155,Alex,"Hated this book. Nothing happens, and Holden is profoundly irritating, changing his mind about everything and everyone within a single paragraph, and continually saying he was about to do something, but then didn't feel like it. Maybe it's because I'm reading it for the first time at twice his age, but I found him completely unlikeable and unrelatable. For all his whinging about phoneys, he's the biggest one of all. And why did he keep trying to get taxi drivers to go for cocktails with him?"
1156,Vladimir,"Pues señores, soy alguien idiota e insensible que al parecer no tengo el recorrido literario necesario para entender cómo es posible que El guardián entre el centeno tenga tanto éxito. No entiendo por qué la gente lo recomienda y no entiendo por qué los expertos lo catalogan de obra maestra. Es la 2da vez que lo leo porque si la primera vez no lo soporté, una 2da vez fue desastroso, terminé odiándolo y definitivamente no lo quiero volver a ver NUNCA en mi vida. Decidí darle la oportunidad oooootra vez porque quería saber que es lo que la gente tanto le ve a esta historia, y definitivamente una vez más no lo encontré.Creo que una reseña bien hecha ni siquiera vale la pena de este libro. Fue una Historia muy tonta. Historia?? Donde? Es que no pasa prácticamente NADA de Nada. El protagonista tiene un vocabulario y una manera de pensar que desespera hasta la mas paciente de las personas. Las veces que leí: falso, falsisimo y 'jo' fueron tantas que si me hubieran pagado 0.05 Centavos cada vez k las leía hubiera terminado con mas de 1000 dólares en el bolsillo. Al principio la historia tenía buena pinta y pensé que iba a algún lado pero es que no, todo se queda ahí en la nada. Simplemente lo recomiendo si quieres saber que hace un chico adolescente durante un fin de semana, con un vocabulario horrible y que según los expertos es el vocabulario que usan los jóvenes de hoy en día también, y puede que ahí esté el problema... Es un Vocabulario que yo nunca usé y no me junté con nadie similar, dicen que hay que tener la mente abierta pero Holden puede llegar a llevarte al limite."
1157,Kris Chipps,"Though both my daughters loved this book, I wanted to tell Holden Caulfield ""enough already"" and tell him to get a grip! I re-read it in my 30s, and still felt the same. "
1158,Robyn Gesek,"I decided to borrow this book from a friend because it's a classic and I've never read it. I had a hard time staying with it, clearly I would have enjoyed it more if I read it as a child, rather than a 31 year old. But maybe not. The way the character repeats himself frequently, his limited vocabulary and continued use of the word ""goddam"" drive me up a wall. Also, the way he phrases his opinions, as declarative statements; ""it depresses the hell out of you"" makes me want to scream."
1159,Fernando,"probablemente el libro sea un clásico de las novelas norteamericanas pero la traducción a español de España es muy mala. Yo entiendo que una característica de esta novela es el lenguaje común y algo grosero pero la traducción en españolete es muy mala, el tipo con todo ""se la pasaba bomba"" o todo era de ""hortera"" y además no entiendo como este tipo nunca se suicidó, ABSOLUTAMENTE TODO lo deprimia y terminaba odiando a todo el mundo. la verdad leí muchas reviews de esta obra antes de leerla y tenía muchas expectativas que finalmente no se llenaron y ni que decir del final, quedé así :0 :0 como diciendo ¿y eso fue todo? la verdad no me gustó nada este ""clásico""."
1160,Cherie,"Hated this one. I know everyone read it in high school and loved it, but the guy just annoyed me throughtout the entire book!"
1161,Sere,"Overrated, imho. Maybe I had too many expectations, but I just didn't like it. No matter how much I tried, I couldn't feel anything for Holden. It was a pain to read it all the way through. I was SO disappointed. "
1162,Sera,"I didn't like this book and hated the main character. I've never understood what all the fuss is about and how anyone would want to emulate him in real life. As you know, this book is at the root at some real life person's desires to kill celebrity figures. I still don't get why."
1163,Susie,"There is no plot, or point to this book. It is literally a teenager rambling on about what he doesnt like about his life."
1164,Sachin,Poor book: Boring narration of frustration of author.Overrated book. Pls don't read . This is specially targeted at teenagers .And In the whole book the repeatability of the words is much more...
1165,Alec,This was one of the worst books I have ever read. It was poorly written and badly developed. The story and characters held absolutely no meaning to me. I can honestly say that the time I spent reading it was utterly wasted. 
1166,Bethany,I mostly have a problem with the character itself rather than Salinger's writing (which is just as excellent as this book's reputation deserves). 
1167,Moonchild,"This book is so boring, I don't think I can finish it."
1168,Callum,"Not once, despite the particular celebrity of the book: the history, the drama, the notoriety, did I feel like shooting John Lennon. I must remember to Google what lines in particular were used as evidence, and then be thankful that I am not that particular brand of crazy.Like most people, I have on occasion heard the book mentioned, in flattering lights too; one reference even to it being a favourite. If I had read this in my formative years, no doubt nostalgia would have polished this into a gem. But I’m not, and it didn’t. I think this is a ubiquitous high school text, in the USA at least, and I can only imagine a wistful smokescreen elevated The Catcher in the Rye to legendary status.The first person narrative come from Houlden Caufield who takes you through three days or so that prove polemical for the young protagonist. Along the way a few of his digressions allude to an inchoate sense of societal problems; little formative tendrils of what may become wisdom.A particular favourite of mine, and what is surely the pre-cursor to the Indie movement, is Holden’s distaste for ‘phoneys’ who talk so often about obscure and canonical culture they act to hide their real level of intelligence:""I used to think she was quite intelligent, in my stupidity. The reason I did was because she knew quite a lot about the theatre and plays and literature and all that stuff. If somebody knows quite a lot about those things, it takes you quite a while to find out whether they’re really stupid or not.""There is great scope for deducing the unsaid which, along with the breezy syntax, explains its popularity with exam boards. But exploring what might be referred to is not the same as a book that actually, skilfully, tackles interesting and provocative subjects. More often than not, the book reads like the ramblings of a petulant rich kid who doesn’t know how good he’s got it. And if that’s the point of the book, then why the bloody hell is it on so many ‘Best Book’ lists?Best part: The sleeve design.Worst part: Pages 1-192.Avoid if: You have other books.Read if: You are lonely and want to feel like someone is talking with you.One word to sum up this book: blether.For more reviews, see http://101greatexpectations.wordpress..."
1169,Marlan,"I think Book a Minute sums up the book pretty well:Holden Caulfield: ""Angst angst angst swear curse swear crazy crazy angst swear curse, society sucks, and I'm a stupid jerk.""And that's the book. I suppose there's educational value to getting in the head of an absolute jackass to see it tick, but frankly, I've got better things to do with my time. As for the ending, I found the ""epiphany"" shallow and overblown, though that may have been part of the point.So yeah, if I was grading this on literary value, I'd score it higher. But I'm grading it on both reading enjoyment and literary value together. And on this one, my enjoyment of reading it was too low to give it anything other than 1 star."
1170,KathyG,I really wanted to read this classic but after 6 chapters felt like I was wasting my time. Is there anything redeeming about this book?
1171,lori rowe,"I just re read this as an adult and hated it. I had to read it in high school and didn't care for it then, either. Seriously, you know this kid is messed up and in a diluted world, but it just goes on and on...depressing! I love young adult books, but this is not one that I think deserves to be in high school curriculum. Ugh! Waste of time."
1172,Greg Mirles,"Crummy. Everything is crummy. The wall is crummy, the people are crummy, this book is crummy. "
1173,Elyette Libao,I still have no idea why this book is so beloved. I could barely make myself finish this awful book. Just because something is deemed a 'classic' doesn't mean it's good.. 
1174,Jennelle,"O.K..... so I didn't actually finish this book and I don't plan on finishing it. I am not one to quit reading a book either, no matter how painful it may be...I always keep reading. But I just couldn't get passed the language...Was there actually a story in between all that cursing? If you have never read this but intended to at some point here is my advice to you... don't start. You will defiantly save some hours of your life that you will never get back again. Besides even without the language it's almost as depressing as the Bell Jar."
1175,Jayme,"One of my least favorite books ever. After I read it I actually read the Sparknotes wondering if there was some major theme that I was missing. Nope. And just to drive the point home, the Sparknotes summary was a much more entertaining read than the actual book. That is a bad sign right. "
1176,Ang ,I thought this book was a big waste of time. I can't believe that some people have to read it in schoool. The kid just prattles on and on and on.
1177,Zoë Bulboff,I am a big Salinger fan but i did not like this book. hard to follow and exhausting. I will re-read it later and see how i like it.
1178,Ayah Elhsaweya,I hate this book.
1179,Delphi,This is my sister's favourite book and I tried to enjoy it but I couldn't get past the fact that I just do not like Holden Caulfield. The novel is self indulgent and Holden is a character that I have difficulty sympathising with. I find him arrogant and it was laborious to even read his thoughts. 
1180,Ziad Tannoury,Worst book I've ever read. I would've liked deriding it in a gigantic review that painstakingly expresses my rage and disgust towards this garbage but reading it was a waste of my time alright!- Ziad Tannoury
1181,Aakriti,Pointless and absolutely clueless. You have no idea what the author is trying to do. I didnt even want to finish it but I heard so much about it that I figured something interesting might be coming up so I held on. So i grudged on to find that it gets worse! The first thought in my mind after finishing the book was 'what a waste of time'
1182,Jenylyng,"I got all the way through this, but it wasn't easy. I kept thinking ""there has to be a point to this book"", but there never was. It was just the continuous ramblings of a completely self absorbed teenage boy, with absolutely nothing of any worth going on in his mind. I was warned about this book, but just couldn't believe any book this well known could possibly be this bad. I was wrong."
1183,Stephanie (Stepping out of the Page),"I was incredibly excited to finally get this book, but unfortunately, it was quite a let down. Nothing spectacular happens and it didn't really make me think. The last chapter had about the only interesting statement in the whole book. It felt like a chore reading this and his repetitiveness of words (especially 'goddam') and phrases irritated me. I was very disappointed. "
1184,James McM,Just don't bother reading it you will be bored out of your mind and you will not understand it at allIf you decide to read it then prepare yourself for a waste of time and a hatred of the main character I would give it 0 stars if possible
1185,Collette,"Another classic that I just did not enjoy, but perhaps I was too young when I read it (sometime in high school or college) to appreciate the main character (who bored me). Birth of the YA novel, indeed. If YA remained true to its roots (apart from the adolescent angst that characterizes this novel) I would hate the genre. I may give it another try someday. "
1186,Barbara,"Forced to read for school. Many of the books that are on my ""did not like"" list were simply books that I was forced to read and I wasn't prepared for the worldview they offered. If I went back and read it today, I might change my rating, but having been turned off on it by school experience, probably will never choose to do so."
1187,Ella,"This is a story about a guy who likes to moan a lot. I cannot for the life of me understand whether I'm supposed to try and identify with Holden or think of it all as a precautionary tale.The plot itself is a predictable mess -- Holden calls up a friend and drinks. Calls a girl and drinks. Does something entirely pointless and drinks. I realise we're supposed to find some deep meaning in this, but personally, I think the author has executed it horribly. If I want to hear someone complain about everything and anything, I'll just find a couple of old people and bring up either the subject of health or politics, thank you very much."
1188,Elle,lol whatever
1189,Rose Ippolito,"This was never my favorite JD Salinger book and I can't understand why people love it so. My 12-year-old recently had it assigned for her 7th grade English class so I got to see it again. I'm not the censoring type and I'm not a Bible-belter but wow, I can see where they're coming from in this book - the protagnoist is a selfish brat and kind of perverted, too. The message is so muddled and I can't see anything redeeming about it. Like I said, I don't get at all why it's such considered to be so great..."
1190,Angela Bender,"I actually couldn't even bring myself to finish it. I had not read it as a student so I have it a shot. I think that had I read it when I was younger, the main character would not have irritated me to the point of not being able to keep reading."
1191,Izetta Autumn,"Spoiled kid has an existential break down - fueled by his own narcissism. Not only is the character irritating (though pitably so), the book is also not very well written. And a vapid character, even one experiencing a somewhat interesting angst, poorly written just won't do for me."
1192,Kyle Mortensen,Overrated and Lame. Your time is better spent learning to play the kazoo.
1193,rob,"Sucks. Holden Caulfield is an entitled brat with no redeeming qualities, which makes this a frustrating read despite its ""classic"" status.I'd give this a zero rating if this was technically possible."
1194,Laura D,"I read this because I wanted to see what all the fuss is about. I'm still wondering. Nothing happens, it's boring and pointless - although for some reason I still read to the end."
1195,Kevin Garon,"Unfortunately, I did not find reading this book enjoyable at all. This book was just horrible. Okay, this is just another novel that, in my opinion, never should be considered a ""classic"". Holden Caulfield is the worst character in the English language. This book just depressed the hell out of me and I didn't even like it that much."
1196,Burl Rice,"Why is it the more confusing a book is, the more popular it becomes? This was just one, long string of profanity with no plot."
1197,Angi,"A friend forced me to read this in college (I still have his battered, dog-eared copy in my shelves) and I hated it. The main character is a whine ass and drove me nuts! But when Austin is a little older, I will make him read it just to see what he thinks!"
1198,Bethany Paige,"Absolutely awful. I read this book a few years back and despised it. Holden was a miserable prick, and reading it made me equally miserable. There was nothing good about this book, and to this day I do not understand why any teacher would require students to read it. Being a future educator myself, I will never put my students through the misery of reading this (unless they chose to) if I can help it. It is such a Debbie-downer of a book."
1199,Joshua,"Total crap. I am not the smartest person, but I have to say that Catcher in the Rye is totally overated. The whole thing is about a teenager who is a total loser who can't have any type of relationship because he is too selfish. He is kicked out of boarding schools. He can't go home. He can't do anything right simply because that would be an admission to following a basic social rule. Total crap, don't waste your time, unless you like being mad at a fictional character."
1200,David Sanders,"What the? That is all I can say about this meandering, pointless, boring story that somehow managed to keep me going from start to finish. I think it was one of those things where you can't help but slow down for a train wreck. This is possibly the worst book that I have ever read from cover to cover, please do not read it!!"
1201,Noah,"I hate this book. I read all the way up until I had 10 pages left and put it down and will never pick it up again because it is a stupid book and plot. This the only book I have never finished. If you want a real downer, pick this one up, you can have mine."
1202,Shachi,"There is no plot at all, and it is a painful read as it is written in slang cover to cover. I am terribly confused as to why it features in so many top 100 books lists. Complete waste of time. Thankfully I borrowed it from the library so did not waste any money."
1203,Bonnie,"Ugh. That pretty much sums up the review. This book supposedly is a classic because it touches on the themes of teenage angst, rebellion and alienation. And I only know that because I looked it up on Google. Seriously. Maybe if I had read it as a teenager. Maybe if I had been a teenage boy from a wealthy, disfunctional family who had been kicked out of his umpteenth ritzy prep school and had one brother who had died and another who had gone off to Hollywood to be a screenwriter. I seriously got nothing out of this book other than the impression that Holden Caulfield must be the most unlikable protagonist in all of literature. If I can't sympathize with him or feel for him (and he doesn't even change, mature, grow, or seem to learn anything at all during the course of the book), then why would I want to read about his life?"
1204,Kathryn,"Do I have to actually read a book to rate it? Because I didn't read the whole book. I couldn't. I got through the first 6 pages and a few sentences here and there throughout the book. I also read the last chapter. I hated the stream-of-consiousness writing style. I guess it wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't the consiousness of an obnoxious teenage boy. But reading as an adult, it was more than I had patience for. Instead, I went to wikipedia and read the plot summary. I suggest everyone else do the same! "
1205,Roderick,"How can you love an pompous, self-conflicting, naive young boy like that of Holden Caufield? I don't know and I'm still asking myself how my English teacher can because I could barely bring myself to finish this book... If I had had to read Holden saying 'goddam' one more goddam time I was going explode myself. It's not his lack of knowledge, his naive outtake, or even his amateur one-sided dialogue that made me dislike both Holden as a character and the book as a whole...I still can't put my finger on exactly what it was that twisted my arm the wrong way with this novel but I can definitely say that I won't be recommending this book to anyone I know. I can fully understand that maybe it was the author's actual purpose to write a book about a bumbling teenager with no plot. But did it have to be so annoying as well. As with everyone else, there are things that some people simply don't like and 'The Catcher in the Rye' was definitely one of them. This book is going in the attic..."
1206,Debashis,"Is it just me or does anyone else out there also consider Sallinger's so-called masterpiece grossly overrated? Agreed that Chapman was carrying (& reading) this book when he murdered Lennon. Agreed that this is the book most serial killers would prefer to read, given a chance. But how do these 'distinctions' make a book, replete with curses and swear words, a great novel of all time? May be only psychopaths and serial killers can understand the greatness of this masterpiece. Others can stay away!"
1207,Amy ,This is without a doubt the most overrated book I've ever come across. An utterly boring story about an obnoxious and boring misfit which doesn't have a single memorable experience tagged to it. I have no idea why it is a classic for ya literature: it says absolutely nothing about being a teenager. And why was there such an uproar of censorship about this book? Maybe it was daring for its time or something (I still don't see why) but you'd think that the critics wouldn't be wasting their time by running after this dull book.
1208,Dennis Burke,"I guess I expected too much out of this book. I closed it knowing I would never get back the time spent reading it... And that sucks (much like the book).If you're into pointless stories that lead nowhere, then read this book. It will blow you away."
1209,Chelsea Murrell,I didn't enjoy this book at all. Was such a struggle for me to finish it. With all the hype around it I thought it would be interesting and eye opening but I was bored with the main character and his attitude extremely quickly. 
1210,Al Borland,"i realized i've been reading this book for a year and a half after i referenced it in another review and i realize through that reference why that is. the catcher in the rye is a highly temporal novel. you have to read it at the right time, the right age, the right decade...my timing wasn't right. i probably would have loved it in eighth grade during my enlightenment and then maybe hated it as i re-read in college, but if i'm really struggling to get through it now, maybe it's not worth it. not to say i will never read it. and giving a one-star rating seems unnecessary because it's a considered a classic or whatever, but i know there will be thousands of other people giving it inflated ratings from the one time they were forced to read it in high school and it like, opened my eyes or like, just ~~got me."
1211,Kathy McDowell (Ryan) Miller,"I though this book was going to be swell because it's a classic and all, but it was lousy. I'm not into this type of God damn book, I'm really not. I didn't like the way that moron Salinger kept calling all the damn females old and all. Stupid books that don't have a God damn plot and all just kill me. God damn boring and depressing as hell. "
1212,El Nick,Caulfield is a whiny prick who would get punched hard by almost everyone in real life. But since he is a character he is now witty and insightful! its rubbish if you ask me!P.S I dislike any book that killed John Lennon
1213,Anoud  Alqahtani,So much repetition of words !! that's all what I can say about this novel. Nothing to be excited about let me tell you.
1214,Kellie,The whole book was about a guy complaining all the time. I don't even know why this book is so famous and why people love it so much.
1215,Niloofar,حدود چند ماه این کتاب را کنار گذاشتم که بعدا بخوانم، برای اینکه تا فصل 16 آن هیچ چیز جالبی برای من نداشت. بعد هم تصمیم گرفتم که دیگر آن را کنار بگذارم. فکر می کنم کتاب خواندن یک امر کاملا سلیقه ای است و اینکه کتاب یا نویسنده ای اسم و رسمی داشته باشد دلیل نمی شود که هر کسی از آن اثر خوشش بیاید. ناتور دشت برای من اینگونه بود! 
1216,Maya Luce,"Normally, I am very open-minded with books, but I felt that this specific novel held no real ""spark"". Holdon seemed like a ""flat"" character to me, almost as if Salinger never really bothered to flesh him out but rather kept writing and writing about him without revising. (Of course, that's absurd to believe as all books go through thousands of edits, but that is how I personally perceived him.) Catcher in the Rye was one of the very few school books I had to drag myself through to read, and I was immensely disinterested in the plot. "
1217,Bill Jeffers,"Congratulations, JD, you can say goddamn a lot. Maybe I was living the life of the miserable teenager at the time and it was too real for me, but I thought this book was AWFUL."
1218,Nicole N,"Well, thanks to the goddamn hype of this freaking goddamn book, I finally picked up this book for the Chrissake of it. I couldn't help but am very much the hell annoyed by every goddamn word in almost every sentence. I swear I could count the hell times the word ""goddamn, damn, hell, depressed, lonesome"" been used in this goddamn book --I'm not kidding. Or simply the protagonist was just goddamn depressed and lonesome for just about everything. That made me feel very much goddamn depressed and lonesome too, moreover, bored. Well at least I'm done finished reading this goddamn book. "
1219,Kbord,I hated this book. I hated the language in this book. I couldn't get past the language. The amount of coarse language was absurd and prevented me from getting into the story.
1220,Caitlin Chow,I honestly didn't like it very much. The writing style was hard to follow along with.
1221,Rebecca Snyder,"The Catcher in the Rye was annoying and dumb. Throughout the book, Holden, the main character, makes stupid decisions. He constantly refers to people as ""phony,"" which is extremely annoying. I thought the writing was okay, but it was told in Holden's point of view, so it was a little unreliable. I would suggest this to people who want to read a dumb, annoying, and boring book that will make them want to throw it against the wall."
1222,Alan Jordan," So I go back in time and finally read this ""American Classic"". It would be difficult for me to relate to anyone exactly how much I disliked this book and it's main character Holden Caulfield.Perhaps I'm just not getting it but I felt the writing style itself is very sophomoric and repetitive. As for Holden I see him as a whiny little rich kid trying to act like a grownup. As he goes through the story repeating,way to often.that he hates ""phonies"" he is constantly lying and pretending to be someone he is not. Yes Holden we get it, you hate yourself and everything you stand for. His constant drinking and smoking is annoying enough without his character ending every other thought with ""I really did"", I guess we were to suppose he was lying again. How oh how did this become a book that is mentioned in the same breath as To Kill a Mockingbird? "
1223,Taylor-Maree,"I didn't like this book. I am just stating. I know some people really like it. I had trouble relating to the characters throughout the novel and it was hard to understand the main characters reasoning. I know throughout the book I was saying that there was something mentally wrong here. He needs help. The way that words are repeated all the time was irritating. There was no real plot. It was about someone mental break down. That's it and they don't even tell you what is wrong at the end anyway. When I finished I asked myself what was the purpose of reading this novel? Apart for school? Don't get me wrong I generally don't mind classical books or books that I have to read for school but this one...I don't know. I had so much difficulty just reading each chapter. It didn't make me question anything, had no meaning and was (at for me) generally boring. "
1224,Kate Dee,"One of the most boring books I've ever read. To be fair, though, I have to add that I had to read it in school and I was young. So maybe one day, if I run out of things to read, I'll read it again."
1225,Joe Ragaa,"if there was anything less than 1 i'd give it to this book. this is now my standard against which all shit is measured. the amount of hatred i feel toward this book is indescribable by mere words. i hated the character, the story, the writing, and how people say that this book is even readable is beyond me. wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy."
1226,Wazz,"A short book but I struggled with it on the morning train from East Grinstead to London. I think on the second morning at Clapham Junction I gave up on it. Much ado about nothing. This is regarded as a 'great' book but that probably says a lot about society's current standards. Of course there are intellectuals who will tell me I missed the point. But as far as an examination of someone's inner self is concerned, it does what so much literaure does, pondering how unfathomable life is and how incomprehnsible people are without offering any real insight. Yes, yes,okay, I missed the point."
1227,Lindsay Holmes,"I know this is a classic that any true reader should be able to appreciate, I can't. I put it down midway because I disliked it so much. The main character irritated and grated on me, and I felt no sympathy for any of the characters in the story. I just didn't like this one."
1228,Merpati98,"I've had a feeling many confused young people, teenagers, will get their justification if they read this. Which is no good. Because Holden is the most pony of them all, and you shouldn't feel proud relating to him. I admit he'd got a point sometimes, but still he didn't have any right to judge anything even less cursing the world, God, and other so much. I think he was actually fairly similar to other characters about their poniness. He liked to lie, spouting bull, nonsense without guilt, hotheaded, had short-temper, someone who said he was pacifist when he often pick a fight, and a weakling who liked to blame anyone/anything else without checking if he was the one at fault or not. He whined about the ugliness of the world, of people, but didn't do any good things either. He was a hypocrite and good-for-nothing. "
1229,Linnea,"I haven't finished it, but I'm never going to finish it, so I'll just say that I finished it to get it away from my Currently Reading"
1230,Susan,"I know this is supposed to be one of the greats, but personally, I didn't like it. I thought Holden Cauffield was as phony and pretentious as the people he put down. Also, too much use of ""gd"" in every other sentence. When one word is used SO frequently that it distracts you from the story and you start keeping a mental tally of how many times it's used, that's just not good writing. Sorry everybody who loved it -- it would never make my top 100."
1231,Charlie,"This was a bitter disappointment. I heard it was a classic but it certainly didn't live up to my expectations. The narrative was boring for the most part, with only two interesting moments that I can think of. All that really happens is Holden Caulfied wondering around New York for a few days. While Holden himself is an interesting character, he never does anything meaningful. He has crazy ideas but never acts on them. This book would have been a far better read had the main character actually acted on his plans. My real problem with the book is that is ultimately felt pointless. Once I had finished the book, I felt like I had wasted 192 pages. Was Holden changed or did he learn anything from his experiences? The last chapter implies that he's still exactly the same person that he was at the beginning, not altered in the slightest. I find it hard to believe that this was the same book that inspired John Lennon's killer. I suggest you don't read this, you won't be missing anything. "
1232,Sylvester,"A nihilistic story about a foul mouthed, selfish, compulsive lying, jealous, impulsive, narcissistic, spoiled, pretentious lecher with inferiority complex. Sure, it had a very realistic narrative but man oh man how infuriating the story was. Pretty sure Holden has borderline personality disorder or something, cuz no one can be as vile and disgusting as this being. How is this even a popular choice of reading for schools? It's terrifyingly bad, but I'd admit it made me chuckle a little bit at his misfortune, kinda schadenfreude.What even was the point of the story? Adolescence is tough? Well suck it up, don't be a moron and you won't get into trouble. The world doesn't revolve around you Holden, get over yourself.I don't even understand his weird obsession with the ducks, there is no allegory with it, it just makes me angry."
1233,Paula Scott,"A spoiled kid drops out of school, wanders around the city, whining that everyone else is fake while lying to everyone and trying to get drunk. The book skipped over how he ended up in a psych ward, which would have presumably been the most interesting part of the story."
1234,Patti,"Guess I'm just a long way from being a teenager, but this book, which recounts in excrutiating detail 2 days in the life of Holden Cauldfield just didn't work for me. I suppose it is a pretty good representation of life from a 16-year-old's point of view (constantly depressed, hates everything and everyone), but I found it neiher a pleasure to read nor insightful, just kind of depressing."
1235,Brandy French,"Just didn't do it for me. Never got interested. Holden Caulfield just didn't seem rebellious or badass, he seemed whiney."
1236,Russ,"God, what a disappointing read. I remember this being the bane of so many people because it was a HS reading assignment. Talk about much ado about nothing."
1237,Spencer,"This book really didn't do anything for me.I understand it's the views of a depressed teenager and it conveyed that well but the way he keeps repeating himself is sooo annoying, and all. It is such a non-story it's no wonder it nearly took me a year to battle through the monotonous repetitive world of Holden Caulfield.I actually stopped reading the book a few times to read others."
1238,Patty,"No interest in this character, or in continuing this book. After 50 pages of whining, Caulfield has left the school... and I am moving on to other more interesting stories."
1239,Jeff M,"It's a book about nothing, with an unlikeable character who does nothing. Maybe it's just that I really could not relate with the character, but I struggle to find any depth to the character or the story at all."
1240,Swati Damle,I don't know what was going on. I read more than 50 pages and I was done. Nothing to rave about honestly. 
1241,Shilpa,"WARNING: Don't read this review if you are a fan of this book.Finally I managed to finish this godforsaken book. This is a book of polarizing nature. You either love it or hate it. I for one, hated it. I hated everything about it. The narration, the protagonist, vocabulary, plot (if there's any), everything! The protagonist, Holden Caulfield spends half his life begging almost every stranger to accompany him for drinks. He is a lonely dope who gets kicked out of his school for flunking in almost every subject. He practically asks every person he meets to have a drink with him. Pathetic! And no one agrees to accompany him (not everyone is as jobless as Holden, right?) Now coming to his vocabulary. Technically, it's J.D. Salinger who needs to be blamed for the vocabulary. He used the word 'goddam' like a madman (I'm sorry J.D but you did. And I apologize to the fans of J.D too. What to do? I really hated this book). You can't go about one page without coming across the word 'goddam' ATLEAST five times. Seriously! The only positive thing about this book was - I couldn't abandon it despite hating it. I had to complete it. I don't usually sit through a boring novel. But surprisingly I sat through this one. Perhaps, I was just curious to know how much more pathetic Holden's life could get. The narration is so repetitive that you get tired of it. Even a disgustingly unhygienic character like Robert Ackley seemed wiser than Holden. "
1242,Clark,"I will never understand why people like this book. I totally get the concept of being lost and alienated, but I can't seem to connect to this novel on even a basic level. Boo."
1243,Justine,"I sincerely dislike this book. I'm sure it has lots of symbolism and stuff, but I wasn't reading this for class and it just kind of was a book about a really well off kid who is complaining the everything sucks and everybody sucks and wehh I'm rich and don't know what to do with my self. That's the book in a nutshell for me."
1244,Tommie,"I get it.It was a bold statement in the early 50's, a book that portrayed real life, displayed the vented spleen of youth, and gave generations of High School students the chance to see the word ""Fuck"" in an assigned-reading book.I can see the metaphor clearly, how that whiny little snot Holden can relate so well to every generation of young people. I even get the Catcher thing, and how Phoebe becomes the Catcher by the time it all ends, and so on. I even get why the Lennon assassination movie is called Chapter 27.That said, I still have to say that this was one of the worst reading experiences of my life. Holden was one of the least-likable characters I've ever met. He hates everything. He complains about everything. He shifts dramatically from nice guy to bitchy little worm with such speed the pages have whiplash. He redeems himself in the end, to a point, but it doesn't change the fact that I'm so sick of his malaise by then that I've grown a healthy thicket of it myself.This book was a brilliant example of how 214 pages can seem like 1,214 pages.I know it means a lot to a great number of people. Maybe it's true: the book doesn't really speak to you after you reach a certain age. I don't have to have flowery language in my classics...but I appreciate a story, and didn't find one worth reading here."
1245,Naomi,"This probably makes me uncool because I know this is a classic, but I don't care. This book made me want to kill myself."
1246,Mumsicle,re-read it last year and still didn't 'get' why it is/was such a pivotal thing. found it a bit of a drawling scape - maybe it's because i'm not a boy!
1247,Forrest,My ode to The Catcher in the Rye . . .http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baExq6...Listen carefully to the brilliant chorus after the second verse. It clearly expresses my true feelings about Holden Caulfield . . . 
1248,Joao,Boring book about a boring guy who lives a boring life.
1249,Christopher John,"Catcher is a fine book if you read it at the right time. If I would've picked it up in high school like most people I know, I probably would've enjoyed it immensely. I couldn't finish it when I tried in the last year of undergrad..."
1250,Timothy Juhl,"I desperately wanted to like this book. It had been on my literary reading radar for years. Perhaps I waited too long.I'm no stranger to reading seemingly plot-less novels, or novels that delve deeply into a character's thoughts and motivations, but Salinger's classic demonstrated nothing more than a monotonous voice of a generation that is now well into their retirement years.Each year, in high schools everywhere, teens are mandated to read 'Catcher in the Rye' and I suppose if you're 15 or 16 years old, Holden Caulfield might seem like the beloved anti-hero of your personal angst. When you're a man well into his 50's, Holden Caulfield is nothing more than a petulant, spoiled, rich kid with a limited vocabulary and in dire need of a swift kick in the ass.As a writer, I did have a brief crush on Salinger's ability to capture the voice of a young man in 1951, but that voice became grating by the middle of the book. What Salinger managed with his character's voice, he lacked in providing fleshed out descriptions of the era.I wonder too, if the book has aged well? While Holden Caulfield may retain his teen appeal, there are far too many instances where the book reveals it's age and belies contemporary reality. No where in our world, especially NYC, would a 16-year-old get into nightclubs and buy drinks, or get a motel room and all of it done with hardly enough funds to fill a gas tank these days.I suppose this book has its place in the pantheon of English literature, but it will not find a space on my bookshelf. I can now claim to have read it. I will never claim to have liked it. Even a little."
1251,Roxi Zilmer,Ugh - another complaining teenager - I already have too of those in my home! The point of Holden caufields rambling escapes me . . . 
1252,Valentina ,Sinceramente no entiendo por que a tanta gente le gusta este libro 
1253,Mikey,"Self-important, obnoxious, and repetitive. Tried it three times and hated it every time (if not more with every read). So not worth the hype. Ugh. What a piece of crap."
1254,Monique,i forced myself to finish this. i only read this because i never read it in high school/college like everyone else did. 
1255,Jolene,"I must be missing something...I know this is some sort of cult classic, and a favorite for a lot of people (sorry @krysta!) but I could not wait for it to end!"
1256,Carrie L. Hale,"Having a hard time getting through, been reading it off-and-on for a year or so. Not sure I'll finish it. Feel like I should, though."
1257,Shereen Mohamed,"How is this book considered a classic? And why is there so much hype around it? I absolutely couldn't wait to finish reading it, obviously because I couldn't stand Holden anymore.When i first started reading the book, i kinda found it amusing, it gave me a good laugh and thought it was interesting, but as i got through the pages, i found nothing but Holden narrating some useless details that - most of the time - didn't pile up at anyway and were all separated. He jumps from the current situation he's telling about to something that happened to him long ago.I thought there would be a twist or something but all i found out was repetitiveness (God i couldn't stand him saying ""and all"" every two seconds!) and profanity.He swore like a ""madman"" as he describes himself and almost all the characters. All of them are either bastards, phonies or morons.I read some of the discussions to try to understand, if there was something i had missed, what the moral of the story was, but the opinions didn't convince me nor appeal to me in any way.I got disappointed, i wanted to read that book for as long as i can remember but it sure is overrated and is getting more appreciation than it deserves."
1258,"S,","I've read this book twice, both times in Finnish. The writing is beautiful and I like the modern melancholy of the book - but really, this is one of those books that you'd like to love but you can't. Actually, this is an okay-ish book, but I had to give only 1 star to it as it was a huge disappointment for me and I can't see why it's one of those ""great classics"". Please, read and tell me what is so special about it.I'm willing to give it some benefit of a doubt, though: maybe it doesn't feel so special to a modern reader, because nowadays that style of writing and storytelling (oh yes, that's my other complaint: after reading it, I felt like there hadn't been any particular story) is used by so many authors. Maybe that's the reason. But anyway, the main character was quite interesting and I liked the tone of this book, but like I said, the book was such a let-down that there has been no bigger since. And thus I won't give this any more than 1 star, even though the writing was good etc. - if the reader's after-feeling is confusion and frustration and ""I want my money back, where was the story?"", the book can't be good, even though it would technically be a masterpiece (which this one isn't, btw, even though the Finnish translation was truly beautiful).I'll probably read this again sometime in the future, just to see whether I've just been mistaken and haven't been able to get the story and what it was saying. That's how much I'd like to love it. So fingers crossed, maybe the third time's the charm?"
1259,John Rauch,One of the most annoying things I've ever tried to read. Gave up half way through.
1260,WalterVB,"Had er heel veel van verwacht en is heel erg tegen gevallen. Heb het niet uitgelezen. Als je het lezen als tijdverlies gaat beschouwen, is het tijd voor een ander boek."
1261,Lacey,"All I can say is that Catcher in the Rye was a huge disappointment. For a piece of literature that, for decades, has been hailed as a classic and a coming of age story that people can relate to, I found it to be a complete waste of time. At only 277 pages, this book was a pain to read and took me longer than it should have to finish it. The main character, Holden Caulfield, is so utterly arrogant and obnoxious there was no way possible for me to read this book and enjoy it nor could I relate to him in any manner. He was constantly insulting people or complaining, making himself out to be better than everybody else. In Holden's mind, he is the only person who is intelligent and makes any sense or isn't depressing....dear God, EVERYTHING was depressing to little brat. No, Holden, you are depressing, the fact that there are people out there that can relate to your character is depressing and I hope I never encounter these people! In one chapter he will insult someone for not having a suitcase as expensive as his and explain how this depresses him and then in another breath go off about how phony other people are (this is another overused word of his, ""phony""). Are you serious? The only phony I see is you, judging people by the quality of their material things! There was another situation where he asked a girl out to the theater and stated how much he knew she would like it because she's such a phony because she likes things like that....if she's such a phony then why'd you ask the poor girl out in the first place?? Then right after asking a girl out to the theater, insults everyone he sees standing in line at the theater, what a hypocrite!! And ramble...can this kid ramble about such nonsense and for apparently no reason, mind you! More than half the paragraphs that I read was nonstop incessant rambling!!! It is an insult to my intelligence that this book is labeled a literary classic to get people to read this garbage!! "
1262,Danielle Barnsley-Cervo,"This is one of those classic books that I feel everyone should read at least once. I've had it sitting on my shelf forever, but never got around to reading it. The style of writing is a lot different, and the main character is rather random in his thoughts. I can't say it was my favorite book, nor can I say I hated it. I really just didn't enjoy it, but I can appreciate it. "
1263,Jack Rogers,It never came to a point. I never could finish the book. I was curious about the book since the Mel Gibson movie Conspiracy Theory. Would never recommend it.
1264,Astrid Stirling,"I really do not understand why this is one of America's favourite books. Nothing happened! It just narrates the main characters every thought and boring action the day or two following his expulsion from school. There was no obvious plot or climax, no resolution, absolutely nothing to make me turn the page. I am very glad it was a short book, because evry page was painful to read. Definitely on my list of worst books ever, which is no mean feat, as I have read a lot of bad books."
1265,Dan Stoneking," I am certain this is by far the worst novel I have ever read. It is quite possibly the worst collection of words I have ever read. How this is taught in schools is beyond my comprehension. I would have given negative stars if it were possible. I have never disliked a character so much, merely for there existence. If Holden had killed himself I would gladly give this horrible novel two stars! "
1266,Ray-Hsin Chang,I am 57 years old. He is telling me a story which I could not understand. But I feel like his fucking history teacher who I can understand.
1267,Margareth8537,"If it wasn't for the fact that I never left a book unfinished until I was in my 50s (when I finally decided life was too short!), I would have given up on this one.Didn't suffer from teenage angst and thought this was rubbish"
1268,David Christensen,This book was required reading my freshman year at the University of Alaska. I found the language very offensive...so offensive that for me it distracted from the message of the book. 
1269,Cory,"A drawn out focus on a depressed teen's perception of life. While perhaps some might argue the short book (almost a pamplhet) earned acclaim by accurately reflecting a youth's thoughts, I felt the focus was too negative and basically pointless. I would not read it again, nor recommend it to anyone, despite its presence on the ""list of classics."""
1270,Diana Toole,"Ok, so this is a bit of a lie. I actually never really finished this book. It is one of two that I didn't finish in my life! I HATED this book! I skimmed enough to pass my quizzes in high school. And I will simply never try again!"
1271,Lady Alice,"Non posso dare più stelline di così a questo libro per un semplice motivo, non sono riuscita a concluderlo e mi ha reso piuttosto triste.Non mi capita praticamente mai di abbandonare un libro, ma proprio non riesco a proseguire Il giovane Holden. Rimanere su queste pagine mi farebbe stare ancora male, mi renderebbe in qualche modo triste. Non mi piace rattristarmi per un libro. Holden è un ragazzo con tanti dubbi, è un ragazzo nel pieno dell'adolescenza e ancora non ha trovato il suo posto nel mondo. Mi sono ritrovata in alcuni dei suoi pensieri e spesso questo ha aumentato la mia ansia, purtroppo non ho trovato d'aiuto la sua storia. Questo non era successo con altri libri simili come ""Ragazzo da parete"" o ""Un giorno questo dolore ti sarà utile"", entrambi tra i miei libri preferiti in assoluto.Probabilmente era solo il momento sbagliato per prendere in mano questo classico, questo per me è un periodo un po' strano, devo scegliere cosa fare della mia vita, quale facoltà universitaria frequentare e devo finire al meglio il liceo. Holden in questo purtroppo non può aiutarmi."
1272,Ashlie,"Didn't like this book at all. I tried my hardest to like it, but didn't. This is a better version here."
1273,Julia Lanter,"I have tried now five times and Mr. Salinger just escapes me. Is it well written, yes. Is it fresh given when it was written, yes. But the main characters whiny tone just kills the book for me. Dead brother and all."
1274,Peer,Depressing story about a weird and confused teenager. Strange writing style: - maybe it fits with the main personage. There are to much repetitions and catchphrases. I'm not sure about the quality of the book. I certainly didn't enjoy the book and didn't like to read it all. 
1275,Ryker,"The Catcher in the Rye is the kind of book that draws you in due to its seemingly ""bad-boy"" status as a banned book and then bores you half to death with its bad story telling, and two dimensional characters. Nothing happened in this book. Nothing. There was no plot, and for the most part there wasnt even any characters. Sure they were there, but they did nothing, said nothing meaningful, and amounted to nothing. Salinger wrote the most idiotic, non-idealist, stupid, plot-less, action-less, and most importantly utterly boring book that has ever wasted paper, ink and mankind's time."
1276,Isaac Swift,"I wasn't impressed. I don't get why it was so famous. It's just some kid who likes to smoke, drink, swear, and talk about sex telling us about his life. And, his life isn't even that interesting. Nothing happens. There is no real plot to the whole book. It's just some kid walking around doing bad things and talking about why he hates everyone. And, he hates them all for the stupidest reasons, like if the don't have nice suitcases. I wouldn't recommend it. "
1277,Liran (Empress of Books),"Holden Caulfield may just be the most annoying protagonist of all time. With absolutely NO plot, The Catcher in the Rye was the worst book I read in 2014."
1278,Emma McGrory (Verity Reviews),"To be completely honest, I hated Catcher in the Rye. It's about as interesting as the summary suggests, and if we hadn't been reading it for school, I would happily have passed this one by. The writing deserves one star at best, but I'm not feeling that generous towards Catcher in the Rye. It gets one star only because of Holden himself.I spent most of the book wanting to slap some sense into Holden, and he was definitely not likable for me. He was whiny, judgmental, and one of the most annoying narrators I've ever read. Holden is obviously pretty messed up, and the only part of the book I found interesting at all is his internal conflict. I understand that Holden's internal conflict is what the book is all about, but it's shrouded in so much junk it's not worth more than one extra star. The writing is repetitive, to the point that I wanted to tear my hair out every time I saw the phrases ""that killed me"" or ""I really did."" There was little to no plot or character development. Holden isn't writing about anything important, just a basic three days in which he talks constantly about how phony and depressing everything is. Holden is almost exactly the same at the end of the novel as at the beginning. In the words of a friend, ""Take a novel, erase the plot, bring it down to a fourth grade reading level, sprinkle it with expletives, and you've got The Catcher in the Rye."""
1279,gingercarrot495,"Er... I don't know what to think.I started this book with great expectations, having heard that it was one of the most thought-provoking and well, 'amazing', books to ever exist. For fifty pages or so, I thought it was decent enough. Then...WHAT EVEN HAPPENED? Holden Caulfield, the world's biggest moaner and possibly most irritating narrator I have ever come across in my entire reading history, moped around New York for a few days. That's it. ...If someone can tell me what was so amazing about this book, I'd love to hear it. "
1280,Hannah Lesniak,Not a good book to read while one is already lonely or in a bad mood. Depressing. But now I've read it for the sake of reading it. How phony of me. 
1281,Lenadel,"Why do hey make you read this? What was i supposed to learn? the main character is just really annoying, swears a lot, and smokes a lot, we get it!!!"
1282,Lmcolombo,"Yes, unfortunately enough, I read this one. Only because I was in 11th grade, and Mr. Baynes said I had to. I violently hate this book. Didn't understand it, never will, don't really care to. I feel the same way about most of the Modernist crap that I had to read in college, too. Why couldn't everyone write like Willa Cather, or Harper Lee, or Fitzgerald, or Sinclair Lewis? Or is it Lewis Sinclair--I don't remember...."
1283,Sammy Nicholas,"Basically this is about Holden Caulfield who has been kicked out of many, many schools because he doesn't apply himself. So after he gets kicked out of Pencey he decides to go to New York. The story follows him while he goes on a date, and ruins it, then gets wasted, and insults many people. Honestly the book doesn't seem to have a point. This was a long, boring and tortuous read. If you can avoid reading this, do it at all costs. Holden is a really bothersome and whiny character who goes on and on about nothing and can't stay one one subject, and he hates EVERYTHING! basically its just a bunch of babbling nonsense. Overall I don't really have much I want, nor care to say about The Catcher in the Rye, but I did realized why serial killers have this as a favorite, but I have no idea why this is considered a classic."
1284,Tiffany,"Horrible, Awful, Stupidest book I've ever had to read for school."
1285,Susan Cooper,"Oh, jeez, I'm trying to finish this book but so far I can't stand it. I get that it was considered cutting edge at it's time and was a new fresh look at American youth, but holy cow is the main character annoying. And I normally LOVE teen angst. "
1286,Charity,"Another period piece. Wasted youth, adults against kids.The end.Salinger knew how to write, I just wish he (like others) had better content."
1287,Rita Kayla,DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. DO NOT EVEN COME NEAR IT.IT MIGHT BE A MATTER OF PERSONAL TASTE BUT I CANNOT THINK OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS BOOK.I CERTAINLY DID NOT HAVE FUN READING IT OR LEARN ANYTHING.IF YOU CAN HELP ME TO LOOK DIFFERENTLY AT THIS BOOK PLEASE TELL.(AND ME WHO THOUGHT THAT I COULDN'T FIND A WORSE BOOK THAN THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER!)
1288,Arthi,Done with Houlden's CRAP
1289,Ina,"I wanted to rinse my brain in bleach after reading this book. And during it? I wanted to stab my eyes out. I'm not even sure if words can express how much I hate this book. Holden is one fucked up child, and I don't care about his problems. He pretty much personifies the worst combination of human qualities ever. Not to mention, this writing style. Please. Stop. The only redemption is how Salinger manages to oh-so subtly develop the character. As much as I loathe to admit it, he did a good job of portraying Holden's unravelling. It's also no easy feat to portray your character as thinking one thing while boldly hinting to your readers what a hypocrite your character's being. It was almost clever, and confused me for a second—a second that I didn't hate the book because I was mulling over what Salinger had done. "
1290,Tom O'dwyer,"This book was actually such a disappointment. Everyone says how good it is, but realistically it is one of the most boring pieces of literature I've had the displeasure of trudging through. One star is even a little top much for it.Sorry to anyone who actually likes this :/"
1291,Renee,This book shouldn't have taken this long to read. I never read it in high school; maybe I would have enjoyed it more back then. 
1292,Ethan Madden,"I got about 60 pages in and then threw it across the room. I expected to like it a lot, but I just couldn't. First time I have ever ragequit a book."
1293,Adassar,I did not like this book at all. The main character was completely repulsive. 
1294,Callie Daniel,I have heard this is a classic and is well known somehow for it's who knows what. I couldn't get more than a chapter into the book and maybe because I didn't try enough but it wasn't good anyways.
1295,Sana S.,"I either don't 'get' this book or just find it overrated. I've tried reading it at various points in my life because I keep hearing things about how it has changed people, that it's one of the best literary pieces of the 20th century, etc. etc. I just don't see it."
1296,Tania,"Me empezé a leer este libro porque una amiga tenista me invitó a un book club y este era el libro escogido y mi mamá también decidió leerlo. Total no pude ir a la discusión del libro pero igual terminé leyendolo. Durante años he oído este título y tenía muchas expectativas sin embargo francamente una vez que empezé estaba deseando que el libro acabara; eso fué totalmente lo opuesto de lo que me sucede normalmente pues si el libro me gusta no quiero llegar al final y que se acabe. Qué tortura leer una especie de diario de un jovencito de 16 años que suena y habla como si tuviera 12 pero actúa y se desenvuelve como si tuviera 25. Su vocabulario se puede contar con las manos de los dedos y consiste en hell, crazy, depressed , and all después de cada frase, literalmente en cada página del libro. Por otro lado, fuma como chimenea, toma martínis, anda en bares, buscando mujeres y prostitutas, y en restaurantes desenvolviéndose como si fuera un adulto. Es sin duda un adolescente con problemas, en general todo le deprime posiblemente debido a la reciente muerte de un hermano menor de la cual no se ha podido recuperar. Lo expulsan de la escuela porque se queda en 3 materias y se escapa con la intención de no enfrentar a sus padres para al final abandonar todos sus planes y regresar a su casa. No me gustó para nada el libro. Pudo haber sido la sensación en el momento que se publicó en 1951 y puede haber sido un éxito entre los adolescentes que se pueden identificar con los problemas existenciales propias de esa época de la vida pero hoy día para mi fue monótono y aburrido seguir la historia a través de un problemático personaje, cuyo vocabulario es tan limitado y cuya perspectiva de la vida es tan negativa. "
1297,Matschmomma,Ugh ugh ugh. Why all the hype?!?! I couldn't stand the character which I get IS the point but really no redeeming character? And we are suppose to feel for him once he's in a mental ward. He didn't seem like he had mental problems.... Just asshole problems!
1298,Jim Razinha,I've never been one for stream of consciousness writing and this did little to change that. Can someone tell me why this is a classic? Because he used a couple of words? And teenager rebellion? Not seeing it.
1299,Janelle,Hated it. 
1300,Stacy,"I know this is a book we all have to read in school and is considered a landmark in literature. But I'm just going to say, I don't like Holden Caufield and I don't like this book. It's depressing. I didn't like it in high school and I recently tried it again. Nope, still don't care for it."
1301,Connie Hendricks,I didn't get very far into this book before I was sickened by it and closed the cover never to open again
1302,Ventsislav Kostadinov,"Прочетох тази книга, защото наистина е вметната неизлечимо под термина ""класика"", да не казвам и ""задължителна класика"", но за мен нямаше почти нищо, което мога да извлека като поука или някакво пó добро внушение или чувство. Сюжетът ми беше някак много статичен, репликите-суховати, често повторяеми и на моменти дори- тотално безсмислени. Единственият момент, в който успях да направя някаква видима прилика между сюжетното действие и заглавието, под което е поставена тази книга, беше на страница 158 където се споменават откровенията на Колфийлд за неговата бленувана ""професия' - да бъде спасител на малки и объркани дечица, губещи се в ръжта. Споменаването на баналното вече стихотворение на Р. Бърнс ""в цъфналата ръж"" беше за мен тотално очаквано и като цяло не подпомогна никак за това да успее да ме накара да я усетя тази книга. Наистина явно е трябвало да я прочета може би преди 5-6 години, защото за мен тази книга не може да бъде книга за деца, не само поради циничния си на моменти език, но и поради сериозната проблематика, която обхваща. Донякъде се асоциирах със злочестата съдба на Холдън, защото ""черната и бездънна дупка"" и изобщо фактът, че животът ти е една съвкупност от спорадични и съвсем неподбудени движения, без посока, без цел, без знание за завършек или дори достигане до някакво дъно или ниво, както беше и споменато в книгата, е наистина един ужасен момент, който обаче може да се превърне и в постоянен кошмар. Рядко рейтвам толкова негативно, но наистина тази книга не успя изобщо да достигне до мен, а съм чел доста, practically на такива тематики! А и наистина имах доста по-големи очаквания за тази книга като цяло. Просто тотално ме разочарова, но има ги и такива книги... :) "
1303,Katie Pedersen,"I hate giving books only one star. With that said, this book just wasn't for me. I don't understand what all the hype is about this book. There is virtually no plot. I can't even recall what really happened or if there was even a climax. The whole book was justI can see why I didn't read this in high school as part of our curriculum. "
1304,Ipek,Herkes bu kitabı bu kadar severken ben hiç ilgi çekici bulmamıştım . 
1305,Don,"Ok, the narrator is whiny, annoying, and lazy. I read it, now I'm moving on. I don't see why this book is so highly acclaimed. Oh well!"
1306,Emil,"This was the book that made me never read another book again in high school. I couldn't believe this thing was banned in schools (see south park episode for my exact thoughts on the matter), and THEN you wait THE WHOLE BOOK to find out why he's in the mental institution and it doesn't even tell you!"
1307,Eefje,"Everyone was telling me that this was such a great book. But seriously, I don't get it.. why is this so popular? The characters were so annoying and the story was extremely boring. I've wasted my time by reading such a terrible book."
1308,Oboudreaux,"This tale of a precocious teenager may have been saucy for its time, today though it falls flat. You hear worse from Kirk Cameron on the God Channel. I would be surprised to find this outside of the ""Young Adult"" section of my library."
1309,Cassandra Noelle,"I did not enjoy this book. At all. Why is it required reading for high schoolers today? It was completely filled with teenage angst and it depressed me.I've read it once, and I do not plan on ever reading it again."
1310,Natasha  (ar y ffin),"I got this book for Christmas and tried reading it in January. I couldn't get past the first five chapters. There was something about the main character that I couldn't get my head around. I know it's a classic, but I didn't think it was very good. Someday, I might go back and try reading it again, but for now, I am giving it one star."
1311,Kajla,"The Catcher in the Rye, the narator is a boy named Holden. Hes a bright kid but thinks everyone is a ""phony"". I didnt like that hes almost never happy and the book had no climax what so ever. He talked about his past as well as his present and thats about it."
1312,Jocelyn Lee,"It f***ing swore, every single sentence. It was a s***ty book that I didn't like. The protagonist is a b******, who whines and can't take care of himself. He doesn't give a d*** if his grades are bad. I hope that this goes to h***.F*** you, book!!"
1313,Laur,"This is easily the worst book I have ever read, and it's not that I don't understand it. I just hated it. Its popularity stems from its undeserved controversy. I can pick up dozens of better-written books focused on teen angst, and coming-of-age without wasting my time like I did with Catcher in the Rye."
1314,Lisa,A boring book about a guy who gets kicked out of school and attends many drunken parties. I couldn't relate to him or the story.
1315,Briana,"I love to read, so when I found the time to read this book, I was really excited! I had heard so many good things about it, and know many people who consider it their favorite book. However, I think I expected far to much. It was nothing more than the ramblings and whining of a teenage boy, and I couldn't get past that. To me, it felt like there was no plot, no story, just random thought thrown together into a book. Not to say anything bad who like this book, it just wasn't for me."
1316,Charles E.,"I read this when I was back in high school, over 50 years ago; thus back when it was supposed to be shocking and insightful into teens' minds. I found it to be terminally dreary and a long read; and that Holden Caufield was a pain in the backside suitable only for self-absorbed artistes.In my opinion, Bonjour Tristesse was a far better book! As a matter of fact, I'd rank it below even such tripe as Peyton Place."
1317,Becca Kelley,Not a fan. Just the protagonist complaining the whole time. Little plot. I know it is an American classic but not one I would recommend spending any time on. 
1318,Deep,"Completely nonsensical ranting of a frustrated, spoiled and insane 'murican' teen. 1 star only because of the stream of conscious narrative mode. Otherwise this book doesn't deserve anything. "
1319,Brock Steger,"I don't get what all the fuss is about. The protagonist is whiny and hard to relate to, the plot is rambling. The book is bad."
1320,Tabbitha Lindsley,"To be completely honest I hated this book. This is one of the worst books I have ever read. I understand how some people may read this and see the interwoven themes and ideals and think it is wonderfully insightful however I just could not enjoy it. Holden Caulfield is an egotistic, self-centered little wimp. He is so afraid of living life that he hates practically everything and everyone. Holden is one of the worst protagonists ever and he never changes in this book. He stays the same throughout. There is no growth, no breakthrough, nothing. I absolutely hated this book and thought that the ideals and themes behind it mean absolutely nothing if the character doesn't grow or change in some way. I can't understand why some schools would require this book for reading. Absolutely one of the worst books I have ever read. "
1321,Gaurang Vilas,This is an extremely slow book and is like trying to commit slow and painful suicide.Anyone who doesn't have too much time in excess should try to stay away from this book as possible.
1322,christala,"I've always wanted to read more American classics, so my dad found me a truly beautiful old copy of The Catcher in the Rye and with great enthusiasm I got to reading.I think from the first chapter I knew I would hate this book. Had it not been a ""classic"" I would have tossed it aside after the first few pages. At some point I remember wishing I could set it on fire. So I understand that this book is filled with metaphors and whatnot, but too many bad things overshadowed the ok elements of the book.First of all the horrible writing. His repetitiveness and use of words and slang I don't think anyone is used to made me want to hit my head on a wall. The truth is I dislike people who are like this in real life, so it only makes sense that I would hate this guy. I get it, you're a teenager, you hate this world you were so unjustly brought in, and feel you can't do anything about your miserable life but hate it. I'm not undermining his issues, acceptance and parents and fitting in are things we all struggle with on some level. But I absolutely HATE it when people go on and on about their oh so unhappy life and then don't do anything to change it. It makes me feel like they actually want their unhappy life just so they can continue to complain. I will say that towards the end of the book, there is a beautiful scene with the protagonist and his sister. I don't remember exactly what happens but I remember I actually enjoyed that part. Another thing I liked is that the story doesn't end with him resolving all of his problems. The story doesn't really end, I guess he just stops. Being a teenager is quite a stressful thing. Awesome, but stressful. Just like all of the other periods of our lives, there will be hardships and problems we will encounter. The key is to know that by bitching about it nonstop and giving ourselves a pity party nothing will change."
1323,Sean,"I am the only person on earth who hates this book! I hated this book a lot! I think that J.D. Salinger over generalized people's views of teenage life. Perhaps, it's because I'm gay...I have no idea. "
1324,Marazan,Couldn't finish it bc too awful. 
1325,Elaine,"Like a lot of older teens, I felt like reading this book was a rite of passage. In truth, I didn't really understand it. To this day I hate this book."
1326,J'aime,"Like so many, I had to read this in high school. It was the first book I read (that I can recall) that I actually hated. Maybe I just don't ""get it,"" but this didn't come across as some great example of literature. More like a day in the life of a spoiled teenage boy. To me, a classic should be a book that reaches many people, across generations and genders. This does not qualify."
1327,Jordan Smith,I really didnt like this book it didnt intrest me at all. It wasnt one of the books I would choose to read.The only time i read it was when we were in class readin it out loud. It was just so boaring his life weas so boring the onlt time i found it funny was wen he got beat up by the pimp. He cried like a girl most of ther whole book he had a boaring life story he had no friends he cussed and complained to much.He all ways critisized somebody then turned around and did the samething. It was so bad my teacher said she didnt even really like it and thats a big sign.
1328,Purple,"There is a book, sitting in my parents bathroom, entitled 'In the Beginning...' It's a great toilet book which consists of the first lines of many of the greatest books ever written. And 'The Catcher in the Rye'. It is, I have to say, a great opening line. From there though, it kind of enters freefall. Why? Why is this a classic of literature? Holden Caulfield is, I suppose, the then version of a nowadays 'hoodie', and every moment spent in his presence drags like a parachute. An extremely dull parachute which would have gone wholly unnoticed had you not been attached to it.The only saving grace (other than the opening line) is Phoebe. Now she is great and shines from the (very few) pages that she inhabits. Should this book have followed her around for a few days, and Holden been an ancillary character, I'm sure the book would have been far more enjoyable.Sadly, though, no. I feel for everyone who has had to study this book at school, and am impressed at any of them that picked up another book afterwards. In my early days of reading, this could've stopped me ever reading again. Avoid. "
1329,Nikki,"What a complete waste of time ""God damn"". Honestly I could not have found a book that was more of a ""god damn"" waste of time. If I hear/read ""God damn"" one more time I think I will hit someone. Boring, pointless and I have no idea how this book is so well received. "
1330,Gerry McDonnell,"The literary equivalent of 2001: A Space Odyssey: highly rated, but nothing of any interest actually happens. One for insomniacs only. "
1331,Diana H.,"COULD A BOOK GET ANY MORE BORING? I can see why it has its place in the book world as a ""classic,"" but c'mon, move it along already. It took me three months to finish this, and I can't believe I did."
1332,Ami E. Bowen,"A few spoilers and reader's opinions ahead....Now, I don't agree with the banning of this book, or any book at all, but with the references to underage drinking, prostitution and rape I can understand why parents of middle school age kids wouldn't be too happy about their children reading this before they've had a chance to speak with them about it. I don't believe banning a book solves anything. In fact, the fastest way to get someone to do something is to tell them they can't. Kids are notorious for participating in the old reverse psychology thing. Instead of banning books I think we should let kids read what they want but with the clear stipulation that whatever they want to read the parents will read as well and then, afterwards, a discussion could be had where everyone's questions are answered and fears put to rest. I was lucky enough to grow up with a bookworm grandmother who was more than happy to let me read what I wanted and wanted to read whatever I was reading and she always told me I could talk with her about whatever I read in a book. But, I realize not everyone has adults like that growing up. But, just because I don't believe in banning books doesn't stop some books from just being bad. Of course, 'good' or 'bad' is a personal decision when it comes to reading, but for me ""The Catcher In The Rye"" is a pretty crappy book. It wasn't bad due to the content or themes, it was bad due to the writing itself. The plot pretty much went nowhere, the story was mediocre and the characters were all mostly one-decisional in my opinion. Including special snowflake Holden, who seemed to regard himself as misunderstood and too good for anything throughout much of the book. There were a few vague references to sexual assault as well and in both instances Holden seemed to regard the act of rape as an inconvenience or an annoyance more than anything else. In one part he tells the reader about a double date he went on in which he could hear the girl from the other couple fending off the unwanted advances of her date from the back seat of their car and Holden remarked that the experience was 'embarrassing'. Then there was another scene where he reminisces about past close-encounters with sex and how it was never the right time or place and that his dates would often ask him to stop but that later on he'd wish he hadn't. So, in other words, Holden regrets not becoming a teenage rapist. Jesus H. Christ. For all the hype of this classic I was expecting a lot more. Basically what I got out of it was ""upper middle class teenager feels that he is special snowflake and misunderstood and decides to give up when things aren't going his way and run away from his problems and consequences."" Why didn't he just go home and face the music? It would have been hard but a lot better than running away and causing the problem to snowball out of control due to avoidance and procrastination. But, I guess that's part of being a teen; when seemingly insignificant issues to adults can be world-enders to teens. Anyway, I guess we should just be happy these days, full of computers and video games, when kids actually want to read a book, no matter what our own opinions on said book might be. "
1333,Emma Flaherty," The Catcher in the Rye  is one of the classic novels I never read during my high school career, probably because my school couldn't assign a book with that much cursing, so when I stumbled upon a free copy at college I thought I would give it a shot. Holden bored me as a character; if I wanted to listen to someone whine that much, there are plenty of other places I could do so. Salinger's book lacked, for me at least, the feeling most classic novels give me where it seems as if a great truth has been revealed to me. At the very least, now I can check one more classic off my list. "
1334,Andrea Dryden,I can not express how much I hated this book other than saying that its the worst ive ever read. No plot line with the most annoying main character who does nothing but complain about anything and everything and swear everyother word.
1335,Nichole,"This summer my goal is to reread several 20th century ""classics."" This was the first on my list. I remember reading it in high school and thinking it was okay. Wow, what was I thinking? There was nothing enjoyable for me in this book, and I rarely say that about any book. The writing was mediocre, the characters pathetic, and the constant cussing distracting and tasteless. I get the whole coming-of-age theme, but maybe because I'm not a teen anymore this just doesn't speak to me. This was a dismal start to what I was hoping would be a fun reading adventure. Hopefully my next one will be better."
1336,Bridget,I will always hate this book. I cannot even tell you why but from the moment I started reading it I developed a distaste for it that hasn't changed in the thirteen years since. Maybe I will give it another thirteen years and try again just to show I can be open minded...
1337,Domika,"Tohle je zatím nejhorší kniha, jakou jsem kdy četla. -.-""--- následující recenzi nedoporučuji těm, kterým se kniha líbila :)Phoebulce a Holdenovi bych nafackovala, ať se oba laskavě proberou.Zvlášť Phoebulka. Takový malý harant, to snad není možný! A její matka k ní vejde do pokoje  ""Ty jsi kouřila?"" ""Nooo... měla jsem jen jednoho šluka.""  V cca 10 letech??? A všechno jako v pořádku? Matka jí nic neřekne a prostě ""Jo jasně, fajne, pohoda."" ???-_- Ach.Můj.Bože. Všechny... a hlavně Holdena bych přetáhla po hlavně nějakou cihlou. -.-""A ten jeho způsob mluvy. Ostopéro??? Pokaždý, když jsem to viděla, myslela jsem, že si vypíchnu oči! OMG! ...do sebe oba mančafty řežou ostopéro....Stepoval jsem ostopéro....se ještě pořád sypal dál ostopéro....Kouřil jsem dál ostopéro. Hlavně mi prosím vás netvrďte, že TOHLE je román o dospívání a o tom, jak je hlavní hrdina ztracen a plný deziluzí.TOHLE je totiž knížka... aaaarrgghhhh... o rozmazleném frackovi, který rozhazuje peníze, hulí jako lokomotiva, chlastá jako duha a ještě se chce odstěhovat někam do chatičky na kraji lesa.TAK SE TAM PRO MĚ ZA MĚ ODSTĚHUJ!!!Já normálně začínám litovat toho, že TOHLE se dostalo na seznam mé maturitní četby. Budu prosit boha, abych si tuhle hrůzu nevylosovala."
1338,Emma Bsales,Worst book ever. It was a waste of 7 hours of my life to read it. All it was was hundreds of pages of the main character complaining about a perfectly good life and throuwing it away. I find angsty teenagers enjoy it a lot.
1339,Sarah Perdue,"I'm not sure why so many love this book. I read this in high school, which I was shocked they'd let us read. There was a lot of language, which I don't particularly care for. I'm sure this is why so many kids got a kick out of this book. I was never a kid that was rebellious so I didn't particularly relate to this. I know many that went through some of the same stages as the protagonist so I understood the struggles. Either way, I still did not find this book enjoyable or particularly enlightening. It was rather depressing and something I would have preferred to not read. "
1340,Rebekah,for the life of me I do not understand what the big deal about this book is. I thought it mediocre at BEST. The tedious innder whingings of a 20 something male.
1341,Michael Fierce,"The most overrated ""classic"" of all time  ...and I don't give a F__K about your opinion."
1342,Jayden,"nothing happens, boring."
1343,Sarah O,"If the words goddamn and phonies bother you, avoid! Very strange book! "
1344,Mychair,Love exaggerated teen self-importance and idealism? Then this is your book. Often thought Salinger stopped publishing because he was aware of how bad this book really is.
1345,Michael,"After all of that hype and all those stunned looks when I told people I'd never read ""The Catcher in the Rye"", maybe I expected too much."
1346,Emily Riewerts,I hated this book. The main character was so whiny and never seemed to learn his lesson. It was painful to read. 
1347,Dena Cooper,"I absolutely loathe this book for a few pretty significant reasons.1. NOTHING HAPPENS - there is quite literally no plot. Just a spoiled little shit who gets kicked out of school for lack of trying.2. Salinger gets so caught up in trying to create a realistic vernacular that he goes completely overboard with the ""I did, I really did"" Did you?? Did you really?? Okay...3. I can't relate to this extremely over angsty teenage mindset. When I was a teenager, I was much more mature and aware of consequence. Holden seems completely oblivious to the repercussions of failing out of a school that his parents are paying for. He has a general disregard for his future and a deep disrespect for the adults in his life.I honestly have no idea why everyone is so in love with this book (at whatever age they may have read it). "
1348,Salathiel,"I know I'm going to get slammed for this, but I hated this book. To me it was just about a spoiled rich kid who just couldn't get it together. I read this thinking it would be the end-all-be-all of books after all the hype and I was just disappointed."
1349,Dominic,"The Catcher in the Rye was a very long and stretched out book. The only interesting parts of the book were the beginning and end. I liked the beginning because you were trying to learn whom the main character, Holden, was and where the setting was. You were also trying to feel the character out, what his personality is like, and where the story is heading. Everything else seemed to drag. Reading about how Holden was depressed from every little thing just sucked the life right out of the book. It made it very annoying to read until you found out why he is depressed in the end. He was abused and wanted to leave everyone and go live in the woods, but he changed his mind to stay with his younger sister. There weren’t a lot of interesting parts in the book. There were a couple of funny parts but not much to make you want to keep reading. The only part I really enjoyed was when Holden got a hotel room, and when he looked through the window, he saw a man dressed in women’s clothes in another room. Then later, the woman came in wearing men’s clothes. I really don’t know why this book is in the top 100, as it is very boring and hard to keep reading to the end. In the end though, we learn that Holden is telling us this story from an insane asylum, and we also learn that he could have been sexually abused and that’s why he is always depressed. I think he could have been sexually abused because in the story, when he fell asleep at his old teacher’s house, he woke up when the teacher was patting his head. Holden then said he got very warm and sweaty and also said he had that happen many times before when he was little. In conclusion, in my opinion, this book is very slow paced and boring to read. It didn’t have much to offer."
1350,Nidhi Desai,how is this book in the times top 100 list? I am speechless this was the worst book I have read in my life so far anyway totally pointless I was so bored I couldn't read even 5 pages a day but I did it anyway in the hope that may be there is some point somewhere I mean it cant be popular for no reason. but it is. the language is terrible and certain words are overused and they drive you crazy by re-appearing in every second sentence in authors words they killed me (killed here meaning wanting to shoot myself in the face than read the book). hated this book. yikes.
1351,Robert Greene,"As a student, I HATED reading this book. I felt it's a book that was slammed down our throats from lazy dinosaur teachers who didn't keep a more current curriculum of truly great writers. So, with that said, I picked up the book as an adult to see if my feelings were still true. They are.This book is terrible. Let's start with, it has no plot. You can argue with me until you are blue in the face but this book has NO PLOT. It's a whinny, long depressing trail of some spoiled rich kid. I don't think students should be subjected to this book ever again.There are millions of great stories I would put into the classroom. This isn't one of them."
1352,emberzmars,Hate Holden. Find him so immature & irresponsible. However I might have enjoyed this book if I had read it whilst in high school.
1353,Sandie,"Let me count the ways that I hated this book:1. Pretentious (so very, very pretentious!)2. Tedious - the protagonist's inner monologue: me, me, me....oh and me, me, me.3. Utterly dull - who stole the story?4. Overhyped - Why else would anyone read it?5. The dialogue - cringey.Let me tell you now that if you've never read this book you have done yourself a massive favour - so why spoil that buy reading it now!"
1354,Rae,"The story of Holden Caulfield, a teenager. Highly overrated in my opinion. The language in the book and its attacks on the ""hypocritical"" adult world caused much notoriety and the book was banned in many communities. It still causes a needless splash. It seems that most banned books are not worth the time...generally not because of anything offensive, but by the silly content itself. Holden Caulfield is unremarkable to me. What's all the hubbub, bub?"
1355,Katie Graham,I believe I understood this book more and what the author is saying than I did as a high school junior but that doesn't mean I like the book any more. I can just see its value more. I will probably forever be annoyed by Holden Caulfield.
1356,Abby Morocz,"Horrible. Hated it. Couldn't even finish it. Another book that I can't believe people say is their favourite. I can't even imagine how teenagers identify with this book so much, but then again I wasn't a very rebellious and angst-ridden teenager.Holden is a perpetual slacker who has no aspiration in life and doesn't bother to enjoy anything really. He always refers to everyone as ""phonies"", is a compulsive liar, and hates people in generally. Honestly, I feel like he's the real phony because everything that comes out of his mouth is a lie.They need to stop putting this in the high school curriculum."
1357,Hannah Carey,"I love the way this review forum reflects my experience of peoples' reactions to this book in real life. My mother recommended this book to me with the forceful statement that it was her favourite book as a teenager, and in fact of all time. Coming from my mother, who loves reading but is never one to emphasise her experience with books, this was ready praise.I with much anticipation (being an angsty 15 year old also) began the book, and finished not quite understanding why anyone would bother writing such a thing let alone reading it! I found it cynical and angsty, but in a self-indulgent way that made it almost unbearable to read. Don't get me wrong, I love coming of age stories and I love a cynical teenage outlook on the world as much as the next person. But there is something so self-absorbed and whiny about this book that I just couldn't stomach it and it ended up being one of the first books that I can honestly say I truly hated.It has also been my experience among my peers, that women (obvious exception being my mum) seem to really hate it, while men seem to find that it ""speaks"" to them. Reading this forum most of the really bad reviews seem to be coming from women.I was wondering if anyone else has found this and whether someone can explain why this book is a teenage boys dream? There is also generally VERY split opinions on ""Catcher"". It seems you either love it or hate it, no one seems to have mildly enjoyed it or considered it an ""ok"" read. "
1358,Ram,"Oh, look at me! No, don't look at me! Oh bother! You are all so crumby, and so am I! And I'm in love with my sister, and also totally gay! Boo hoo, boo hoo! Waaaaaaah!"
1359,Fanni Dolgos,HUGE HUGE disappointment 
1360,The Shayne-Train,"This is the book. The book that people think you'll spooge over, if'n you like to read. The book that's sooOOOOooooo transgressive, soooOOOOOooo Gen-X, man!This book is a piece of shit. And I'm not just saying that because it was thrust upon me by an ex-girlfriend. She also made me read The Secret History, and that remains one of my favorite stories.Holden Caulfield is a punk-ass bitch. He doesn't ""embody cynical adolescence."" He embodies that dude you went to high school with, that was a dick to the study hall monitor for no reason, and liked to wipe his boogers on the bathroom wall while he peed in the urinal. I'd let Alex from A Clockwork Orange babysit my daughter before I'd spend a single minute with this over-hyped, chickenshit boy or the over-hyped, cherished-by-douches book with him as its star.Skip this book. Just TELL people you read it. Here's all you need to know: Holden says ""goddam"" a lot, gets kicked out of school, and wears a coonskin hat. Period. You'll get by on that. Spend your time reading something worthwhile."
1361,Aaron Vincent,"So that's it? All the hype about this book comes down to this?? I can think of two words that best describes this book: overrated and lame.The plot is really flat(oh. That rhymes. Cool), I even can't identify the climax. The whole story gets repetitive. And in all honesty, it has been an effective sleeping pill to me.The main character is way too annoying and ridiculous, if you want to know the truth. And his repetitive phrases like that gives me the creeps. Holden is a lame lame character and way too oblivious. I don't see anything extraordinary in him and I kinda pity the youth in his generation. I mean if they already consider someone like Holden as someone extraordinary, the people in his generation must be way too boring. And he is supposed to be a representation of the alienated youth? I just don't buy it. He alienates almost everyone and not the other way around. Holden is just not someone I could look up to. I have friends that is way more awesome than him. If you will compare Holden to the characters of this generation's teen fictional novel, I'm afraid that he will just fade in the background. I can't see anything special about this book so I don't care if a lot of people loves this novel. I'm just not the type of person that will say that a car is blue just because everyone saying it is blue even if its really red. I wonder that if this novel is published in this generation would it still be that popular. I don't think so. I reckon that it will be a major flop."
1362,Divya,"THIS WAS BAD.I finished this book because a friend recommended it. Though the book was 250 odd pages long, which is not that long, it felt like an eternity. I grew old reading this book. Why is it a classic again?Holden keeps complaining and swearing throughout the book. It is not even original after the first few pages. He is a rich kid hates everything. He hates everybody. The book doesn't even have good English, it hasn't captured anything from that era either.The only positive thing in this book was Holden's little sister who completely understood his insane ways and loved him unconditionally, nevertheless. But he slapped her on the face and that did it for me.Read this book if you want blood running down your eyes because your brain can't take it anymore."
1363,Matthenney,"Happy to give this a negative review. This book gets a lot of marks as people's favorite book of all time. For me, this book may have started my reading mantra of ""life's too short to read bad books"". Didn't finish it, never will. 1 star for you sir!"
1364,Tamara,"read this book on my hubby's recommendation. apparently I'm one of the few folks who don't love it. I think it's the dumbest, most pointless book ever written. A waste of paper. I never saw any point to it!"
1365,Liam,"I hated this book. It was unpleasant and took months to read, mainly because I couldn't stand to read it in large chunks.The biggest problem is that the idiomatic speech of the narrator leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth. Perhaps if I had grown up when people used that idiom, I would have enjoyed it, but good books should stand the test of time.The second biggest problem I had was that he could not stick to the point. Given that the narrator defends this approach within the book, I do not doubt it was deliberate, but it results in a lot of unnecessary and uninteresting information delivered in an uninteresting way. Divergence from the main plot can serve a purpose, but in this book, it only serves to highlight one of the least pleasant attributes of the narrator and protagonist.This brings us to my third major complaint: the cast of characters. With two exceptions, I found every character unlikeable, especially the narrator, Holden Caulfield. It's possible that this is a result of the narrator's stinted view of reality, but if it leaves me disliking both the narrator and everyone else, I don't find the fact that it may have been deliberate to be reassuring. Incidentally, the only two character I did like were Phoebe and Mr. Antolini. Only these two characters had any real hint of character depth, likability, or otherwise positive traits.I gave this book one star because I could not give it any lower rating. I wouldn't say it deserves no stars, but on a five-star system, I would say it warrants about an eighth of a star."
1366,Mersades Melton,"I get why people like this book but I don't understand why people ""love"" this book. In my opinion, it's just a whiny teenage bitching about inconsequential things. I can sit at home & listen to my younger siblings for that kind of entertainment. Although Holden goes to a certain level of extreme to enact his teenage dramas, it's still not this huge prize that should incite the chaos or inspiration it does. I guess ultimately I have to agree with Matt & Trey on this one, it's just not interesting & I don't like it. "
1367,Ray,I didn't understand the greatness of this book. I thought it was boring. Nothing really happened. Aren't stories supposed to have an arc?
1368,Chitra,"What do you say about a book that has 88 mentions of phony, bored (44), depressed (50), goddam (245), moron (24), corny (22), lousy (50) and the list goes on?I have no problem with the cussing, but Holden's attitude is so depressing that even Phoebe imbibes it immediately in her demeanour. She finds her dinner ""Lousy"", explaining to her mother thus:""The lamb chop was all right, but Charlene always breathes on me whenever she puts something down. She breathes all over the food and everything. She breathes on everything.""Even if I was a teenager, it would be difficult for me to relate to The Catcher in the Rye. It is pretentious."
1369,Rose,"I picked up this book thinking ""It's a classic - it must be good"". As I was reading, the thought kept coming to my mind ""it must get better or it would never have become a classic"" - this was the only thing that kept me turning pages. Before I knew it, the book was done and it never did get better. No wonder kids in school don't read much - teachers keep doling out these awful books and telling them that this is an example of great literature - ""a classic"". If I had read this (and books like this) in high school, I would have stopped reading altogether. "
1370,Tania Nguyen,"Uncompelling prose featuring a beyond annoying narrator. I wanted to engrave ""pretentious phony"" into a massive block of wood and smack Holden Caulfield with it.Terribly disappointed with this ""classic""."
1371,C.W.,"This book has been autopsied to death... so I'll spare everyone the usual litany of arguments enumerating the myriad reasons why I hate this book. And I realize that ""hate"" is such a strong, emotional word to describe one's relationship to a work of fiction, but... It's simply all I have.I don't hate Holden Caulfield. Not at all. Most people go on and on about this worthless little shithead and quite honestly, that's the reason he's become so disgusting popular (along with this waste of pulp in which he lives). There's not a single rational, well-adjusted soul out there right now that wouldn't slap the shit of this whiny sociopath if he really existed...and I think that's the real point: He does exist. In some way, shape or form. But, that's not news. It didn't shock us in 1950; and it doesn't surprise us now.What pisses me off is that Salinger got away with one of the cheapest, dirtiest tricks ever: He (or she, if you believe some conspiracy wackjobs) totally screwed us. Granted, he got us monologuing and then dialoguing about adolescence and conformity and social acceptance and personal accountability. That's not bad. He should get some credit for having the courage to challenge us in that vein. So I give him one star for that. But soon, those dialogues became lectures that then became required reading that then morphed into actual college courses and in some areas--freaking philosophies! Salinger cheated us all because he didn't care about Holden Caulfield anymore than he expected us to. That sucks. He simply created apathy for the sake of apathy. And he laughed his sneaky ass all the way into infamy and reclusion. The fact that there really is no point to it, actually became this crappy book's most appealing attribute. And we, as a planet, have wasted far too much time on it.I think Salinger knew exactly how this was going to turn out. Nice one, J.D. I still only give you one star. Like you care."
1372,Llmeyers,"This is another one of those classics that I hated when I read it many years ago. If I re-read it now, perhaps my opinion would be different. "
1373,Michael Palmer,"This book made it into an exclusive club: books I could not finish after starting.I could not for the life of me continue reading this book after the first few chapters.In all honesty the first thing that came to mind was ""this reads like it was written by an 8th grader the morning the assignment was due"".The writing style totally killed any chance for immersion or enjoyment I may have otherwise derived from this book."
1374,Celeste Spangler,"Everything is depressing and everything is phony, according to this book. I tired very quickly of the repetitive, every-sentence-must-have-at-least-one-explicative, whiny style. I've read other reviews where this book is proclaimed as a treatise on ""the end of innocence"". This was completely lost on me, since I did not have the impression from the start that the main character had any innocence to loose! He already smoked, drank, and flunked out of classes. He was obviously from a wealthy family and privileged life, and appeared to be squandering all his opportunities. I raced to finish this book because I just wanted to get it over with. Thankfully, it's not a very long book."
1375,Anshul,"Well, I would say that this is the most overrated book that I've read and should definitely not be considered a classic.May be it reflects what an American teenager mindset is like, but I ain't interested in that. The story had no plot. By the end of the book I was just waiting for it to be over.I didn't understand what the problem with Holden was. For him everyone was either a Phony or a Jerk. I myself found him to be a Phony and Jerk. Also, he was very Pessimistic, Idiotic and Selfish. For instance, Why would you take a girl out on a Date if She is ""Such a pain in the ass"" to you.The writer overused quite a few words. In every page you will find a sentence ""That Killed Me"".After each sentence Holden would add something like ""I really was"", ""It really is"", ""I really did"", etc,. as if just to confirm that whatever he has just said was actually true. It was REALLY annoying.Overall Rating: Poor, wouldn't recommend to anyone."
1376,Joseph,"Swearing for shock value, characters with no truth to them, petulance disguised as rebellion; if the novel wasn't so satisfied with it's own supposed cleverness and philosophical mish-mosh, I'd think Salinger had been trying to write a parody of teenage rebellion novels. "
1377,Gigi,"Fuck this book. I consider myself a reasonably intelligent person, however it took me damn near a year to finish this book because it's so damn boring. I can't believe that people have read this and used it as a reason to assassinate other people. Don't read this. Go read the Bible, it's much more entertaining."
1378,Bruce Snell,"Although this book is routinely referred to as one of the greats of the 20th century, I have absolutely nothing good to say about it. It was slow, boring and completely forgettable. It was written in the voice of a 16 year old (disaffected) boy - and if the goal was to bring to life the wasteland that is the mind of a 16 year old (disaffected) boy, it succeeded admirably. The problem with that success is that no one in their right mind wants to spend a second more than absolutely necessary with that child - and that is true even when it is only a written version of him."
1379,Ross,"Unlike a lot of reviewers who had already read this book and were re-reading it, this was a new title for me. Any self-respecting fan of books should have read this at least once in their life, right? I should have passsed. Maybe I'm too old to fully appreciate the angst of youth or something, but I'm Gen X....weren't we supposed to have invented angst?Holden Caulfield is one of the most irritating characters I've read. The entire story was a stream of complaints about everybody else in the world (except his saintly, younger sister...no idea how she got a pass), when the guy is obviously a self-obsessed bore.Also, I don't consider myself an extremely intense reader, but somebody told me that the whole point was that he was telling this from an institution after being committed. What?! If that's true, I totally missed it and I have no urge to go back and try to figure it out.If you're ten years old and the thrill of seeing the words ""God damn it"", ""Crap"" and ""Jesus!"" still give you a bit of a thrill, or if you're fourteen and you're convinced you already know better than the rest of the world, then maybe you can read this book and commiserate with Holden. If you're not either of these, then save yourself the heartache."
1380,Cristina Baez,"sin fondo, no lo recomiendo"
1381,Richa Shrivastava,"Of all the books I have read, this is the worst. Such a 'phony' character. A complete waste of time this book is."
1382,Desiree,"Holden Caulfield - what a sad sack. Seriously. I think you either relate to him or you don't and I'm proud to say that I don't. And I don't think it's because I'm too far into adulthood to appreciate or remember teenage angst; even my teenage self would have found 250 pages of Holden's stream of consciousness enough to make me want to slap him and tell him to do something with himself. I started a game a few chapters in that involved keeping a running tally of the things that Holden actually enjoyed and it was an easy tally to keep since there were less than five. He liked his family (except his parents), he liked dancing (but only sometimes and with good looking girls), he liked helping children (if they were well behaved and gracious) etc. etc. etc. The whole reason I picked up this book was because it was on every single ""Books to Read Before You Turn 30"" list and after reading it, I found that distinction really depressing. THIS is the voice we are most likely to understand in our youth? "
1383,Terah,"I can't get past the bad language. It doesn't make me feel good or think about anything, so I don't think I'm going to finish it. I'm about 50 pages in. I had no idea what it was about, but it just seemed to be one of those books that a lot of people had read so I picked it up. "
1384,Rick Roemer,"Wow, so this was one of the best Novels of the twentieth Century? I had better find another hobby. I realize this was written over 60 years ago but the writing didn't do anything for me. RIP J.D. Salinger.ps I did get a real Bang out of the story though even though sometimes it makes me feel a little sad."
1385,Lorena,"I thought that if I was in high school, I would have liked this book more. It was impressive how the author stayed in character, but I could not connect with Holden."
1386,Monica Porto,"This is a really polarising story. Your either love it or hate it. To me,it is one of the most overrated novels I have ever read. Holden Caulfield will always be whiny little shit. "
1387,Geraldine,"I saw The Catcher In The Rye for 25 cents at a used book store. Seeing as how I missed out on the opportunity to read it during high school, I figured why not read it now. Oh boy, did I regret it. For starters, I never really liked Holden He was so pessimistic and whined a lot. Holden feels dull to me. The story itself didn’t keep me interested. I can’t really see where this is a literary classic, but to each their own. "
1388,Mareli,"Um, i didn't finish this book. I couldn't really get over how negative it was and that ever second word went something like this,$#!@&"
1389,Lix Hewett,"This wasn't good for me at all. I'm usually a sucker for strong character voices and faily teenagers, but this didn't work for me in any way. There was a stretch of chapters towards the beginning where I sort of enjoyed the book, and then it went right back to annoying and grew more and more infuriating until I was simultaneously reading and thinking up increasingly violent ways to murder Holden. His crutches grated and what happened to him wasn't engrossing. I didn't find him relatable in any way, which is saying something given this is a book about a kid who's disillusioned by education and is sort of lost in his life. I've felt lost, and aimless, and I have been a pretentious asshole who thought she was so much smarter than everybody else, and this still didn't hit home for a single second. The only thing I found effective was the emotional progression -- I could see how Holden got from point A to point B. But I didn't enjoy the journey. This isn't even about liking or disliking Holden -- this is a book that's all about showcasing a character and his development, and I wasn't engaged in either. So it failed for me."
1390,Angie Abston,I hated this book. Holden is SO annoying. I had to finish it because I was trying to understand why so many people seem to like it. It never got better and was a torturous read. I don't get it.
1391,Nina,"You either feel at one with Holden Caulfield or you don't. I didn't, so if you hate hearing people's problems or people whining in general you will hate this book.Period."
1392,Mondenouk,I can understand why you might want to go out and shoot someone after reading this. I did my community a favor and stopped reading two thirds of the way through. 
1393,Mark O'Kennon,Required reading so I hated it
1394,Chris Burd,"The quintessential ""coming of age"" story, right? I was never able to actually finish reading it. Holden Caufield came across as a completely whiny and bratty - and I just couldn't find anything interesting enough about him to continue reading.I really should give this book another chance."
1395,Em,"I read this quite a few years ago, so I can't honestly make a review as I don't remember very much. However, I do remember Holden annoyed me and I found it quite boring. I think."
1396,El,"I'll admit, I mostly read Catcher because of the heavy references to it in Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex (my favorite anime), and also partly just to see what the big deal was. People make such a big deal about this book. But it probably took me two or three months to get through it because I'd read a little and get completely bored with it and put it down.The only way I've been able to describe it to anyone since is that this book is what it'd be like if you followed someone around who literally had no internal monologue, and said *every* thought that went through their head, from the most inane, mundane things, to the philosophical. Seriously. It's a story about nothing, or at least that's what I was able to take away from it. I found myself surprised when I did finally reach the end, because *nothing happened*.Surprisingly, I don't hate it. I'm glad I read it, for both the cultural and pop-cultural contexts, and just to say that I have. But it felt utterly pointless to have bothered with it at all."
1397,Suzanne,"I read this book after many years of people saying ""oh, like Holden Caulfield, in Catcher in the Rye?"". I have come to the conclusion that inside the mind of crazy people is not somewhere that I need to be. "
1398,Maggie Wiggins,"I didn't read this title until graduate school, so perhaps I missed my chance to become a fan. After years of hearing great things about this title, I sat down and read it in one sitting. A few thoughts occurred to me:-The main character isn't interesting or likable enough for me to care about him or his plot. I don't identify with him and I don't like him.-This reminds me of The Bell Jar for boys. Angst-y classics that are trendy to carry around in your back pocket-Why does this resonate with so many people? Is it generational? It wasn't for me, but I'm glad that other people find a friend in it. I'll certainly recommend it. Readalikes: Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath, The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton, King Dork by Frank Portman"
1399,Shri Murthy,"I picked up the novel the Catcher in the Rye, by J. D. Salinger after hearing many positive opinions and reviews. Sadly, the Catcher in the Rye did not live up to expectations and it may possibly be the worst book I have ever read. I had rather high expectations, as Catcher in the Rye is widely regarded as a classic and included in The Catcher in the Rye is on the list of the Top 100 books since 1920, however this book was an utter disappointment. I will say, I have never read anything remotely like the Catcher in the Rye, and hopefully I never will again. Salinger writes a mundane and lifeless story that contains no true plot, whose main character is horribly lacking, and is mind-numbingly repetitive. 	The Catcher in the Rye tells the story of the overly cynical, immature and self-pitying Holden Caulfield. The story begins with Holden making excuses as to why he flunked, and using the historically lazy and apathetic reason of “I don`t care.” This is his fourth school to get kicked out of. He later gets in an argument with his roommate over a girl; that being said he didn`t even bother going to say hello to the girl in question. After than Holden travels to New York where he wanders and gets drunk and attempts to get with five or six different women. He is rejected by all of them and he eventually goes and sneaks into his house where he talks to his sister, yet only succeeds in upsetting her. He then stays at former teacher house for a bit, then decides he going to move out west, and ends the story by saying “he`s tired of writing.” 	The book did not follow any story line, or at least I could not make heads or tails of it. Holden is the narrator and he doesn`t really do anything save whine about how horrible the world and everyone in it are. There is no climax or turning point in the novel, just a continuous onslaught of complaints and so called “misfortunes”. Holden goes through the book getting in fights, getting drunk, and attempting to get a girl, (which he fails miserably at); all the while hypocritically complaining of others who do so. His life and the book mirror each other in that both meander aimlessly, he goes on random dates, and goes through varying phases that could only be described as mood swings. I went through, page by page, waiting for something to actually happen, yet I was disappointed. Holden successfully manages to do absolutely nothing in the two hundred and twenty page book, save judging others. 	The main character, who is somehow both the protagonist and antagonist, Holden Caulfield does not develop at all through the book. He has an overwhelming sense of discontent despite being rather well off, and is completely apathetic towards almost everything. His attitude which seems to truly be his only problem stays the same the entire book. You could truly read this novel back to front and not know the difference save that it would differ grammatically. 	The book was also mind numbingly repetitive in more ways than one. The plot is pretty much as follows. Holden gets in a fight Holden has a drink. Holden tries to get a girl. Holden has a drink. Holden tries to get another girl. Holden drinks. Holden gets in another fight. Holden drinks. Holden calls up a girl. Holden drinks. Holden calls another girl. Holden gets drunk. Holden calls a girl. Congratulations you now have the summary to the first two hundred pages of this book. In Holden’s mind every single person save himself, and his sister are “phony’s,” and he manages to assure that we are made aware of this notion. If that is not drastic enough take the three-hundred and ninety-five instances in which Holden uses the phrase ""and all"" in this 277 page book.	The Catcher in the Rye was a sheer waste of paper and I personally would not recommend it to anyone. The novel has absolutely no plot, no character development and is exceedingly monotonous. I truly could not find one positive aspect of the entire book. Going through each page hoping some redeeming quality that never appeared was an endeavor. I will say that the language was mildly interesting; it was quite impressive how Salinger managed to use a swear at least once every sentence,(not joking Holden says God@#$ two-hundred and forty-five times). I would not wish anyone the fate of suffering through this book. "
1400,Firehawk,"I took this book very slowly, reading about a chapter or even less a day. And so, the mood I was in while reading ranged from happy days to sad days to tired days etc. And i realized that if I picked up this book on a particularly bad day where i was just feeling very sad and depressed, I found that I could relate to Houlden and I found his pessimistic attitude tolerable. However, more days than others, I could only find his outlook on life quite annoying. He regarded everyone as phony and I feel that in reality, he was just being very arrogant. Overall, if you are depressed and sad, read it. If not, you'll just hate it. "
1401,Rachelle,"This book was so boring, I had to force myself to finish it because I hate not finishing a book. I can't believe it is a classic."
1402,Ian Thomas Smith,"Worst piece of shit I have EVER read. Holden is, by far, one of the worst literary characters to have been written. He was not a deep thinker, he wasn't an intellectual, he wasn't a tortured artist or genius, he was a spoiled brat and a huge hypocrite. Why this book is considered good on any level is a huge surprise. It doesn't apply to today and was controversial in it's time due to it's profanity. I see it as insulting too, because it's an abomination to literature. "
1403,Leah Oliver,"The protagonist, the whiny and irritating Holden Caulfield possessed the least attractive personality of a fictional character that I have ever known. The plot seemed to have no sense of direction and was boring throughout. I was hoping for some miraculous climax but to my displeasure, one never came. The ending was abrupt and unclear and I was overjoyed to be finished reading this book (you know a book is a great work of literature if you do not want to finish it). I have come to the conclusion that you either love or hate this book. I presume that a lack of connection with and relation to the protagonist would lead someone to dislike this book. Overall, for me personally, a very disappointing read and a waste of time. "
1404,Spans,This book is terrible. I totally understand the book. just wasn't very interesting.
1405,Bushra,"One of those bestselling books, for which I don't understand their reason of being a bestseller! Didn't enjoy reading this! "
1406,Adallman,This is the third time I have started to read this book and it has failed to engage me. I dislike and have no empathy with the main character. Basically I feel he needs (a good slap) to question his motives and lifestyle. 
1407,Rachel Meyer,It wasn't for me. I plowed through even with all the language because of the critically acclaimed reviews through all these years. I can see what people like. But it's not for me :(
1408,Annabelle Lee-Adriano,Every kid goes through alienation at some point. But why the fuss over this one? I say it's an overrated book.
1409,Phil Matricardi,"this book is stupid, but some people seem to like it. maybe if the below paraphrase seems intriguing to you, you'll like it too.OMG, you mean that if i was crazy i would think i was sane? and it would seem like i was normal to me even though it would seem to other people like i was crazy??!?!?!?!?! I think i'm going to go crazy!!!! but how will i know oh noooooooooothis is my people hunting hat, bang, bang, how shocking, not."
1410,K S,"While it's an easy read and kept my attention, this book had absolutely no plot! It was poorly written as well. I thought it was one of the most pointless books I've ever read."
1411,Megdalynn,"Wow. That was it? What's all the hype about? I was mostly ambivalent about this book and had to force myself to get through it. I didn't look forward to picking it up at all. The swearing didn't even bother me, it totally went with the voice, but I just found it to be very boring."
1412,zazie,"Ok, what's wrong with me... le petit prince and this book - i just can`t understand what do people find in these two books... what' s that fuss all about? i remember reading it in high-school because we had to. i simply detested it. should i give it another chance?"
1413,Jeremiah,I don’t think teachers should make sophomores read Catcher in the Rye. There is too much for emotionally deficient teenagers. The book gives off this alone depressing feeling that sophomores shouldn’t have to experience in a school. Without a teacher to model the meaning of the situations and elaborate on the scene so the students don’t get that depressing feeling stuck to them. And also so the teachers can built background knowledge about the book. 
1414,Mehdi,"Allegedly one of the masterpieces of American Literature, ""the Catcher in the Rye"" was a huge disappointment in almost every way. While the novel may appeal to teenagers, its over-simplistic nihilism fails to convince adult readers. If Holden Caulfield is a rebel, he is a rebel without a cause: his systematic rejection of society lacks any theoretical underpinnings or moral justifications. The son of a wealthy New York corporate lawyer, the 16-year old is a spoiled brat who roams around New York wasting his savings on alcohol and women before returning to mommy and daddy once his stash runs out. The only bright part of the novel is the Holden-Phoebe relationship, a love that transcends nihilism. If you care for transgression, don't waste your time on Salinger - instead, read Sade or Bataille."
1415,Michael Fish,"This is my third attempt at reading The Catcher in the Rye. My first attempt was when I was 15 (I gave up and thanked god for CliffsNotes). Tried again in my 20's (I was told it would help me find my way through job hunting, it didn't). And now, I finally made it all the way through in my 30's and guess what... I hated Holden when I was 15 and I still hate him today.This is one of those ""Classics"" that made me hate ""Classics"" as a High Schooler. To put it into modern perspective, reading The Catcher in the Rye is like reading the Facebook posts of an annoying teenager. I understand that in the context of the time it was written the book was groundbreaking, but groundbreaking doesn't mean enjoyable or good. The book babbles aimlessly, and not in a good way like 'The Graduate'. Yes there are some insights about life hidden within, but those small insights are wrapped in so much useless complaining that the journey is just not worth it. Like Wells' ""The Invisible Man"", it is hard to appreciate a book when you are rooting for the protagonist to have something heavy dropped on them."
1416,Meghan,"I HATED THIS BOOK!!!! We had to read this during class, he just ruined it for me. He had to connect everything! Constantly, and I mean constantly asked ""Where do the ducks go in the winter?"" or right at the beginning he told us, oh he is speaking from a hospital. This book had no plot, and was very boring, just Holden complaining about his life and trying to hook up with older women. Not impressed at all by this classic."
1417,Sunny,"I read this some time in junior high, and I remember loathing the main character. It was the first time I ever wanted a character in a book to just shut up. Since I'm older now, it would probably be a good idea to read this again and see how my perspective might have changed but I doubt I'll bother. "
1418,|Lala| :),"i didnt really enjoy this book as much as i thought i would. i ws disappointed with some of the parts the characers had. For example, i thought JAne would have a bigger part in thid story but he only mentions her. He just speaks his mind [complains] all the time. The ending was alright but some chapters were boring while others were tense."
1419,Joanne Goon,"I recommend this book only to happy people because if you're already depressed before you crack it open, you're a goner. I read this book in high school and I remember thinking ""So this is why we have a need for extracurricular activities, retreats, prom..."" Every fun activity in high school is just a part of the recovery phase after having to read this book. It's incredibly dry and leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Kind of like rye bread. Hence, the title. In a nutshell, lots of people loved it, but personally it made me want to slit my wrists. "
1420,S Martin,"So happy I didn't have to read this at school growing up. Holden Caulfield is the perfect American hero. He's young, irresponsible, selfish and self-righteous. I hated him so much it was hard to finish the book at all. He's the perfect representation of the Peter Pan culture of young men who refuse to grow up and whine constantly while the world provides them more than they could ever need."
1421,Justin,"I have to admit, I didnt like this book. It's supposed to be a classic but following a angsty teen around while nothing happens isn't exactly what I want to do with my time. "
1422,Janna,"I DID NOT LIKE THIS BOOK. After I finished, I asked myself why I had just finished reading that garbage. It was not a book I would recommend. The language was filthy. The ending was disappointing. I was really stupid to have read this."
1423,Priyanka,"This goddamn book would've been <50 pages if Salinger kid hadn't horsed around so much! It really would've been! He has this protagonist & all.. old Holden Caulfield.. who is so snobbish & surrounded by all snobbish phonies, old sonuvabitch this old Holden Caulfield. The book didn't give me any Time. I want a book to give me The Time. I read a lot of books. I read Salinger kid because its classic & all. But boy! I say boy a lot of times. Old Holden gets on your nerves.. sonuvabitch. So he gets expelled & all helluva 4th time from a school. What I would have done if I was this Salinger kid, I wouldn't have cursed so much. Rather what I would've done is, I would've asked him what his problem was. Then he would've said he was frustrated with his life & wanted to write a book & all. Then you know what I would've done. I would've made him read his own goddamn book. Then he would've said this isn't my book. He would've thought I was gonna sock him. But I am very weak. Old Allie would've socked him. But I am weak. So I would've said this is your goddamn book, you wrote it Salinger kid!!I hate such corny words. This way the book goes on & on.. & doesn't give you any time. Save yourself. Please don't read this goddamn book!"
1424,Gerty,"I still hate this book, but at least this time I finished it."
1425,Mallorie Kuhl,"I know this is supposed to be a classic, but really it is a classic example of filth. There was no point to this story and the prolific language certainly didn't improve my opinion. "
1426,Malin,"Erin wrote: ""I didn't read this until I was an adult and there aren't words for how much I hate Holden Caulfield and his non-problem problems. Actually yes there are, and I use them in great volume whenever thi...""That makes me feel better. My colleagues in the English Dept, who decided that the smarter kiddies were to read this book were absolutely appalled when I said I hated the book. I just don't see how this book has any worth at all. Holden is a little shit. His life is not worth reading about. He has no character development over the course of the story - the whole book is as much a waste of time as Holden is a waste of space."
1427,Darren,"I didn't really enjoy this book when we had to read it at school as part of the Lit classes, but when I rediscovered it on my bookcase I thought I'd give it another go. Shouldn't have bothered really. 300 pages of whinging. Just get a grip, lad, and man up!"
1428,Zannie,"This book was awful - Holden Caulfield is a pretentious asshole, which I think is the point, but it doesn't mean I enjoyed it."
1429,Cristian,"I'm afraid I just didn't grok this book, nor understand why it appeals to so many people. While it's obvious that it's supposed to be more about Holden's thoughts and impressions (not much happens in the way of plot or drama), I personally find them to be trite, childish and not in the least bit inspiring. We've all been there, folks, we've all thought that it was only us that truly understood the world and held the moral upper ground, only to gradually realize how much more gorgeously sophisticated real life is. While I applaud Salinger's accuracy in depicting the profoundly flawed worldview of the average teenager, the book leaves me with little else in the way of emotion or learning."
1430,Kara Culmer,"I had high expectations for this booking based on the synopsis, however was highly disappointed. The book barely was able to hold my attention and I felt it lacked a plot. I became annoyed with the main character Holden who continued to mention in the book that he was not going to share all the details of his life and basically continued to share vivid details of what he was doing at a point in time. Overall, I would not recommend this book to anyone, as it left me thinking well what was that about. "
1431,Kayla Grace,"I only read this book, because everyone said it's such a ""classic"". I was so bored all the way through, but decided to finish it anyway. I assumed that it would get good at the end,and make all the torture of the first 20 chapters worth it. NO!It was terrible. I mean, it was an easy read...I read it in 2 days, but what a waste of time. It's VERY repetative...Also, I cannot believe that people read this in school. He gets a prostitute for goodness sake!! Every other word is gd. I am not a fan."
1432,rabbitprincess,"An okay story, although I don't know whether I really identified with Holden's angst, even though I was in the same age range. What really killed this book for me was the analysis we had to do in English class. I personally did not see it as being very rich or multi-layered...just a straightforward story about a teenager trying to figure out who he is and what his place is in the world. No need to cut it up into slices and stick it on a microscope slide."
1433,Pinky,"Am I the only person in America who doesn't really care for this book? Some parts are interesting, but on the whole I just wanted Holden to get the fuck over it and drop the angsty bullshit!"
1434,Shaun Dowse,"This is, without doubt or hesitation, the worst book I have ever read. If there is one positive, it is that this book only meanders on aimlessly for 228 pages and now I am free to read something that doesn't shoehorn the same half dozen phrases into seemingly every line."
1435,Evelyn,Re-read it for book club. Hated it the first time and don't know why I thought it would be different the second time around.
1436,Virginia Elliott,"I tried very hard to get through this book, because it is a classic. Made it about 2/3 of the way through and it just got too weird for me. Maybe sometime I'll try it again. . ."
1437,Annice22,"I read to page 75 before I stopped reading this. Wow, this was awful. Holden Caulfield is a whiny spoiled rich kid who does nothing but complain. Because for some reason the world has wronged him and everyone is a total phony or fake besides him. When he's the biggest one there is. Hard to believe this is a classic. The Catcher in the Rye is the only classic book that I did not finish reading. "
1438,Ida Keller,"1-1.5 stars. I did not like this book. I had to push myself to finish it. The main reason why i did not like this book was because of the protagonist. Holden Caulfield is one the most annoying, pretentious and whiny characters I have ever read about. He literally complains about everything and everyone.I just did not find this book appealing or interesting. "
1439,Kimberly,"hated every minute of this book. sorry for all you classics buffs, but too much cussing! children have tender ears..."
1440,Kelly Lindner,"I think J.D. has a way with words but not with content. This story is well written but seemingly pointless. I think it's only popular for the creative metaphor which gives it its name which is expanded on in the book. I think that could make it a good short story, but not a novel. The surrounding content just seems like meaningless dribble to me."
1441,Anna Schubert,"This book bored me and all. Maybe I wasn't in the mood, but I thought it was really phony, I really did. I would add some profanity to make this review all edgy like the book, but that would would make my review equally self-conscious and overrated, and I just can't do it."
1442,Allyson,"This book should have been named ""The Bitch and Moan""Seriously the main character needs a Happy Meal and for somebody to screw him immediately.When I was 13 and going through a hating-everybody-and-everything phase I would have loved this. If you're not in that phase though this book isn't for you."
1443,Hannah,Given to me by the same person as the Gormanghast novels. I despised this book so much after I was done with it I threw it away so that there would be one less copy someone might have to read. (It goes against everything I am to throw away a book)
1444,Kelsey S. Hock,"Ok guys. I was not able to finish this book. I got about 20 pages in and the protagonist's voice bothered me so much that even if there was a good story in there I couldn't get to it. Perhaps if you could relate to the character more you would enjoy it? I don't know, but it was definitely not for me."
1445,Virginia,"I know, I know... What kind of literary Philistine dislikes Catcher in the Rye? Maybe I read it too late in life. I found Holden to be whiny, self-absorbed, and basically repellent. Truly, I can't say that I so much disliked the book as that it left me unmoved. Whatever chord this book has struck with so many readers must be absent in me. "
1446,Kim,"I found this to be a very depressing negative book. I kept reading, hoping there might be even a little insight coming but it never happened. "
1447,Vania Melamed,"Hey, Holden, 'want some cheese with that whine? A bitter teenager (is there any other kind?)who'd be even more bitter to read about if it weren't for the rare humanity he shows for his little sister. I gave this book one star because that was the lowest option. J.D. Salinger is a princess who can't cope with reality so he lives in a cave and writes books about boys no girl would ever date. What's the big deal? The book has no academic merit. It's purely a moaning, miserable teenager who curses. Oh, wow! I can relate! I'm hooked on books for life, man! Seriously, what were our teachers thinking? And we killed trees to make this book."
1448,Kia,"I read this book 3 times; 7th grade, 11th & my 20's. In 7th I though the book was dull and Holden was surly. In 11th I thought it was terrible and badly written. In my 20's I wanted to bitchslap Holden.Did this book speak to me? Sure it said just because I'm a classic doesn't mean I'm any good. It also made me want to shake the snot out of Holden. I never felt moved by this book and I typically enjoy coming of age books. This was a waste of time. All 3 times. "
1449,Grace Cram,"This book had no point to it! There was no plot or story line, it was so boring!! I couldn't even keep all the information in this book straight! Throughout this whole book, I just wanted to take Holden and slap him and tell him to get a grip. Why is this considered a classic? It shouldn't even be considered a book!! "
1450,Jenniieed,"This book depresses me :( Gave it a chance but did not enjoy it at all. Only a depressed, pessimistic, sad person could relate to it."
1451,Monty Grubbs,I really think that this was a dumb book and i resent it. It was really stupid and i dont think that it pertains to life and any of its difficulties. The main character was a whiny brat who was really stupid and full of himself and was obsessed with sex and drinking.
1452,Lucinda,"Read way too late (at the age of 17) ... I was really annoyed by the main protagonist's constant whining and swear words. Didn't relate to him at all, didn't sympathise with his predicament, wasn't gripped either by the style and story-telling. I struggled to finish it. Maybe this novel which is supposed to embody a generation's expectations has aged in a bad way and seems old-fashioned nowadays..."
1453,M,*hated* this book. Why is it a classic? Why do they force teenagers to read this? Why is JD Salinger considered a brilliant author? I may never know.
1454,Barbara Lloyd,"Perhaps I was too old when I read it, but I honestly don't think I would ever have been the right age. "
1455,Ryan Dunlap,"This novel is a classic, and unfortunately for this reason many people will be subjected to read it for that reason. The word classic brings to mind a wonderful piece of literature with a deep story line, but truthfully this novel is the exact opposite. There are so many reasons why this novel is hard to read, but the main reason is because as a reader I felt like Holden Caulfield was a horrible person. Towards the end of the book I was so tired of him I honestly wanted him to die in order make things a little interesting. I didn't care how, I just wanted it to happen. Holden was the phony, just saying."
1456,Pao La,"I'm not american so maybe i don't really get the sense of this book for this reason.. or maybe because i'm not 16 any more. One thing i know for sure is that i would kick Holden Caulfield in the ass or at least shake him hard and tell him to stop wandering about. i know it's an important piece of american literature but maybe you can fully enjoy it only if you're 16 when you think your life is a mess, you hate your parents, the world is fucked up and you have no sense in life at all. 1 star is too much for this book, i've been very generous."
1457,Aviva,"I read Catcher for school and, although a lot of people have disagreed with me, thought it was awful. I never warmed up to Salinger's writing style, and couldn't really stand Holden as a character."
1458,Janet,"this is not a book for 60 year olds! I may have enjoyed it when I was younger but I did not care for it now. I'm sure in 1951 it was controversial, but it just didn't speak to me now, in 2013. Oh well, glad that I have finally read it. "
1459,Kerri Lynn,"UGHHH this book is so annoying. The way people talk it up, its classified as a classic, and perhaps it is, but Holden is SO whiny and annoying. I forced myself to finish it, but it was a struggle. I sincerely do not like this book."
1460,Johnk,"I was 12 when I read this book. It was poorly translated version by a group of college students. They were later got caught and sentenced for 10 years in prison for distributing and promoting communist propaganda and corrupting young minds. My felling was well.... damn, at least few grown ups do understand how I feel about things. Kuso! No wonder government wants it banned in the name of national security.30 years later, I read it again. My thought is... damn kids, these days. They think they are entitled for everything. Don't get me wrong. I have three children of my own and I love them dearly. They are not at age of Caulfield, but I'll love'em just the same when/if they turn out to be just like Caulfield. Yet, I pray they don't. When I read Catcher in the Rye for the first time, all I could see and think of was Caulfield. I wanted to be just like Caulfield. Hell. Why wait 'till 16. Screw that Algebra test. I'm gonna walk right into pachinko parlor, win some money, spend a night at manhwa store, eat lots of croquttes and Ramen, and I'm gonna take a peek at that pretty high school girl's underwear who works there. This could be awesome! Well. Plan didn't work out. I got pushed over by high school gang on the way to Pachinko, lost all my money, got black eye, and cried home to my mama. Well. I should have waited 'till 16.Anyway, when I read for the second time, all I could think of was ""Who are you Mr. Salinger?"" I read somewhere that book is a window to a writer's mind. If this is true, then whom I see is a man with a low self esteem who can't quite overcome the hurdles of life.I can(sort of) understand why book is listed in Time’s List of 100 Best Fiction of the 20th Century. It's a rare to find a book that is loved by teens(Holden is a defender of a childhood), but hated by parents(Holden is a smart ass, self-righteousness, good for nothing lazy bum who needs a good spanking, job, or both. Please keep my daughter safe from a boy like Holden.) "
1461,J.T. Zakrzewski,"This was one of the most unenjoyable books I've ever read. I guess I never went through a period of my life where I felt like Holden, and I found him to be nothing more than a cynical, self-destructive kid. I understand that many go through this, but there was little to no character growth, and it was simply a tough 200 pages to get through."
1462,Gabriella,"E' stato terribile leggere questo libro: Ogni mezza frase compare "" e cose cosi"", vattellapesca. La cosa peggiore è stato leggere: ""era un quacchero e cose così""!!! cosa???? se uno è quacchero è quacchero! mi faceva saltare i nervi! Sarà pure un romanzo di formazione, ma mette a dura prova la tua pazienza."
1463,Gabrielle,I'll wait until Emma writes her review...
1464,Carlos  Ochoa,"""The Catcher in the Rye"" is a book about how Holden(main character)goes through alot of situation in life. The main idea of the book is ""life"". Holden is represented as an example of failure in life, because he does not care about anything that goes around his life. Is a good book because some people might connect themselves in some situation Holden went through during the book."
1465,Florencia,"I didn't really understand the book - I found myself quite bored while reading it. I really had to push myself to actually finish it - a real shame, after hearing so much about this book I was really excited to read it! But I just ended up feeling let down - maybe I missed something ..."
1466,Aymeezus,"I know this is one of those well known kind of books. All around me, people talk of it. So of course, my expectations were pretty high when I started reading this. I did NOT understand any of it. I would read the words but I simply cannot understand what's Holden going at. I looked into the book more (the author, the reviews, etc..) and I find that most teenagers would relate to this. As a teenager myself, I am in disbelief that I cannot relate to this. This book is the definition of a teenager and I somehow do not fit that description. From this, I percieve that this book is aimed at a very select/specific group of teenagers. I couldn't say I was pleased with the small range if vocabulary (corny, phony, etc..) I understand it's use as to fit Holden's image but after seeing it a few more times, I get tired of it. Overall, I'd say Yhe Catcher in the Rye requires a lot of thinking."
1467,Lola,"I read this book hoping for something really good, based in all the buzz around itAfter reading about 52 pages I had to stop and make a little reserach, since I started feeling that the story was not going anywhere. I found that this book was supossed to reflect the conflict of teenagers and was a big boom on its time, because it spoke of things not that common then, I guess.But even knowing that, I didn´t saw in the story the escence of teens what I really found in this book was a story about a stupid and disturbed kid, that thinks that he is the only worthy person in the world,that´s trying to play grownup, a pretty disturbed one, by the way. The literaly style horrible as well as the story and the main character.Anyway I kept on reading till the end, just to find out it don´t get any better. I ended feeling tired of this kid and his stupid behaviour and very sorry for all those who sees him as an icon of youth."
1468,Kate Jongbloed,"Think I'm the only person in the world never to really like this book. I've read it about three times, and still nothing."
1469,Niall519,Another one I was forced to suffer through at school.The best thing about it is that it's heavily referenced in the anime series 'Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex'.
1470,Donna Madsen,Terrible book. I would never read it again.
1471,Karly,"When I first picked up this book the thing that intrigued me most was the absence of a blurb or summary of the book on the cover (back, front or inside likewise). Therefore, other than my understanding that the book is considered a contemporary classic, I went into this book 100% blind.The first thing I noticed was the way in which language is used in the novel. Holden Caulfield tends to repeat exactly what he says multiple times on every page. This drove me insane. From a literary perspective, I can see the effect of this, when teemed with the fact that the use of slang in the book reflected the way in which it is used in reality, as it creates a conversational flow to the story telling method of the character. This develops a more intimate relationship between the reader and character thence. However, acknowledging and accepting this, it still drove me insane. By three-quarters of the way through the book, I wanted to scream at Holden. Which brings me to my next point...I don't think I have ever read about a more depressing or sad character as Caulfield. His utmost pessimistic outlook on everything in life has made me devout to not consider things so daftly in my own life. I'm not sure if this is actually the intention of the book, or whether or not this is just the conclusion that my own interpretation has led to but either way, it is what I gained most from reading this story. And truthfully, I was questioning what message this novel was trying to convey at first and it wasn't until the last 30-40 pages that I found my answers.Holden Caulfield is unequivocally the most flawed character I have ever read, which subsequently, also makes him the most unique. Although I disliked this, as to me he had no redeemable qualities, I have a great appreciation for the length of dedication J.D. Salinger went through to achieve this and what it means as a statement in literature. Because to be honest, if I was to ever successfully write my own book, I don't think I could ever write a character so devoid of any likeable qualities.All up, it was an interesting story to read. It frustrated the hell out of me more often than not but I persevered and although I didn't necessarily enjoy the book, I can semi appreciate what I got from reading it."
1472,Elsha,"I lack the gene that helps me understand why this book is a classic. Or, maybe I'm just too far removed from my high school/college English classes that encourage me to be a bit more analytical when I read. Nevertheless, I had a hard time getting past the language and just was not impressed. "
1473,Lilly,I honestly didn't like this classic all that much. At least part of that reasoning is probably that it's a classic. I also disliked that it was only about a boy who suffered from depression and couldn't really get the help he needed. I thought he was kind of annoying and childish and what he had to say did not interest me all that much. 
1474,JC,"Bleh...I was glad to be done reading this book. Holden just couldn't get enough talking in this book and he was all over the place. He couldn't keep his mind on one thing and we went off on pointless tangents that had nothing to do with anything. Plus he swears every 10 words or so but then when he sees ""Fuck You"" written he can't stand it?? Doesn't make much sense to me at all. I reread this book because I had read it in high school and didn't remember anything from it. I would not recommend it again to anyone unless you are looking for a read that is going nowhere except all over the place."
1475,Kathy,"I was surprised by the ending, but overall disappointed... so what? Anyone can chronicle events in their lives - why did this one teenager's observations on humanity make the cut of ""literature""?"
1476,Vidya,"I guess i am in a minority..i literally laboured through the whole book!!!!Honestly i picked up the book only because it is considered a classic but mebbe my expectations were too high ....or just that i did not relate to the character at all......i mean,he just meanders through life...i really dont want to judge that(coz that is exactly what i am doing!) but doesn't seem to enjoy it anyways!!!i mean..just get on with it !!!!he is neither here not there..is randomly confused which again is ok for a 16 yr old...but i just cant stand such total self absorption!!!!so there."
1477,Dawnbg,"I so wanted to like this book. Maybe if I'd read it at 16 I would have liked it, but then again, I was never a self-absorbed, psychotic 16 year old boy."
1478,Ting Tong,'The Catcher in the Rye' has been one of those titles that I've always wanted to read because it always seems to be talked about. I had this impression that it is was an older book and so was more of a classics genre; how wrong could I be. It's a contemporary Americanised story written in the voice of the protagonist who appears to be a bit of an idiot. Perhaps it is because of the time that it is written in but I couldn't connect with the characters or find them believable in any way. Nothing much happens in terms of plot and I was left feeling like I wish I hadn't bothered reading it. 
1479,Jo,"I have heard so much about this book, I just wanted to read it. Now that I have, I can honestly say...I don't get it. Holden needs to grow up. Maybe if I had read this as an adolescent it would have meant more to me. As an adult, all I can say is GROW UP!"
1480,Reed,There is an inverse relationshiop between popular opinion and my opinion regarding this extremely overrated description of spoiled adolescence. Give me a break.
1481,Crystal Sams,"I think, had I read this book as a teenager, I may have enjoyed it. As it is, I think that Holden just served to show, in a timeless way, what nasty little buggars teenagers are. It was easy to imagine this in a current setting rather than 60-70 years ago. The writing had a nice flow to it, very easy to read. But this was a book that I just couldn't seem to like. This may be in part due to the fact that I read ""Looking for Alaska"" at the same time. The books were very similar, but because I liked the other so much, I think that may have made me like this one that much less. I am almost ashamed to admit that it took me just about 3 weeks to read this barely 200 page book. But I suppose that's just a testament to how bad I thought it was."
1482,Libby,"I wish I could give this no stars. This is probably the dullest book I've ever read and if I hadn't been forced to read it at school I would've thrown the bloody thing out the window after the first three pages. Never have I encountered a plot so boring. I could see it nearly getting to the point where Holden just wrote ""Breathed in...then breathed out again.""The plot has no point, no climax, no events...nothing of any interest at all. The character annoyed me from the start. He is whiny and irritating. I wanted to grab him by the shoulders and tell him to pull himself together. This was basically an entire book filled with whining from a hormonal teenager. Perhaps more frustrating than the plots lack of...well anything was the fact that at the end of every sentence Holden would say ""and all."" WHY?! It got to the point where I was flinching every time he said it. ""Goddamn"" and ""phony"" also cropped up far too much to be tolerable. Am I missing something here? The fact that this is called a ""classic"" seems laughable to me and I seriously wonder whether my copy of the book had a huge chunk missing. All in all I pretty much hated this and it's not often I say that about a book. I'm just glad I read it at school and didn't have to waste my money on such drivel. "
1483,Nick Sologoub,"I am surprised with myself, that I was able to find strength to finish that book after all. I guess I was hoping that maybe somewhere there it is going to get better. But no... I was wrong. This book is total and complete rubbish and I regret every second I have spent reading it.Maybe if I was fifteen years old I may have liked it, I would guess this totally childish style of writing may appeal to a younger audience. But for a grown-up and intelligent being this is an insult to eyes and brain. I really don't understand who would like a book about some fucked up and miserable teenager whose vocabulary is no more then a thousand words big."
1484,Michelle,Everybody says this is such a great book but i couldn`t really find anything about it that I liked very much....Interesting to read but really not my cup of tea
1485,Niahames,"I don't understand the cult following this book has. I don't say it about many books, but I feel as thought it was a waste of my time, given though, that it was a really easy read. I get that everyone can ""relate"" to Holden, but it still doesn't merit half the praise it seems to have."
1486,Kimborah,I read this because I had heard so much about it...I hated it. The author uses the GD word constantly throughout the whole story.
1487,Crystal,I didn't like it at all. I haven't read it since high school when everyone who read it said it was the greatest thing that they'd ever read - even those who weren't forced to read it for an assignment - but I just couldn't get worked up about the main character and his problems.
1488,Mark Ueber,"Cover-to-cover whining. I understand what Salinger was trying to do, but I never developed any empathy for Holden. If he was a real person, I would have grabbed him by the lapels and said, ""Grow up you coward."""
1489,Nic Combs,"I hated this book. It was pointless, and had no point to me. Yeah it was about a boy finding himself in the ideas that everyone else has influenced him. I don't see how this is a classic, I hate it when we read books like this. They make me feel depressed and there is no need to read them."
1490,Janice,"I know it is considered great literature, but it was torture when I was forced to read it in high school, and I love to read - couldn't wait to get my summer reading books each year. This is the only book I remember with extreme venom when I see the title. People tell me I should try it as an adult reader, but I can't."
1491,C.H. Armstrong,"The only way I can describe this book is to say that it feels like the ramblings of a depressed and mentally ill teenage boy. And, with that in mind, I'm trying to understand what the allure for this book is. Why is it required reading in so many schools when there are so many better choices out there? With this book on many required reading lists, its no wonder so many kids hate to read. There was simply no point to this book.While this was an easy read, it wasn't one that I'd call a page-turner by any stretch of the imagination.The main character, Holden Caulfield, is a fairly typical teenage boy except to say that he's lazier and more negative than any teenage boy I've ever known. He has no real goals for the future, and I think the author pretty much captured that with his writing style. There was no build-up or anticipation for any great thing to happen. It was more a narrative of his day-to-day doings when he decides to leave school earlier than the release date.I often wondered if this kid suffered with what we now recognize as a Aspergers, a high-functioning form of autism. Basically, he had few social skills and completely missed social cues. More than that, even, he'd become fixated on a particular topic and would ramble in endless paragraphs about that particular topic. And, just when you thought he'd gotten over his obsession with a particular topic, he'd revisit it in a later chapter.Overall, I didn't care for this book. The only really good thing about this book is that it was a quick read."
1492,Kristy K,"I could not finish this novel. I tried, especially since I've consistently heard about it since high school, but after reading struggling through over 100 pages, I couldn't get myself to read the second half. It's heralded as this great ""coming of age"" novel, yet all I read was the unreliable ramblings of a teenage boy during his last night at school and throughout New York before heading home. This book was definitely not for me."
1493,Gareth_C Gareth_C,"How you react to this book is all about how your expectations are set going in. If you are expecting a classic masterpiece in the vein of many other classic masterpieces, you may well be disappointed, as I was. It's dull, repetitive in langauge and form which transpires into a slog of a read. Would this be published today? Would the literati extol its virtues now? Probably not..."
1494,Nivedita Bansal,"The book focuses on the feelings, confusions and struggle of a teenager and is widely accepted as a classic but I din't find anything so great about this book. I don't think I would have liked it even as a teenager because not only the story line but I disliked the narration style as well. It was a bit too descriptive and language was repetitive which only led to boredom after a few pages. A disappointing and unimpressive read."
1495,J.,"One of the most pretentious and overrated novels I have ever read. The main character is a kid who thinks he is some kind of philosopher and a 'misunderstood' genius. He walks around New York City lamenting his ""privileged white kid"" station in life while sneaking back in to his parents' Park Avenue apartment. Overall I thought this read was pointless. It did not tell me anything new, and at the same time was annoying and conceited. "
1496,Kattie,"So shoot me, I did not like this book. I appreciate classics, don't get me wrong, but I wanted to hit the main character."
1497,Emme,"Holden Caulfield was a hipster - and I hate hipsters.(By the way I read this when I was 17 and I didn't relate to it, even then. Probably because I wasn't a trust fund waspy-type teen.)"
1498,Daniel Adorno,"I wanted to refrain from writing negative reviews of books, but I cannot help myself when it comes J.D. Salinger's ""classic."" The story is a mess and the main character is about as unappealing as they come. Maybe I need to read it again since it's been a few years and I can appreciate eccentric writing more, but my memory recalls a plot surrounding a whiny kid who meets up with a prostitute and dreams of catching bread in a rye field. On second thought, one read is enough."
1499,Adrienne,"One of the most overrated books ever in my opinion. I've had multiple discussions on why I am wrong, but for me, I am not. Maybe I'm just a phoney, and a girl."
1500,Katherine Martin,"This was one of those books that I could not get into. By the sixth chapter I actually found myself getting annoyed with it completely. The way it's written, you either connect with the main character Holden and love it, or you don't and you hate it.As far as I could tell, there was no character development and no point to it. The whole thing just kept rambling on. On top of that, there was excessive language that completely distracted from the lack of story. Overall, not a good book and I don't understand why it has been labelled a classic."
1501,Shira,"I did not like this book. I found it crude, with little direction. The language, while attempting to sound like a teenager, often just sounded like bad writing. The ending was hardly an ending at all. I did love the brother-sister relationship though."
1502,Hayley B,You either identify with Caulfield or you just wish he'd stop whining and man up; I'm in the latter camp. I didn't enjoy it and didn't finish it.
1503,Cheyenne,"If I could give this book a zero, I would. I absolutely hated it. Generally, I don't hate books, either. Usually it's a very strong dislike, and generally, I give them a second chance. But no, I will never be reading this book again.In my opinion, Holden is the worst character in the English language. Salinger tried just too damn hard to make him 'universal', to the point where he becomes unrealistic. His train of thought is annoying and repetitive, and God, those catchphrases of his. Can someone shut this kid up? Holden is almost the anti-Gary Stu. Nearly every thing's wrong with him. The one good thing about him being his love for his younger sister. The plot is one of the worst I've ever read. It's boring, and it, like Holden, is unbelievably and painfully repetitive. Holden calls up an old friend, has a drink. Holden calls up a girl, has a drink. Holden dances with a girl. Then he drinks. Was there a climax to this book? I must have missed it. Maybe it was Holden nearly freezing to death (um, what?) in Central Park? No, no, maybe it was when Holden called up that hooker! Maybe not. The plot is so fuzzy and flat I couldn't tell when to peak my interest.And that's just it, it never did.So buh-bye, Holden! Your book's been gathering dust on my shelf for the past two years and it'll stay that way. Until I decide to sell it, of course."
1504,Jaime O'laughlin,If I want to read a relatable coming of age tlale full of harsh judgements passed on others paired with self loathing I will read my own writings from my teenage years. Phony bastard.
1505,Stephanie Malvica,"This book was the worst book I ever picked up in my entire life. I know everyone has their own opinions and I respect that, but this story did nothing for me. As a female, I could not relate to this at all. The whole book all he does is bitch and complain. It was so dull. Just a bunch of rambling from the main character. "
1506,Nicholas,"I'd heard about this book for YEARS, and I finally got around to reading it just after high school. What a let down. I cannot figure out why this character is so highly revered. If you want to read an adolescent bitching, whining and complaining about everything, read on, but I can't see the greatness of it. I'm not saying that Mr. Salinger doesn't have writing talents, he most certainly spoke in his characters voice exceedingly well, but the story line did nothing for me. Different strokes...I guess."
1507,Cajuntagious,"aka the most boring book ever written. I'd rather be punished into reading Twilight as required reading then this ""American Classic"" ever again. The only good part was when the pimp beat up the main character because he's such an extremely unlikable self-centered whiny douchebag you just want to see he him suffer the moment you're introduced to him. No real point in the book either, the main guy just wanders aimlessly the whole novel feeling sorry for himself depressed and then it just ends."
1508,Lorelle,"When I first looked at this book I thought that I was going to love it, I thought that I would really be able to connect to it. Then I opened it and realized that I was very wrong. The book had some positive elements to it like he had some good outlooks on life. Such as when he says “Don’t ever tell anybody anything. If you do, you’ll start missing everybody”. I can see why teachers might want to teach this to high school students, the main character is about our age and is struggling with some of the same stuff as us. For example he talks about his times at Pencey Prep and how he got kicked out and why. He has somewhat of a hard time getting along with his roommate. After he leaves Pencey he goes around town and buys things for himself, talks to strangers, and is very independent. I think that is something a lot of high schoolers are looking to have. The things that I didn’t like about the book are how he repeats himself throughout the entire book. For example when he talks, at the end of each sentence he says “and all”. Some negative things in the book is that the book is very outdated, it’s over 60 years old and the language is very old fashioned. Personally I found it harder to connect to because it was about a boy who goes to boarding school, maybe if it were taught in just boarding schools it would work better.If you don't mind reading a book that doesn’t really come to an end, then I would say this book is for you."
1509,Kaden,"Here is a review I wrote last year in response to Catcher in the Rye. I read Catcher when I was a sophomore in high school. --""HURR DURR DUCKS, HURR DURR CAROUSEL, NUUURRRRRR HOOKERS, FFFFFFFFFFF MY LITTLE SISTER, NUUUUURRRRRRRRRRR DUCKS AGAIN.""- a general summary of the events in the book, as told by Holden. Holden spends the entire book complaining, having half-assed thoughts about half-assed things, and doesn't get a single thing accomplished in the entire book. It is a pointless story about a whiny little kid who's ever obsessed with ducks and doesn't have any kind of backbone to have sex with a prostitute. Instead, he wants to sit there and talk to her just like he sits there and talks to us about all of his pointless thoughts. Any time I think about how an utterly useless book is one of the most well-praised literary achievements to date, I want to tear my hair out. Holden is no better than any whiny little emo kid, or any other stereotype that gets so much crap - in fact, he's the equivalent OF a whiny little emo kid for that day and age. He spends the entire book going, ""HURR I think I'll think this way about things!"" and then two pages later decides ""nope I'm too much of a wuss. Damn. I'm going to sit here and feel sorry for myself and make you read it.""The thing that really drives me bananas is that the premise is something that I SHOULD enjoy. It's contemplative fiction where the main character spends the majority of the time debating morals, sorting through his feelings about the world, and waxing philosophical. Only, because of the poor execution, I find myself forced to loathe it. It never goes anywhere or becomes anything, we never even reach a pinnacle of character enlightenment after spending the entire time listening to Holden's confused thought processes and immense self loathing.Other books have executed an example of what Salinger attempts much better than Catcher ends up being. One example of this is The Perks of Being a Wallflower, which is similar contemplative fiction but includes nifty things like a plot, characters who develop as you read with evolving perspectives, insights, and symbolism that counts. Perks is the book that Catcher could have been if JD Salinger had spent any of his time formulating an actual plot. It's just a book about some kid who wants to see some ducks and think about carousels, and as much as anyone tells me that it's the symbolism that drives the book and makes it what it is, symbolism only counts if you reach a conclusion at the end of the day. Symbolism only counts if what you've put forward has made a lasting impact and point. I'm irritated because this book seeks to be profound and I've found that most people like to think it is profound when it's utterly nothing. There is no useful symbolism anywhere in the entire thing. There is no plot, not even a minimal one. I hate it. I hate JD Salinger. And no matter how many times I've attempted to revisit it, my opinion has never changed. It drives me crazy and I can't understand why it has such high praise. "
1510,Peggy,"So this is just a fancy name for ""Catcher in the Rye."" I read it in French because I got it for .50 at the DI. I hated it! Maybe I need to read it in English, I don't know. Am I the only person in the entire world who didn't like it? It just seemed depressing to me. I don't like depressing books. I'm an optimist."
1511,Terry,"Not trying to be different, I just don't get it. It was banned from my highschool reading list, so I thought I should go back and see what all the fuss was about... Still don't get it... Oh well"
1512,Hannah Earlywine,"I really didn't like this book what so ever. I thought Holden was a complete self centered jerk. I didn't see the point of this book. All it was, was Holden going on and on about all his ""problems"" and how he doesn't like anyone. Maybe if he hadn't have been such a hypocrite than I would have liked it a little better."
1513,Shauntal Bradley,I hated this book. He is a spoiled little rich kid who thinks his life is so hard. Couldn't even force myself through half of it. 
1514,Karen Jules,"damn, I hated this book."
1515,Scribble Orca,74000 words to express what could have been better done in about 7400.And even that's being generous.
1516,Dani,"I think this is the worse book that has ever been labeled a ""clasic"". Ever!I this book because I am an avid reader, however, I never read the book I should. I refuse to read the Harry potter book, I simply couldn't finish perks of being a wallflower, an Jane Austin just flat out bores me. All this makes me feel bad, because boom that most other reader like, I hate. I only truly like old classic; i tend to hate modern classic, hoping like this one, I decide give it a try.Truth was, it was terrible! The book offend, angry, and straight bored me! The writer is as flat is the paper it is printing on, and the character are just about as alive as unicorns.  Holden, the main character, is root of the problems. sure,he an anti-hero, but I don't think the author got what that was. Holden is all anti, but no hero. He so hatable, because he hate everyone. Everyone, ( and ever word) is phony or fake. Plus, Holden is a bigot, especially to wome, and homosexuals. He has very little respect for girl, and most on the girl I book are portrayed as dumb, and just a sex toys, one the line book, that found most offense was this : ""Ithink I really like it best when you can kid the pants off a girl when the opportunity arises, but it's a funny thing."". How could book, with a line like that, every be consider a classic, let alone be assign to middle or high schoolers to read? And the cursing- How could been published- in 1951!!!!!!!!!!I admit,the book has a great premise, the main character, Holden, basically takes over the book and make it miserable. Holden hate everyone, and the only emotion he seem to feel is loneliness and depression. He see, only care about 3 or 4 people the whole book. ( he only like Jane, Sally, His kid sister Phoebe, a 2 Radom nuns) he tend to ramble, and rarely can stay on topic,and but, when coming to changing settings, he basically teleport ever where. Bottom line, I would not recommend to a friend- not unless I was angry at them "
1517,Effy Weasley," 'people are always ruining things for you.'i really don't understand the popularity of this book. it's badly written, the main character uses the phrase 'and all' in every other sentence, in every third sentence he is 'horsing around' and in every fourth sentence he complains how nobody understands him and how he is so much more intelligent than everyone else. also, everyone and everything is 'phony' but himself. nothing really happens, you just follow this mopy, whiny, mentally sick teenager for a couple of days through manhattan in the 1950ies. that's it. of course the topic of teeange angst and the conviction that you're the only one who knows what's going on is important and may have been interesting if the character of holden caulfield would be a bit more likeable but i seriously hated this guy's guts. in my opinion it's a waste of time - although it might be that i don't get the book because i didn't grew up in the american culture and i didn't read it as a teenager. "
1518,Leona," On completion of reading this book I found myself wondering, ""Wait...is that it? Is that how it all ends? Did someone switch the REAL content of 'The Catcher in the Rye' and replace it with a 13 year-old's badly written English essay?!""  Alas, the pages presented before my eyes was, in fact, the REAL story of 'The Catcher in the Rye.' I can not begin to comprehend why this book has such an illustrious stature in the world of reading.  With ill designed characters, presenting little or no depth, continuous plot-holes and an overall monotonous story line, this book barely deserves a 1-star rating.  The protagonist of this story, Holden Caufield, is possibly the most aggravating character you will ever come across. His extremely cynical narration throughout is nothing but unpleasing and distasteful. His over-use of the words: ""phony"" and ""corny"", to describe nearly anything and everything just ends up being irritating and not at all influential, which some people may have you believe - Holden's views on society, that is.  An English teacher of mine once claimed that 'The Catcher in the Rye' is,""a novel you either love or hate"", and I agree with the sentiment, even though I can not grasp how anyone can ""love"" this book.  Yet I feel as though the main reason for this book's level of excellence in the reading world was because of the period it was written; the fifties. Despite causing major controversy over the use of its profanity and sexual content throughout, and of course the scene where Holden swears at a female adolescent-quite a scandal in it's day, no doubt- I truly believe that if this book were to be published today, in 2015, it would merely be your average bland book slouched on a shelf in the ""Young Adult"" section in the book shop, rather than the ""Classic"" section.

1519,Karl Goodwin,Can I have the time I wasted on this book back please. I don't understand why this is a 'classic' nor do I really care.
1520,Dana,للاسف لم استطع ان اكملها لعدة اسباب اهمها النظرة السوداوية التي كانت تسود الرواية حتى اني شعرت ان الاسم لا يمت لموضوع الرواية بصلة .. الرواية كانت عبارة عن سرد تفتقر للغة الادبية فقد كانت محشوة بالالفاظ النابية
1521,Jason,I read this book in college because one of my professors spoke about how it changed the course of his life. I have never enjoyed a book less.
1522,Aurora  Fitzrovia,"Auf Seite 80 abgebrochen.""The Catcher in the Rye"" stand lange auf meiner Wunschliste und danach lange ungelesen in meinem Regal. Und vielleicht war es da auch besser aufgehoben ._.Mich langweilt die Geschichte, mich nerven die Gespräche und vor allem nervt mich der Protagonist, Holden Caulfield. Was für ein furchtbar blöder Kerl! Diese ständige Nörgelei und Lügerei und was Holden über seine Mitmenschen denkt, ist mir zuwider und ich denke nicht, dass ich mich auf den verbleibenden 110 Seiten noch mit Holden anfreunden würde. Außerdem stört mich die Sprache. Ja, vielleicht mag es jugendlich klingen, aber für mich ist Holdens Ausdrucksweise einfach too much.Neee, neee. Einfach nicht meins.(so und nu suche ich mir ein hoffentlich besseres Buch aus)"
1523,Laurie Pellegrini ziegler,I don't understand what all the hype is about this book. I hated it! I had to force myself to finish it.
1524,Steve,"Various friends have postulated that you have to read this book before you reach a certain age/maturity. I think I missed that cut-off, because I couldn't see much worth in this novel. Perhaps it was more revolutionary in its time. I found it boring."
1525,Michellelukes123,"I didn't pay attention in High School when we read this and decided to crack it open recently. I didn't care much for it, even if it is a classic and even if I was an English major. Maybe in high school I might have enjoyed it because it is about a pissed off teenager who thinks everyone is lame and or a jerk, feelings that I could have related to back then. Also, it has some ""adult"" content such as prostitution, sex, and the ""f-word"", all of which generally are not found in required high school reading, which probably would have seemed inviting to me. While it explored themes that I could relate to such as feelings of alienation and loneliness, I think it could have been represented just the same in 10 pages. I say read it but with out any expectations."
1526,Todd,Another classic I was looking forward to but was ended up feeling cheated. I don't get the hooplah about this book.
1527,Wandering Annabelle,"So I basically reading this boy complaining about every single thing in his life. What!!? I felt so so disappointed, extremely disappointed. This might be rude but, ""what the fuck am I reading?"".It's totally NOTHING. Just a book that complain about everything. I don't get the point, actually. I may not have encapsulates enough so only generous one star for this book. "
1528,Priscilla,"""The Catcher in the Rye"" by J.D. Salinger is about a troubled teen named Harold Claufield. He is not a really good student. His family is really wealthy so he could go to any school he wants to even if he fails. The book was written as Harold taalking to a sycoanalysist. He talks about how a lot of people are ""phonies"". He beleives everybody is a phonie. Only a few people he beleives are authentic. Like his sister Pheobe. Harold is also really depressed, he must grow up, and I believe he was starting to realize that. I don't beleive he was ready to grow up. During this story, Harold fails most of his classes and is kicked out out of another school. He goes to New york and kind of wanders around there. He is eginning to see clearly what is happening. Why he feels like this. At the end, he visits his sister Pheobe, and he lets his emotions out. He cries and cries. He begins to have a break through. He begins to change who he really is. He lets it out, and starts over. Holden Claufield is changing for the better. He is becoming a grown man. Now he realizes he must take responsibilty and grow up. "
1529,Sharlene Harsh,"Yes I read it, yes I skimmed through a lot of it. And reconstructed sentences because of the language in the book. The humor at first caught my attention. I had put it on my list because it's a ""classic"". Cannot recommend it, and it has been returned to the library. "
1530,Roadkill1313,Perhaps the most over-rated book of the 20th century. This piece of drivel has turned countless generations away from the pleasures of reading after having it crammed down their throats by English teachers who think it the greatest thing ever put on paper. The book itself is ample proof of why Salinger never had another successful novel.
1531,Yulia Shvets,Maybe I was in the wrong mood but I definitely didn't like this book. 
1532,Lauren Kimberly,"I read this book for school and I will never understand why this book was published. This book was okay at best. This is one of those books that has a lesson at the end of it, but really this book is a little pointless. First of all the main character is so incredibly weird that its hard to even describe! The ""problems"" in this book are such little problems that they hardly even seem like problem! Other than the little insignificant lesson at the end of the book, the story was otherwise very pointless. Usually stories have problems that occur, but the ""problems"" in this book didn't even seems like problems. Because of that I think that this story doesn't really have a plot structure! Every time that the main character rambled on and on I wanted to throw the book against the wall! There is nobody more annoying than this main character! No one! DO NOT READ THIS BOOK! "
1533,Mariana,"Privileged teenage boy complains about things but it is deep, you know, because he might have mental issues. Supposed to be about this universal coming of age experience of puberty but completely unrelatable to everyone except white rich teenage boys. Overrated, clearly doesn't age well."
1534,Margaret,This is the longest rant of teenage angst! I think I would rather read the more poorly written _The Bell Jar_ than this!
1535,Amanda,"This is one of the only books that I just cannot tolerate-- (Wuthering Heights and the Great Gatsby being the others). I recently tried to reread this with a better literary perspective than I had in high school, but I am still failing to see the greatness of Holden Caufield. I really did try to give this a fair chance, what am I missing? "
1536,Estela,"Aside from cutting classes, thinking that everything is boring, getting ax at schools, I also learned a lot of slang words and curses from this book. No kidding. I'm not hating, I'm not a good student or a good kid either. It's just that he is not realizing that whatever he does his parents still continues to support him which is a bit unreal. Or maybe, his parents are filthy rich that they don't care about money anymore and they don't care about their kid even more. I got nothing learned from this book so I'm rating it a single star."
1537,Caitlin,"Seriously overrated. Holden Caulfield is one of the most beloved protagonists in American literature, but he is so obnoxious to me, I imagined myself continually punching him in the face while trudging through this book.If you love to hear angsty teenagers whine about their lives, this just might be your new favorite novel!"
1538,Stephcia,"I could see where people think it's good, but of my opinion those people are looking too much into it. This is one of those books 'Hipsters' would call their favorite book. I'm being a hater, I know, I just don't think this book is as genius as people say"
1539,Ashlyn,"No no no. I'm sorry, I know that tons of people think this book is amazing and wonderful and has some intrinsic insight into the plight of the American teen/twenty-something, but honestly.He wanders around New York for three days, bitching and moaning, and DOING NOTHING. He condemns hypocrites, though he is a hypocrite himself. I guess there's probably some interesting point about human nature there, but I DIDN'T CARE. The guy gets beat up by a pimp, for heaven's sake, and it's not even an interesting scene!Oi. I just really don't like this book. And I honestly gave Salinger another try too, with 'Franny and Zoey.' Nope, that one lost my interest too. Oh well."
1540,Cara,"I'm not sure I've ever disliked a character as much as I dislike Holden. His character just annoys me - to the point that every time he called something phony, I wanted to hit him in the head with a shovel. The book on the whole was disappointing in several ways, and I did not connect to the story or the characters in a way that I was particularly satisfied with. In some ways, I can see why this book is considered a ""classic"", but at the same time, my general opinion was that Catcher was a book about a whiny kid who needed to get a life."
1541,Katie P,"I couldn't make it through this book. Unless something amazing happens in the last 20 pages (and please tell me if it does so I can go back and reread it) I just did NOT get why this is at the top of every Best Books Ever list. That's why I read it, but that kid just got on my damn nerves and I really didn't see what all the hype was about!"
1542,Urbain,Absolutely nothing happens in this novel. The most depressing read I ever had.
1543,Tinulicious,Boring 
1544,N," Some of the books on the 100 to read before you die made your brain die, this is one of them. I threw this book down in disgust every 4 pages. Urgh. "
1545,~v,"It has been a long time since I've read this book but I remember very well that I was quite dissappointed. The language is pretty foul and although I suppose one could say it helped demonstrate Holden's feelings of teenage angst and alienation - it really did nothing to add to the story. There is no real ending to this story either and overall it's not so much depressing as it is a ""downer"". I can't think of a single way this book enlightened or uplifted me and can't recommend it."
1546,Oznasia,"My bookshelf on goodreads does not really reflect the number of books I've read. I'm 63 and have read thousands of books in my lifetime. I can't remember all the titles. What goodreads is doing for me is encouraging me to revisit some of those books and perhaps reevaluate them. And so yesterday, while I was in transit, I picked up 'The Catcher in the Rye' to which I'd previously given a score of 3. It's an easy read and after a few hours I was approaching the half-way point. I put it down for a while.I noticed later that I was feeling quite depressed. OK, so I was somewhere I didn't want to be but I should have been able to handle that better than I was. Some time later I picked Catcher up again. I didn't read much more before it hit me that this was what was depressing me. I put it aside. I won't bother to finish. I don't need this.It occurs to me that schools put this book onto teenagers in their English classes. I have to ask: do they really need it?Not recommended."
1547,Melynda Yesenia,"recently someone told me that he'd read this and not liked it when he was younger but reread it much later and his perceptions changed. maybe this will also be the case with me.the magic of this novel all lies with holden's voice and try as i might, admittedly not very hard, i just can't like the guy. i've heard that that's the point, to not like him very much but i also don't care. so he's wasting his time, does that mean i have to waste mine reading about it?i'll try again in twenty or so years but i'm starting to get the impression that catcher is something that should be first experienced when the reader is teen-aged so that some of holden is hanging around in the mind. i was already an old person at seven; i think i missed my chance at that kind of empathy."
1548,Anthony  Corbo,"J.D Salinger was a talented writer for sure but I did not like this book. This book inspired a lot of people. Maybe they could relate to this young character's narrative but I couldn't. I first read this way past high school. I made a choice not to ever read the same book more than once, to many books I want to read, not enough time on the planet to read them all. But making an exception this time to maybe get a different perception. As it stands now, I feel 'Catcher In The Rye ' sucks. And why do so many nut jobs in our documented history cling to this book? I do think you should read it though, if ya haven't already, kind of a right of passage thing ya need to do in life. There is an acquired taste for this book, I do not have this acquired taste."
1549,Rachel,"I had to read it for a very annoying class, so i counldn't really get into it. Gonna have to read it later on my own time."
1550,Arnold Mukuvare,"How is this book amongst 100greatest novels? I hate this some teenager that hates everything and thinks they know better. this really should have finished in the first 4 chapters, such a boring book Gosh.I get that he is a hypocrite and all so what again. Screw you Holden"
1551,Swetha,"There are those sporadic moments when you hate a book so vehemently even before reading it. I experienced that when I came to know the truth behind John Lennon’s assassination. Infamous Mark Chapman’s words ‘The inspiration behind my killing can be found in The Catcher in the Rye’. So you could say, I was predisposed from the very start. Curiosity took the better of me and I craved to know what would push a person to that black corner.Just one word comes to my mind: Blasphemy. If Chapman thinks John Lennon is phony, he needs to recheck the definition of that word in his dictionary. I didn’t know Lennon and he was killed even before I was born, but I am sure a person who crafted ‘Imagine’ cannot be so. So what if he says ‘Imagine no possession’ and lives grandiosely? Seriously, if you think that is phony, every single music artist must be murdered. I can’t begin to talk about how much I hate the book NOW. Without much ado, because the novel does not deserve more than 2 shits, I would like to state something that I did, that I wouldn’t do in customary circumstances. I wrote ‘Please give up your reading now’ on the 5th page. Anger was on my fingertips. I wish I had written it on the first page but my librarian always checks that very page. "
1552,Chanel11,"This book was repetitive to the EXTREME. Words like, and all, goddamit, horse around, crumby etc get driven into the ground and just make you mad. The character is completely annoying in his repetitiveness, selfishness, un-founded misery etc. Just a horrible person to have to listen to for the entire book.I don't even know what the point of this book is. All of his opinions just got on my nerves - in the words of the Schwarzenegger - STOP WHINING!"
1553,Angie,why do people love this book so much?? why is holden caulfield such a great character? is it because i didnt read this book until after college?? i don't understand the hype.
1554,Allie,"I feel like one of the few people in this world that actually DIDN'T like this book. I was named after an omnicsient character in it, so I thought I would check it out. Holden's character is just...well...too annoying. If I met him in real life, I'd tell him to suck it up and get a reality check."
1555,Tim,"The literary significance of this book does not escape me. I can see why it has made such a stir, especially back in the day. But I really did not like this book. After I read it, I simply could not think of the point. That is time I will never get back."
1556,Tanya,"I was very excited to read this book knowing how popular and highly recommended it is. But unfortunately I was disappointed from the very beginning. I did not like the poor language (with all the slang and bad words) of the main character at all and did not really find the story interesting (for me it was more about nothing) but still continued reading till the end. Well, I did not change my mind and I really do not like the book. Although tastes differ and I do not doubt that the novel might be interesting for teenagers (those who, to my mind, are not mature enough). It is my opinion. I am disappointed in ""Catcher in the Rye""."
1557,Danielle,i can't decide if this was the worst book i read in High School or Lord of the flies. Complete waste of time. 
1558,Luminita,"First time reading the book, at 30 years old, and I tried to finish it so fast just for the fact I couldn't take the depressed character any longer. I know this happens every day and every minute and is so sad the character and, even the people out there,are not giving themselfs a chance to get out of depression."
1559,Christopher Hicks,"I started reading this book on September 10th. My book club was reading banned books. I've always wanted to read this book. It's supposedly a ""Classic"" this one of the foulest, most obnoxious books i've ever read. The protagonist Holden is a 16 year old with severe mental issues. He's narcissistic, repetitive, foul mouthed (it's like every 5th word he said was a cuss word) he's obviously depressed (everything and everyone depresses him) he seems to be bipolar. At times I despised him but at times I felt sorry for him. He didn't seem to feel like most people loved him and it eluded that he had been sexually molested several times. He didn't care if he lived or died. The one bright spot in the book was his love for his sister Phoebe and her love for him. It took me almost a month and a half to read 277 pages because I could only read it in small amounts. I almost bought this book for my collection but i'm so glad I checked it out from the library instead. I gave it one star but if I could have given it a zero I would have. Absolutely despised this book!!!"
1560,Jacqueline Houston,Utterly depressing!
1561,Marjolijn,"Honestly, I was really disappointed after reading this book. I'd heard so many great things about it, and the story line did sound appealing to me, but apart from a few details, I didn't like this book at all.I know this is a classic, which is why I was so excited to read it. One of the first things I noticed was the way Holden acts. The manner in which he talks and the words he uses don't come off as natural. He uses all of these phrases that started irritating me pretty quickly. It doesn't feel like you're listening to a teenager, the whole thing felt a bit forced to me. I realize that the books is more than fifty years old and the slang may have changed, but it doesn't change the fact that I felt it was all a bit too crafted.Secondly, Holden. I get that the book is about a troubled teenage boy and that that's the whole point and all, but Holden's annoying! He finds everything depressing and if it's not depressing than it's phony. I didn't identify with Holden at all. He keeps doing all of these completely random things. He's making this big deal out of going to see his parents, who live a few blocks away. I get that he's scared of how they'll react to him being kicked out of school, but would he seriously rather walk around lonely, depressed and cold on the streets of New York for days? In addition to this, in about half the book we're just reading about Holden being lonely and depressed, getting drunk in a bar or sitting on a bench or in a hotel room.Lastly, I felt like there were a lot of random story lines that didn't add anything to the story. We don't get much explanation on how Allie died and how his family handled his death. DB is a bit of a random character who is mentioned but whom we don't learn much about. Then there's Jane, who Holden keeps mentioning but never calls. The only character who felt was actually essential to the story was Holden's little sister, Phoebe.Apart from all this negativity, there were actually aspects of the book I did like. There were a few parts that I thought were great, like the bit in which Holden tells Phoebe how he wants to be 'the catcher in the rye, and the very last chapter. If you ignore the repetitive phrases and slang, the writing is actually really good."
1562,Aiden Hatley,"I wasn't fond of this book at all. I really disliked the fact that the author kept repeating himself over and over. I have no clue what message the book had because nothing about the book was really memorable. It actually bored me to the point I would fall asleep. If you asked me what the book was about and to give you a summary i wouldn't know what to say, cause I literally was falling asleep the whole time. I would only recommend this book to people who could figure out what the meaning behind it is. But over all i did not enjoy this book at all and would not recommend it. "
1563,Mona,اصلا ازش خوشم نیومد. بنظرم خیلی داستان بی معنی ای بود و هیچ احساس یا حرف جدیدی برام نداشت. دیدگاهی که داشت خودمم دارم و خوندنش بینهایت خستم کرد. هی منتظر بودم بگه خب که چی؟ اخرش چی؟ ولی خب اینطور پرداختن بهش فقط برای من یک تکرار بی معنی بود بدون هیچ چیز جدیدی که داشته باشه برام و بدون هیچ سرو تهی! از خرید این کتاب خیلی پشیمونم! اصلا نمیتونم درک کنم واسه چی جایزه برده!! 
1564,Teea,"This book changed lives, really? I didn't relate to Holden and guys like him when I was 16 and I certainly don't empathize with him now. This book evoked a physical reaction as I turned the pages. Anger, frustration, and my gag reflex. I am so grateful that my life was impacted by very different literary influences. This note is not to influence anyone who is about to pick this novel up. It is merely an outlet for me to vent and purge myself and now I can let it go. "
1565,Phillip,"I keep on trying to give this book another chance, but I can never get more than a few pages in without Holden Caulfield annoying the shit out of me."
1566,Faith,"Why is this book a classic?Why?Maybe I'm just stupid, or I don't have the brain capacity to understand what the heck was going on throughout this novel, or what it was supposed to symbolize, but I COULD NOT get into this book.The only thing Holden seemed to talk about was himself, and he often praised himself, his writing skills, and his style of storytelling. He had this attitude that he seemed to hate everything in the world. Some people may feel sorry for him, but I really don't. He seems like a bitter kid that is undoubtedly immature and doesn't really know how the world works. Holden is meant to be around my age, and that fact makes me uneasy. I can't help but wonder how many other Holdens there are out there.The way it was written was annoying. He constantly drifted off topic and rambled about things that were unimportant, and then talked about everything that he hated and used ""goddam"" in every other sentence. Not to mention he repeated the word ""phony"" at least three times in most of the chapters and kept saying ""it killed me"" over and over again.Everyone in the freaking world EXCEPT FOR HIM, OF COURSE was a phony. EVERYONE. And, you know the funniest part? Holden was the biggest phony of all of them. He constantly hinted at the fact that he was a good writer and possessed some kind of talent, but it was ungodly annoying. Oh, and then there's that one paragraph of wanting to catch children. Straight out of freaking nowhere. He is suddenly obsessed with kids and has this overwhelming desire to catch them. Not to mention he pinches his sister's but and seems to always want to have a hand on her. It's disgusting, and disturbing.Urgh.I can't even describe how much I have come to despise this book.I've never read a book that has aggravated me more than this book. I've never hated a protagonist as much as I hate this one, and I've read some books that have INCREDIBLY stupid and unlikable protagonists. Honestly: WHY IS THIS A CLASSIC? And, again, I may just be an uncultured idiot, but even if I didn't get the main idea behind this book, I don't think anything will change the way I feel about the main character at least."
1567,Elaine H,"I hated this book, really hated it. I should say - I did not fully appreciate reading about a whiney, self-absorbed teenager. Perhaps indicative of a personal character fault of mine. "
1568,Rachel K,"Some interesting facts about J.D. Salinger's ""The Catcher in the Rye"" : Mark David Chapman, the man who shot John Lennon, was reading a copy of ""The Catcher in the Rye"" when he was arrested. He said in his police statement that the larger part of his personality was Holden Caulfied, while the smaller part of his personality was Satan.Police found a copy of the novel in John Hinckley Jr's apartment after he shot Ronald Reagan in 1981. Hinckley said he shot Reagan to impress actress Jodie Foster, whom he'd been stalking.In 1989, Robert John Bardo stalked and murdered actress Rebecca Schaeffer at her home. He was carrying a copy of the book when he was arrested.That is the only interesting thing about this book. Apparently murderers enjoy it. Should I feel relieved then, that I hate this book with every fiber of my being? From the very first sentence, in the very first chapter I knew how my feelings would be on this book. I will be honest in my review and say that I did not make it past the ninety page mark. I felt that I gave it more then a fair chance. There are too many good books out there to waste your time reading one that you despise. The writing ... was J.D. Salinger even a real author? How did this book get published let alone become a well known classic? The writing was just bloody awful, it made me cringe. I read classics to avoid this kind of writing ... this is like a cruel joke. Let's set aside the writing and focus on the story line for a minute ... oh wait, there isn't one! For the ninety pages that I did read, nothing happened. I'm used to slow paced books, but in ninety pages we didn't even get through one crumbly night of Holden's crumbly life (did I mention that the same phrases keep popping up over, and over, and over again!). I dislike Holden very much so. He is perverted and foul mouthed. Maybe he has some redeeming qualities further on in the book but I didn't care enough to find out. All of the characters in this book are as flat as the paper that they were written on. That aside, I couldn't stomach all of the vulgar language and sexual content. For instance, did you know that ""Goddamn"" is used exactly 245 times in this book?This book is not going back on the shelf. I'm going to sell it and use the money to buy a real classic."
1569,roland0_o,"I'm all right with a novel in which nothing happens. They can often be very illuminating stories. I'm fine with gloomy teenagers having feelings and sharing them with others. Go ahead. I just don't want to read them. Treading along this numbing, seemingly endless novel, the only illumination I received was in the form of a deep desire to stop reading. I don't want to read through two hundred pages of the collected wisdom of a depressed teenager. I'm sure its important to someone, just not to me."
1570,akaspirin,"I read a bit about it, and I think I get it -but I didn't like it. At all. So glad we didn't read it in school."
1571,Cristiano Bernardini,"Non capisco cosa questo libro abbia risvegliato in cos�� tanta gente, l'ho abbandonato a met�� strada senza rimpianti, l'unico sollievo �� stata la cessazione dello strazio."
1572,Aimee Shutt-garcia,"I bought this book because I had never read it, and I wanted to read a classic. Oh my, it was so hard for me to get through. I tried to sympathize with the character but he just seemed to be everything I was against growing up, very entitled feeling. I don't recommend this book at all."
1573,Max Solomon,"This book initially begins as a great coming-of-age novel; however, it goes downhill. Holden, the main character, is simply a prick. With catchphrases like ""phony"" and ""sunuvabitch,"" readers see his scorn for society."
1574,J.C.,"I read it so long ago I need to read it again.8-6-2012Just read it again and by page fifty I couldn't stand it any more but forced myself to continue because there had to be something redeeming that I had forgotten. There wasn't. Maybe that's why its considered a classic, because the character is so annoying he mirrors the society he is supposed to be against. To me it sounded like a bunch of pathetic complaining about nothing (talk talk talk without saying a thing) from a selfish, has-it-too-good brat that doesn't know what he is talking about in the first place."
1575,Христо Блажев,"“Спасителят в ръжта” на Селинджър по-скоро ще ви бутне от мостаhttp://www.knigolandia.info/2010/07/b... “Прочетох го и аз най-сетне този пусти Селинджър, дето го споменават под път и над път. Е не съм очарован, съжалявам. Приятелите ми смятат, че съм голямо мрънкало, което си има основанията, но такова мрънкало като хормонално нестабилния Холдън просто няма."
1576,Matt M,"When Phoebe asks Holdthem Cauliflowers to name one thing he likes, he immediately thinks that it's very difficult and ends up thinking about the guy who died and there was blood everywhere.I like to think that I, in the same way, when asked ""what did you like about the Catcher in the Rye"", will hesitate and found myself thinking of that time that a dentist had to fill fifteen cavities inside of my mouth. It doesn't matter that the episode is fictional, so is the Matcher in the Raw.My review of the Patcher on the Ray? Holunder Cauldron is the sort of kid I'd actively discourage my kids to be friends with - in part because that would mean having the obnoxious brat around. The language in the book is so American I could swear I have a D-Day stuck in my frontal lobe. The dash of suspected paedophilia doesn't improve things.The finale is slightly redeeming, I guess, but the Dasher of the Lye is like its main character: I don't intend to spend more than five minutes in its company from now on."
1577,Ale Gomez,"I don't give 0 starts because goodreads does not allowed me to. To say that the book is a completely, absolutely waste of time is TOO much to say about this book. It tells the story of a rich, jerk kid and how does he see the world. Only because one of my good friends recommended it to me, I finished. The story goes NOWHERE. If you go to a train station and wait there for some hours without doing absolutely anything else, believe me your time will be more worth it than reading this crap."
1578,Son,"Awful, could barely get through 50% of this book. I feel left out for not understanding the why this book is such a big deal!"
1579,Kara,"Because this book is always on best-ever lists, I decided I needed to read it. Yuck!! I should have stayed away. It was full of swearing and immoral behavior. I actually threw this book away!"
1580,August  Times,I got about half way through and had to put the book down. I was almost half asleep and found it surprising that I read as much as I did. It's frustratingly awful.
1581,Karl,"I hated this book vehemently. I give it one star only for its historical significance in that it was unique when it was first published. It was bland, had a depressing progression, inconclusive ending and disappointing story all around. I had high hopes for this book when I started reading it because of the big reputation it has. I thought it was not worth the time. "
1582,Tasha French, I honestly don’t see what all the hype is about. Everyone that I know that has read it loves it but I really didn’t. The first 150 pages of the book were this kid whining. If I would have had the ability to reach into the book and smack him I would have. I don’t know if there is someone out there that would like to tell me why this is supposed to be such an awesome book that I will be glad to hear it but I really didn’t get anything out of it. The ending was ok but I just feel that all the whining and calling people phony was just too much for me and the ending really didn’t make up for it.
1583,Ryan Dejonghe,"Abandon ship! Abandon ship! I must mark this one read, as in past tense, before another brain cell is cast overboard. I get the point, but not the prose. The payoff is not worth enduring the waves of drivel. The anyhows, somewhats, and kindas are drowning me alive. I knew my reading ship had hit the fatal iceberg once I reached the sea of repeated phrases—I was going down, fast. Mr. Caulfield, I hope you can swim, because I’m kicking you off. "
1584,Pamela,Still can't quite figure out why people think this book is so great but I guess for the time it was published I can see how shocking it was. Not one of my favorites though.
1585,Stefany GG,"Es de esos libros que odias o amas, a mi me pasó lo primero. No me gustó, batallé para leerlo y, la verdad, me da flojera reseñar."
1586,Paula de Vera,No sé si es que cuando lo leí era demasiado pequeña... Pero no me gustó nada :(
1587,Jason Fryer,"A fairly pointless book in my opinion. Just the ramblings of an incessant whiner. Basically a blending of hipsterdom, angst and whining distilled into a nauseating plotless ramble."
1588,Renelle Louise,"I literally had a hard time finishing this book. The plot was dry and it focused more on the internal ramblings of the main character. There are books that do the same thing but this is really......meh. I was hoping for a few play on words or an interesting perspective on things. I did get a kick out of finding some nice quotes from Holden but generally, I really didn't like this book. I respect other readers who can totally relate to this book but I'm sorry, I'm just not one of those people. "
1589,Adwait,"I didn't really like book. I just found the sentences and language to be irritating. I probably would have liked the book more if Holden hadn't been the one writing it. But that defeats the purpose, doesn't it? Nearly every sentence has ""goddam"" or ""and all"" in it. After every little funny thing that happens he goes ""that killed me"" or ""that killed Phoebe"". The ""and all"" thing was particularly annoying. I hate to have such an opinion about a book that's highly recommended by many. But such is life, I suppose. I wouldn't say I regret reading it but I definitely won't be reading it again. :)"
1590,Devin Winkelmann,"Okay. You know what? This is a good book insofar as it is well-written and the author hits every point he tries to make like the fist of an angry god; however, I will be DAMNED if I didn’t hate every fucking word of it, from “if” to “everybody.”I don’t hate the book because I don’t “get it.” I’m sorry, all you lit buffs, but the themes in this book are about as subtle as a sledgehammer to the face. I’m Not Kidding. The Point is bullshit.Holden is many things, but at the root of it all, he is a “free thinker.” He would be able to deal with all of the usual growing-up problems if it wasn’t for that simple fact. He is counter-everything and struggles against the whole damn world. So with this book, Salinger takes the concept of “free thinking,” puts it up on a pedestal, and through Holden, he shows us how absurd it is – or, if we’re sixteen, he seduces us with it, and then he has the last laugh when we pick it up a year later and realize how absurd we were. We are supposed to want to bash Holden’s head into a wall. Why? Because one clearly cannot go against the grain of society without also being an insufferable, hypocritical, wearisome bitch at the same time. Free-thinkers are phony, teenagers are phony, emotion is phony, and life is phony, but it’s no use trying to avoid that because you will end up in a nuthouse if you do, so you might as well go with it. Or maybe not. Apparently it doesn’t matter.I don’t buy it. I think it’s a stupid point. I think this is a stupid book. It was bullshit and ultimately not worth suffering through 277 pages of a typical hipster’s whining stream of consciousness. Salinger could have at least thrown us a bone in the end and killed Holden or made him go postal, but we don’t even get that. Maybe it’s for the best. I could just imagine Holden narrating his own death.“I mean I am actually dying right now. I’m not kidding. It kills me. It really does.”And thus he would die, blasé ‘til the end. By the way -- this interpretation of the book is actually a kind one, because the way I see it, the only other option is that Salinger truly believes in Holden and thinks his cause is noble, just, worthwhile, etc., and that is even more absurd. Any way I look at it, I hate this book and all it stands for."
1591,Samantha,This might be my least favorite book of all time...I know it's a classic and people love it...but I found it extremely disturbing.
1592,Garyfalia,Much ado about nothing!
1593,Brandy,"i was definitely not a fan of this book. although, i read it back in 8th grade(ish) and it went way over my head. so i read it again this time, but i still didnt like it. plus the language! i dont like books with that kind of language."
1594,Jemima Elsherbini,Worst book in the history of the world. How can anyone read this? I had to read it for English and all that I learned from it was that Holden was a spoiled brat that couldn't do anything. Definitely the worst thing I have EVER read.
1595,Christopher,"Had no sympathy for the main character. The book never got better, Basically a large disappointment for me. I got the angst but not a book I would re read anytime soon. Sorry Salinger you aren't a great. There is not a negative star to give this book what it deserves. Total waste of time. "
1596,Carissa,FALSE
1597,Krys,"This morning I decided that I will not finish this book. The narrative is stagnant. The protagonist is despicable, his point of view myopic, and his insights, superficial. I don't like to critique a work I haven't finished, and this is why I hesitated before giving the book the X. Yet I think I've read enough, leniently, to suspect that, despite my incurable kalopsia, I have exhausted all possible positive interpretations available to me. At best, I conclude that it was Salinger's intention for me to hate his character. Holden Caulfield, is a metonymic device, standing in for the ignorance and arrogance of my own youth. Perhaps he is the right vehicle for my catharsis, as the wholly unlikeable protagonist embodies the self-righteous fog of my own youth. If this is the credit owed to Salinger, I pay it gladly. It's also highly possible that, because I have not finished the book, I miss the character development that makes 117 pages of tedium (out of 214) worth it. This nagging prospect keeps me up at night, wondering if I will miss out on the great maturation of Holden Caulfield. Unfortunately (or thankfully) the book puts me to sleep. I can't fathom that it was Salinger's intention to bore and annoy me with his character's journey to maturation. I found myself impatiently scanning pages of repetitive ""insights,"" craving another perspective, wishing for scenes to end.  With a bit of hesitation, it gets the X. Maybe I'll come back to it, one day...right now, there are simply too many other books I wish to read. 2 stars instead of 1 as I didn't finish the book.**"
1598,Heather K,Can't force myself to finish this either. Main character is very obnoxious. Another one maybe I should have read when I was younger. 
1599,Sara Waller,I wish I could un-read this insufferable novel. 
1600,Kaitlyn  Saunders,"I really disliked this book. I DO NOT understand why some people gush over this book. He's just a whiny kid who keeps getting kicked out of school. The book has no plot, and besides the minor symbolism that is cool for three seconds after you figure it out, it's completely uninteresting. Be quiet, Holden, and give me a real classic. "
1601,Werehare,"3,5/10Mah, mah e ri-mah. Mi aspettavo una mezza schifezza, ma non di queste dimensioni. Di carina c'è l'atmosfera da college inglese, i personaggi-macchietta su cui si ride, la caratterizzazione dal tratto efficace che rende l'idea senza troppe spiegazioni, la sensazione di frustrazione e di insensatezza che spinge Holden a lasciarsi trascinare dalle cose e a finire per combinare stupidaggini anche divertenti. Ma tutto il resto è ben sotto la leggibilità: Holden tristanzuolo, insensato e stordito come un procione dall'inizio alla fine, finale apertissimo se non proprio inconcludente, scrittura irritante oltre ogni limite - chi non ha voglia di afferrare la motosega e farla finita dopo duecentoquaranta pagine di ""vecchio"", ""vattelapesca"", ""non scherzo"" ed ""eccetera"" ogni due parole? E non sto esagerando, se in ogni frase non ci sono almeno tre di queste quattro espressioni l'autore pare non essere soddisfatto. Capisco che sia gergo gggiovane, ma la ripetizione ossessiva mi svanga alquanto. E poi ripetizioni, digressioni, frasi da tre parole, che va bene, rendono la scrittura immediata del giovanotto, ma alla lunga sono pesanti (e poi Holden non era bravo in inglese? A me proprio non è parso). Inoltre molte scelte lessicali del traduttore mi lasciano perplessa. Infine, capisco che Holden adori oltre misura i propri fratelli, ma tutta questa propaganda a oltranza mi ha - stranamente! - stufata a morte. (Se non altro, ora ho capito da chi ha scopiazzato Brizzi)"
1602,Mego,"I don't like Holden, ergo I don't like this book. Perhaps it was because I read this book when I was a cynical teen, but damn that kid bugged. I wanted to take him by the shoulders and shake some sense into him. But alas that was not to be, I slogged on throught the whole book looking for what made this an American classic. I'm going to give it another try....someday.....maybe."
1603,Madolyn R.,"I picked this book as book that had bad reviews, I can see why. I couldn't even get through it. It's just some whiny wealthy kid complaining his life when he has nothing to complain about. Terrible."
1604,Billy,The book is only famous because it was being carried by John Lennon's murderer. A boring story about a whiny teenager who has nothing to grumble about as far as I can see and should think himself lucky. Typical middle class teenage pseudo-angst rot. 
1605,Betty,This is one of the strangest books I've ever read. It was difficult for me to buy into much about this premise and setting. It was also frustrating to feel there's no plot when I was more than half-way done with the book. At least now I can say I've read it. I still wonder what all the fuss is about and how many people can love this book.
1606,Ashley Mosso,"This book has absolutely no plot nor developement in it. I would not recomend this to anyone, unless they like repeatitive books with no storyline. It also does contain some bad language."
1607,Storiastone,"Note to future self: don't read a book just because it's a popular classic. I can't finish this book. I really tried, I did. I made it to page 189. But I have not laughed once, felt impressed by any witty insights, nor felt any emotional pangs. Nothing. So I can't justify wasting any more time on this book. There is no suspense, no mystery, no passion, no descriptive prose, and no actual story plot. It doesn't even feel like I'm reading a book, more like a diary from your typical John Doe. This book's popularity truly baffles me. To sum it up, it's really just unnecessarily cynical observations and thoughts from a jaded kid. I expected a lot more. I mean, who knows, perhaps I would've enjoyed it at least a little if I were younger and more easily impressed, but at my age of twenty-three and current frame of mind; I can safely say this book is insufferably boring."
1608,Madeleine,"i really hated reading this, it was torture, but i had to for school. there are words that are very repetitive. He thinks eveything is phony and everything makes him depressed. you cannot infer anything(except the ending)! the only good side to this book is the meaning behind the title."
1609,Jennifer Fulham,I wanted to throw this book out a window when i read it in hs. Makes you feel like you have depression
1610,Mallory,"I think I may have enjoyed it more if I was more able to relate to the dramatic adolescent angst that Holden, the main character, experiences. I felt like there was no story to the book. It was just a couple days in the life of Holden Caufield in New York city after failing out of high school, told by the ramblings of a boy who is very bitter towards society yet craves human contact. Then the book is done. The ending is abrupt and doesn't really give any closure to anything that's happened earlier in the book. Maybe there is a deeper meaning hidden beyond the words of the book that I am not understanding, but I prefer to read books that straight-up say what they want to say, instead of those with a cryptic underlying message that I will never figure out."
1611,mariam,"I'd started this book about three or four times since 2008 and gave up every time. This time I forced myself to sit down and really give it a go, but it still barely held my interest. I can't help but feel like this book is extremely overrated!"
1612,Richard Epstein,"In my Top 10 Most Overrated Books of All Times, Yet Sold to Students as the Real Deal. Ranks even higher on that list than The Old Man and the Sea and To Kill a Mockingbird."
1613,Shylashree Chikkamuniyappa,"BORING !!!! 17 year old Holden Caulfield ousted from a prep school (not his 1st one either) recalls a few of his so called 'phony' friends and incidents. He even recounts a visit to his history teacher's house who embarrases him by reading his test paper aloud. On the train back home, he lies to lady who has her son at prep school; calls a parent faking someone's name and then reaches home to meet his little sister and changes plans to stay back in NY, maybe attend another school, rather than run off to SFO to live as a deaf-mute. I felt his character to be whiny, emotional and irresponsible......rebellion and alienation for what????"
1614,Robyn,"All I can say is ""BORING""! OMG, I could NOT figure out what the hype was about this book or WHY on earth it would have ever been on a ""banned"" list!"
1615,Brant O.,"SO BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If I was interested in the life of whiny, spoiled, rich kids and their 'problems' I'd watch those MTV sweet 16 shows... So boring."
1616,Venus Emma,I hate myself for reading this more than I hate the book itself. Such a waste of time. Not sure if I'm way beyond Holden's issues or he's really just the biggest phony character I have read in my 25 years of existence. 
1617,Amber,Had to read this book in high school and hated it. I decided to give it another chance but stopped half way through. Just not my style I think. 
1618,Sila Sayan,"It's been a while since I've read this book and maybe I need to revisit it seeing as how my dislike of the book seems quite atypical. As it is though, I felt like Holden was an irritatingly melodramatic youth whose character the book seems to try to develop but never quite salvages him from being just as superficial as the ""phonies"" he hates. Sure, which one of us didn't taste the sweet nectar of melodrama during our teen years, but, to me, Holden had no real redeemable qualities that would have made his agression and general hatred toward the world bearable as an unpleasant but acceptable part of an otherwise interesting and full person. Holden is a prisoner to a single, very small portion of the whole spectrum of human emotion, and he really doesn't express and experience this very limited sentimental world in any particularly interesting ways. While reading the book, I mostly just found myself grunting, sighing and wanting to slap some life into Holden."
1619,Little,"I finally got around to read a book that was popular in high school, but it was such a letdown. Holden Caulfield is a spoiled, whiny, and does nothing but complain about ""phonies"" but is himself a phony. It was so irritating that I was wishing in the end he would just end his misery, so I could also end my misery of reading this book. Alas, I was only relieved when the book ended and I could move on to the next book. "
1620,Lynn,"A really good friend was reading this. I said ""What's all this I hear about it?"" She says ""It's probably my favorite book ever."" I read it and hate 99% of it."
1621,Betty Tindle,"I tried to read this. I could not. It was awful. I don't know if it is my age, 52, but at I had a really hard time just getting through a paragraph without putting the book down. It was toooooo...juvenile which may sound terrible but that is exactly how I felt while reading it. Too juvenile. What also struck me was the similarity in writing with the fictional private eye/detective whose name I cannot think of at the moment. Spade, Marlowe? Probably can't think of it because I didn't like those either. :) Just my 2 cents."
1622,Happycat,"I was told that all middle schoolers are suposed to relate with Holden Caulfield, but I found I couldn't. Holden likes to go and meet with people just so that they can annoy him and he doesn't know how to commit himself in school. This book was a complete downer, because it made me confront someone living life in a way I fear to live life. "
1623,Rosabelle Purnama,"I didn't really like this book. I didn't really get the story. The book just tells the story of Holden Caulfied who got kicked out of school and of his journey home. I find the Holden character is annoying and overthinking of situations most of the time. He's lonely and a bit imaginative I think. Reading this book makes me feel so tired, that the first pages of the next book that I read after this feels like a breeze to my brain. "
1624,Andy,I don't understand the point of this story. I mainly managed to finish the book because school kids are made to and I didn't want to have to say I couldn't do it.
1625,~M~,"I had been wanting to read this book for quite some time and thanks to my GoodReads iPhone app, when I was at the library I was able to remember to get it! Thanks GoodReads!But I just could not get into it. Maybe if I had read it in high school I would have identified more with Holden's sense of alienation. Instead, as a middle aged woman with REAL problems, I was impatient of his constant whining. I am sure the parents of teenagers understand what I am talking about here. The book is stream of consciousness, so the whole book is pretty much a peek inside Holden Caufield's mind, and it's a rather unpleasant place to visit.I'm glad I tried to read it, but I don't think I'll bother with it any more."
1626,Booksdingle,"I know this is considered to be a classic but I didn't like it at all, ditched it after about 50 pages, disliked the writing style and the overuse of goddamnit! and I was bored - onto another classic"
1627,Frank,This is a classic? Would it even be published if it came out today?
1628,Brett,"Anyone who claims this is their favorite book is pretentious. If 'ole JD Salinger was attempting to illicit a very negative response from his reader towards Holden Caufield, then mission accomplished. I couldn't stand this book from start to finish.Rebellion for rebellion's sake is just silly in the extreme."
1629,Brunhilde,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I have tried to read this book few times in various stages of life. I hate giving up on a book, any book, especially one so acclaimed, but i just couldn't do it. But seriously, it is a whiny, depressy, pubescent boy and I just couldn't do it. Maybe I needed to be younger to really get it or just male. But my life is too short and there are way too many books to spend one more second on this one. "
1630,S0fetch,"Two ends of the spectrum: you either worship this novel or you hate it. I'm one of those who hated it. I was really disappointed by this novel considering all the hype it has gotten such as 'life changing' and 'impressively written'. When I picked this up, I did not even bother to read the summary like I usually do because I thought this book would definitely be a good read but it wasn't. I didn't like really like the writing style of the book and I was sort of annoyed at Holden. I get that even he hates the hypocrite he himself is but I just find it hard to sympathise with him. The concept of this story was OK but if the writing style has been changed, I think I may like this book more. It was a miracle that I even finished reading the book. In all, overrated.and wasn't even life-changing at all!!"
1631,Michael Hsu,"Quoting the character of Tom Hanks in the movie “Big” when asked to review a toy he said “I don’t get it”. With much anticipation, I start reading this book expecting to be enlightened as to why this book is so famous and highly recommended. Chapter by chapter, I read eagerly for the enlightenment to come. Unfortunately, I ran out of chapters. It was very challenging reading about a delusional person who is pissed off at the world. "
1632,nella,"Seriously, Holden, quit your whining.I can't see what's so impressive about a kid who can't figure out what he wants and so wastes his potential. Surely there's got to be more than moaning about being ""phony"" when you're phony.Random fact: I actually started using the word ""grand"" because Holden Caulfield didn't like it."
1633,Bill,"I had to read this in 11th grade. My teacher insisted that she had never had a student who didn't like it. I guess I was her first.I hated this book. The protagonist drove me crazy. He whined and complained about his life so much I just could not relate to him at all. He was pitiful and his aversion to ""phony"" people was boring and his fixation on it became redundant as the book went on.There was nothing I enjoyed about this book."
1634,"L. (I need one of these, do they come in threes? cuz I need to squeeze them)","Oh, how I hate Holden Caulfield. Hate! Hate! Hate! I wanted Hannibal Lecter to eat Holden's liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti, that's how much I hate him."
1635,Davie,"Davie Fowlkes5/8/08American RebelProjectCatcher in the Rye is a very interesting book. I have never read a book like it. There was so much rebellion, so much sex, just so much of everything. It just something I would never expect in a book. Sounds like a good book right? Don’t you think it is weird that I hate this book? I am not saying it is a bad book. I just do not like to read. Books like that frustrate me cause you don’t know what’s going on. To me, Catcher in the Rye was a very boring book. It did not seem like he did very much in the story. It just seemed like he just went places and did stuff like something that any kid could do (besides the sex). Going to an ice rink and taking a girl that you like is something that I do not want to read about. I live that kind of stuff. Another example is all the drinking that they did. We experience so much drinking in our world today that it seems completely normal to us. There is so much underage drinking I thought it was no big deal when it said it in the book. Why would anybody want to read about something that they could do any time of the day? I guess in those days this book was not really acceptable to society. The book was well made. There was plenty of symbolism. It had everything that a great book has. That just means that I do not like any of those other books like “To Kill a Mockingbird.” J.D Salinger was a genius with his work; he had a lot of hidden stuff inside the text; it is just something that I do not really like. It just bothers me when you think that it is one thing but it really is the other. Why can’t they just say what they mean and get on with the story. How do we even know what he meant to say in his book? Why can’t J.D Salinger mean what he just said in the story with no hidden meaning? People over analyze everything.This book was a very rebellious book back in the day. If people were to read that book around that time of year, J.D Salinger would be in a lot of hot water. Today some of that stuff is completely normal or more common that it was back then. That could be a reason that I do not like it. I am just used to all the stuff that is happening in the story. Holden, the main character, is a high school drop out that thinks he can do just fine all on his own. He is very different compared to any other character in any other book. He takes crap from nobody, he thinks he knows it all, and everything thing he says about himself; he really likes the opposite. That was something that really got on my nerves. You never know what he really likes or dislikes.I did not think the story really had a plot. It is just a kid that drops out of school and he is living on his own. There was not really a point to the story. He was not trying to accomplish some goal or do something amazing. He just some kid that is just trying to make it in the world. It sounds like a biography but in first-person. I want a book where something happens like in “Lord of the Rings” or “Harry Potter.” Books like that have a plot and a good one too.This might sound weird but I recommend it to anybody that likes to read. I am just do not like those kind of books. If I did like those kinds of books than I would love that book, but I like the fantasy books where the brave knight has to rescue the princess in the tower. This book is really good if like those kinds of books that have nothing but symbolism and hidden meanings everywhere in the book and you like to find them and figure out what J.D Salinger is trying to tell his or her readers."
1636,David,"There has never been a book more suited for ""lonely"" and ""self-loathing"" mid- and upper-middleclass white folks then this.Wah wah wah."
1637,Adam Pohl,"This is one of the worst books I've read. Even most people I've talked to about it seem to agree. The protagonist is not a coming of age teenager, hes just a psychotic fuck. I don't want to know what kind of a terrible person would identify with this kid and I don't know why this book receives any praise."
1638,Taylor,Hated the pointless plot to this story. I don't need to read about someones unrealistic and pointless epiphany. 
1639,Bart,"I first read ""Catcher in the Rye"" in high school like most kids did. I don't remember what I thought then but would guess I was like most kids and liked the rebellious kid taking on the world. I figured I should read it again since my oldest son will be reading it soon. Oh my! It might be the worst book I have ever read. A kid might find this book charming as they go through their rebellious years. Grow up! J.D. Salinger was obviously a troubled and wierd guy himself and probably much like Holden Caulfield. It just amazes me that this book makes top 100 lists."
1640,Ron,"It is no surprise that this novel had great resonance for disaffected youth in 1951, but I read it as a 35 year old adult in 1997 and was not only bored, but overawed by the pedestrian writing. It is no surprise to me that Salinger disappeared, shamed at the undeserved fame and adulation he received."
1641,Jade,The most pointless book I've ever read. 
1642,Catherine,"Can you give a book lower than a one? Is that possible? Honestly, I shouldn't even be marking this book as read because I only managed the first 30 pages or so before turning to SparkNotes purely to get me through my English assessment. Holden was a horrible character and I found him whiny and impossible to relate to or empathise with. Salinger's writing style, as opposed to drawing me into the novel and allowing me to appreciate the character's inner thought, only served to further irritate me. Do not recommend. "
1643,Barb,"Maybe I need a new shelf for ""didn't finish it, not going to."" I found the writing annoying. I could slog through it if I had to for an English class. But I don't have to."
1644,Carolyn Mackenney,I wanted to like it because I had heard so much about it for so many years. But I found it frustrating and did not like Salinger's writing style at all. 
1645,Ros,"I wanted to add this to my books just so I could give it ONE STAR. Take that, Holden Caulfield! This may warrant a reread at some point (especially if I develop into a masochist), but I hated this book when I first read it, and I probably still do."
1646,Katie,I always wanted to read this book and I was so disappointed in it. I found it to be so boring and there was no plot whatsoever. 
1647,Shar,I read this book in high school. It was one of the very few books I actually had to force myself to read and finish .. coming to a point of almost deciding to cheat and read cliff notes instead.It's been a several years so I can't describe what I didn't like about the book in much detail just that the storyline never caught my attention. 
1648,Donielle Barlan,"This is terrible. I read through the first half of the book in just a few hours, but now it's dragging. Nothing is happening and I am MISERABLE. This may be the first book I give up on and never finish. "
1649,Shay,I don't know what the fuss is about. Guess I'm just not an english lit. pro. I honestly didn't even really read it because it was so dumb and boring to me. I skimmed though the whole thing in a night then tossed it in the charity pile. 
1650,Andreea,"To say that I hate this book for what it is and for how it's become so popular and chosen to be officially included as a literary masterpiece is an understatement. Not only do I hate and find little to no use for the story, but I hate Holden Caulfield for the character he is. To discuss every single thing I despise about this book would take too long in detail, so instead I shall discuss it in list-form:1. Holden as a delinquent who doesn't care about school. I get that he's supposed to be an inner reflection of what a lot of guys were at the time, but shouldn't the main characters be more inspirational than loathsome? There is literally nothing inspirational about Holden.2. His view of girls. As a feminist and a female, I am highly insulted by it.3. The location. I'm just not into big-bad-city locations, so this was an added tone of hatred for me. If anything, it would've been more acceptable if he wrote more about his school life.4. The inconsistency. At first I thought it would be a narrative about his school life and his dealings with people like his roommates or classmates, but it tastes a drastic turn into the city location near the middle of the book, almost as if Salinger's attempting for two different stories.5. Holden as a hypocrite. Enough said on that one.6. The depiction of the world of ""phonies"" as a bad and terrible thing. Holden just doesn't have a grip on reality with this one.7. The constant repetition of some of Holden's phrases. They can get annoying after a while.All in all, one of the worst books I've ever read. Not the absolute worst, but definitely in the low 10."
1651,Joel Allyn Skoda,"I know I will catch a load of shit for this and I plan to reread it again, but after all the hype over this book when I finally read it I found it to be simply awful and extremely boring. I understand the importance it has to literary history and I get that Holden Caulfield was the first teen protagonist suffering through teen angst and rebelling against growing older while trying to hold on to the innocence and genuineness of youth, but he just came off as a whiny twit to me. I don't subscribe to loving a book just because it is labeled a classic, that being said 'To Kill A Mockingbird' is one of my favorites of all time, and I think that is a much better take on adult realities imposing on a child's innocence. "
1652,Chasnta,"This is one of those that they forced us to read in school. I honestly hated it even though I know it's a ""classic"". I totally disliked the main character."
1653,Els,"As a 17 year old feminist reading this book for my English class, everything about Catcher in the Rye offended me. I couldn't stand Holden (and it is completely besides the point that I'm not suppose to be able to relate to him) and I think there are far better books out there that have the same sort of literary high-brow that teachers want while relating better to both men and women. It was painful having to read through Salinger's whiny narration of Holden and I felt just a hare too jaded to be sympathetic about being afraid of growing up and what responsibility entails. This felt like a desperate plea to harken back to the Romantic period and cherish childhood and warn about the evils of organized education and adulthood."
1654,Thisun,I personally felt as though i could not connect with Holden thoruhgout the entire novel. Quite annoyed at how the story was portrayed in a self-centered manner. Overall quite a pain to read. 
1655,Norman,Read it when you're 16 and you'll think JDS is a genius who really understands how you feel.Read it when you grow up and you'll realise that HC is a whining little shit who deserves everything he gets.
1656,Anne-Marie Whisnant,"I didn't identify with Holden Caulfield at all. The things he loathes I tend to like, and the things that give him pause make no sense to me. I hated the narrative style of the book and forgive me for being a grammar fanatic but the loose syntax of the writing irritated the hell out of me. Suffice it to say that I did *not* enjoy this book. I'm in the ""Let's take Holden Caulfield out back and beat him senseless"" camp. This book has no merit in my opinion and the fact that so many people found it so fetching is one of those anecdotes that even Holden himself would deem ""phony"". It just kills me. *rolls eyes*"
1657,Alison Lewis,"Not my style, but am glad that I read it :) While the writing style was interesting, I felt that the storyline itself was lacking - I just kept waiting for something to happen... (I know, I know, it's a classic, you can hate me for my taste in books, go for it...)"
1658,Kitty,"After trying to finish this for ages, I retire it. Holden Caulfield is an enormous tool. The narrative is annoying and needlessly wordy. I also now loathe the word phony."
1659,Megan,"Horrible. Truly horrible. An unsympathetic and uninteresting protagonist leading a selfish, uninteresting existence."
1660,Tara Lynn,"On a recommendation from someone at work, I tried this for the third time. (My boss is on a business trip, and I've been doing some long awaited E-book reading at work.) Holden Caufield is the first EMO kid. I don't care what anyone else has to say about it, reading about his constant whining makes me want to have my teeth drilled. Why couldn't someone have dropped this idiot into the Lord of the Flies and had Jack and his band eat him?"
1661,Sasha,"I thought this book was AWFUL. The story was nonexistent, the main character was boring, and the vocabulary was that of a 10-year-old who has just learned his first curse word. I don't know why this is called a classic. It's pathetic."
1662,Manoel Campos da Silva Filho,"Imaginei que a história fosse mais original e impressionante, no entanto, me deparei com uma história boba de conflitos adolescentes.Apesar de não ter achado nada demais no livro, a história entretem e realmente li até o fim."
1663,Katharine,"Probably the most tedious and annoying book I've ever read. If I hear the word ""phony"" one more time, I will lose it! Reading this book is like listening to the song ""Blurred Lines"" on repeat! This book is extremely overrated. "
1664,Bryan,"I can only assume that this book got the hype it did because of when it was written. It was probably challenging to the mainstream of the time and represented a whole new attitude. However, I found the main character to be not only uninteresting but annoying. His little adventure and his arrogance about himself grated my every last nerve."
1665,KanaMarie,My English Teacher in Japan lent me her copy. I find you either love it or hate it. I unfortunately fall in the latter category. Perhaps it was a translated copy? I just didn't enjoy this book in the least and was quite bored with it.
1666,Jamie Hansen,I think this book now has the unique distinction of being the worst book I have ever read. It is certainly my least favorite at any rate. I really really really really didn't like it. I found Holden to be insufferable and the plot devoid of any meaningful direction or development. I have some strong reactions and a slight desire to articulate these feelings at least in part but my stronger inclination is to not devote even another minute to J.D. Salinger's so-called classic. 
1667,Kallum,"This book annoyed the hell out of me, after all the talk about it being such a good book, I was constantly waiting for something to happen. What a load of rubbish."
1668,Kevin Schvaneveldt,This book sucked an entire bag full of dicks. It had about one paragraph worth of valuable reading material. The best that can be said is that the main character is a good example of how men shouldn't act 
1669,Adrian,I think I might be one of the only people in the world who truly didn't like this.
1670,Lynn Robey,"I suppose the author was a very good writer because by the end of the book, I did not care for Holden. I was very disappointed in this book and would not recommend it to anyone."
1671,Kristie,"I hear this is a book you hate or a book you love, there's no in between. I was one that hated it. Holden just bugged me to no end--he seemed so arrogant and self-important. The fact that I had to read this for school has no impact on why I disliked it. There were plenty of other books that were ""required reading"" that I LOVED. This was not one of them."
1672,Nina Edlund,I hate this book. I hate it so much. Reading it just made me want to reach into the book and slap the crap out of the main character. 
1673,Sydne,"When I read this book, I must have been one or two years too old for it: I was annoyed with the childishness of Holden, his pathetic self-centredness and how important he considered his little issues to be. A couple of years later, I read Paul Auster's Moon Palace and I was reminded of it- by then I was definitely too old for this teenage angst keeping two perfectly normal youths from taking their lives into their hands. At this point at the latest I do sound old, but even as a 16 year-old I couldn't find anything for myself in this book."
1674,Jeff,"Definitely overrated! I don't, & don't care to, understand the hoopla."
1675,Sharessa,"What can I say, I'm not a fan of anti-heroes, especially not whiny ones. Perhaps it would have been better if I were introduced to this in a class. "
1676,711jesse,i only read up to page ike 10 and i dis liked this book so much that i wanted to just rip this book up and never hear this title again. it was just so boring and not enjoyable. Alot of people like it but it just an opinion and it just was not a good book at all.
1677,Solveig,"Really obnoxiously written book, with a narrator I felt like smacking within five minutes of reading."
1678,Britt,"I read this a number of years ago when my high school daughter was forced to read it in English.I read it through carefully and found it a worthless, trashy piece of literature. I have no clue whatever why it receives high ratings from anyone. I would NEVER recommend it for a high school student."
1679,Helena,Waste of a read. The plot didn't go anywhere and it was very slow paced! Overrated!
1680,Sydney Rumping,"When i read this book in the beginning i thought, Holden seems cool, like an average kid, but after the third chapter i didn't want to read the book anymore. I wanted to take Holden by the neck and choke him. He was a stupid player, wanna-be and a lonely boy who needed to get a life. He's self centered, a drunkard, stupid, and needed to GROW UP!! He actually needed to know that everything changes. Holden needed to get used to change. He's no better than any other drunk fake. Fake, fake, FAKE!!! I hate him and hate the book...if you like annoying people, then read the book. If you actually have a life and want to read something useful, read something else"
1681,Anne Pepper,"I understand the significance of the story and admire the prose, but I could not get into it at all. I really did not like reading this book in high school and I doubt I would feel differently now. "
1682,Nomad240,"A sad novel about nothing,pissing some kid off who thinks the world sucks..spoiler it ends with a bang.also I cannot believe this was the excuse given for the death of John Lenin"
1683,Brie,"It's odd how I came about this book. Maybe I began it in a negative mindset because it was hard to follow, taking up more concentration than I usually give. "
1684,Brooke Cunningham,"Yeah, I didn't actually finish. I'm half way through, and even though it is short, I can't finish. Maybe if I come back to it at a later point, I'll like it. For now, meh."
1685,Andrew Malizia,"I learned that this book and Holden Caulfield are overrated. Maybe it was the original teenage angst book or what have you, but I didn't connect to it at all."
1686,Ty,I thought this book was one of the worst books I've ever read. I don't know why people think the main character is so great. To each his own though.
1687,Shahrun,"I think this book was wasted on me. I just didn't see the point of what I was reading. I really can't understand why people rate it so much. Perhaps because of the shocking language throughout and occasional reference to sex was a surprise for when it was written? It's just a couple of days in the life of a teen who goes off the rails whilst struggling to cope with the loss of a sibling. I didn't find Holden particularly likeable, so I didn't care what happened to him."
1688,Katelynn Anzora,"ehh, not my type of book."
1689,Gjscollins,"I didn't like this book at all. It was so negative and I have heard that is part of what makes this book so ""good"" to people but it just got old for me. I didn't finish it as it was just one negative page after another! Blech. "
1690,Vicki Knapp halaja,"Had two cracks at this book, once in high school, once last year. 2nd time was worse than the first because I had high expectations. Awful. "
1691,Linda,Why is this a classic? Has anyone read this depressing book lately and why did they make us read it in high school? Crumby
1692,Apen,"Had to read it for the university . I hated it, I didn't even want to finish it. Holden is always complaining and speaking bad of others when he doesn't do anything at all. He says he hates the movies, but que goes to the movies. He is scare to do a lot of things and always says ""I wasn't feeling like it"". I just hated him, I know that he is a teenager and all the symbolism that the book is supposed to have but I don't care, it was boring. I kept reading expecting SOMETHING to happend, but there was no plot."
1693,Damaris Abbie,"A disappointing, meaningless story. And as for the ducks the protagonist is always asking about? They fly away because it's winter, and they're ducks. They're migrating. It's a bad symbol, and everyone in the book, including Holden, should understand migration. It's no big secret. "
1694,Liz Mutkins,"I am, as far as I know, the only person in the world who hates this book. Synopsis: Whinging adolescent complains about everything. Echh. "
1695,Shaheema,"I hate this book with a passion. Had to read it two years ago in 10 grade honors, and could not see the point of it for the life of me. Main character is the whinniest and most annoying-est character i have ever had the misfortune to read about. He doesn't even talk sensibly, he jumps from one thing to another. I hate books where the character doesn't make sense, and this was just that. I don't care if this is supposed to be one of the great american stories, i hated it. Okay im done."
1696,Jared Gallant,I'm so confused as to why this book is a classic. It is sadly very poorly written in my estimation. It took me over a year to read this rather short book as I had a very hard time caring about the character and was unable to immerse myself in the story.
1697,May,"I've tried reading this book 2 years back and couldn't get through more than a few chapters at the beginning. I hated how whiny Holden was, and I really dislike his tone and speech. I gave up after a few chapters and left the book aside, hoping that I may appreciate it in the future. Today, I thought I'd give it another go again and realised my dislike for the book has yet to change. I've even skipped to the end in hopes that it would change my mind about the book but it did not happened. All I can say is that I'll not be attempting a third time and I can safely give this book away to someone else that could perhaps appreciate it more."
1698,Max,"Not want to sound too harsh, but I just can not imagine how this book has become a classic and have a significant impact on world culture. So many people say they are finding a lot or, at least, a little bit in common with the main character, especially speaking of teenage age, but I didn't find similarities in myself. Everyone is a hypocrite, all brings sadness, there is nothing that would bring joy... Funny, always considered myself as too pessimistic, too melancholic, too depressed, but Holden's thoughts brought only irritation. Yes, there are bad days when nothing is fun, but it seems he think in this way all his life, and it looks not quite normal.The inability to find happiness at all. Everything is or not good enough, or way too good to bring true pleasure... Anyway, this book is also not bring me pleasure at all."
1699,Hazel,"It's one of those books that you either like it or not; you either see the light or you waste your time. For me, it was the latter but I won't be so harsh to give it 1 star. It was well written and really made you have a different perspective Yet, I could not stand Holden's character. I hard a hard time relating to a pessimistic character like himself. It also doesn't help that I was forced to read this for school. "
1700,Geoffry,"Ik begrijp wat Salinger hier probeerde te doen en waarom velen dit als een klassieker zien, maar mij laat het onverschillig."
1701,Brandie Lagarde,This was not required reading for me when I was in school and went all these years so I borrowed it from my 22 yr old daughters collection and made myself finish it. It was pointless and I still scratch my head to as why it is so famous.
1702,Mephi,"Had I been born a boy I'm sure this book would have resonated deep within my heart, reinforcing all sorts of troubles and turmoils rumbling around in my brain. As it was, when I first read this book in high school I felt a complete disconnect. Perhaps one day I'll feel morally obligated to give this book another read. Until then it's settled nicely into the slightly disappointing section of my bookshelf. "
1703,Lj Ruiz,The way how they say how bad the book is to kids because it's not a good book for kids to read cause their opinion states that some people say they are done with the book some people say it's a bad book for others and some say its a good book because there are good actions happen in the book there things that people could argue about the book. People relate this book to others.No this book shouldn't be taught to anyone my opinion.
1704,Evan Bartholomew,"This book in my opinion fails on most (if not all) accounts.Plot-wise, it barely kept me interested and just drudged from one thing to the next with just barely a thought.Character-wise, I hated the main character. If Salinger meant for this guy to be unlikeable, then he succeeded. Holden is a hypocritical, sporadic, unlikeable jerk and he doesn't even seem to realize half of this. He spends half the time dwelling on the fact that everyone is ""phoney"" when he's ""phoney"" himself!So obviously this fails to entertain. How about morality?Well, when he isn't swearing his little teenage mind off or deciding not to have sex with prostitutes, he ends up decided to just go along with what people are telling him to do and stay where he is and have counseling (or whatever it is he's doing while he's discussing his life story).The Catcher in the Rye is my least-favorite book for a reason. It fails to capture my interest while also failing to keep me uplifted. What's the point of it? If all it's good for is it's symbolism and connecting to the teenage mind, then first of all: Symbolism only works if the material is interesting enough, and second of all: I never even once related with this jerk or felt any empathy towards him."
1705,Rikki,"Holden Caulfield is a spoiled, irritating, obnoxious, self-obsessed brat who needs a good slap. I quickly tired of his whining about 'phonies'; in fact I only read to the end to see if he eventually discovered the great irony that he is the biggest phoney of them all. Alas, I was disappointed - the only redeeming feature of the entire book being that Caulfield is at least evidently hospitalised at the end, which is the best place for him.I'm sure this book was light years ahead of it's time - and as a groundbreaking work of social observation, it has merit. The colloquial dialogue did help to transfer me back to another time and place. It's just a shame Holden bloody Caulfield had to be in it."
1706,Cody Liska,"After reading this piece of trash I can kind of understand where Mark David Chapman was coming from. The Catcher in the Rye is meandering and cynical. The cynical I can deal with-- it was the only tolerable part of the book-- but the lack of plot, conflict and/or any sort of resolution was excruciating. I can appreciate the precedence this book set, but I don't have to like it. "
1707,Rikke,"This is actually a lie... I didn't finish the book, I just couldn't. I just didn't like the lead character - he was down right obnoxious, in my opinion. I still don't get why it has gotten such great reviews and why it keep popping up on bucket list after bucket list. With that said, I will most likely try to read it again later on in life. I have to try and finish it - maybe the good part comes in the end?(: "
1708,John Wiswell,Holden Caulfield is a phony.
1709,Jacklynn,"Holden is boring and the book is worse. I have never disliked a book as much as this one. I am thankful it was never ""required reading"" and I hope my kids never have to read it. I can't emphasize how bad this book was. It certainly deserves NONE of the infamy it has received. BAD, BAD, BAD. I have no idea how it was ever published. "
1710,Cindi,"This is one of those books that I'm supposed to love. But I just didn't get it. Maybe I don't connect on a spiritual level with snooty, rebel prep school boy. Does anybody have any clarification on the issue? I'd love it if somebody could tell me what I missed."
1711,Lexi Wolfe,"Most people tend to rave about how wonderful this book is and, to be fair, it was the first book I've hated reading which I read through to the end. I've never read any other Salinger and I'm afraid I now have no wish to. if nothing happened in an eloquent, Thought-provoking way, I could excuse it, but I found the childhood frustration and grumpiness actually incredibly annoying. I stuck it out but still had little sympathy for him at the end of the book."
1712,Orlando,"Sí... yo soy de los que odiaron el guardián entre el centeno. Cuando una novela envejece tan mal, simplemente nunca fue una buena novela."
1713,Chairoplane,"Argh! I hated this! This ""classic"". Argh again! Had to throw it away after 50 pages of pure guff."
1714,Crishell,"I had huge expectation for this book considering it's a classic, and after reading reviews that said it was brilliant. I was excited to read it. But after a few pages I began to hate Holden and the things he was saying! I cannot relate to him. He whines a lot, criticize almost everything and everyone around him, self-absorbed and extremely spoiled. I wonder where's the inspiration that people said they got from reading this book? What part of the book was inspiring? Because I read nothing good nor rational in it. Holden is a good example of a hypocrite.Its good to know that there are people who shares the same opinion as mine.Ps. ""Catcher in the Rye"" was also poorly written."
1715,Precious Garnett,Hated with a passion. I usually like all the books i read but this is the first ever book I've hated. The book was soooo boring and the protagonist was such a whinny little brat!
1716,Jessi Szigethy,I did not like this one bit. I understand it's a classic and that's why I tried but the constant complaining and blaming others turned me off completely. Maybe if I had read it as a teen...
1717,Paul Harmon,"I know Holden Caulfield is an acquired taste or something right? Well forme he is the worst POV character Ive ever read. I despise this book as much as I did 30 years ago.Holden is a terrible, boring character and Salinger repeats the same words and phrases constantly trying to imitate an immature teenager's speech patterns but it made me nuts. As many times as the phrase ""all of the sudden"" was repeated you would have thought something actually happened in the book...spoiler alert...it didn't. Also repeated ad nauseam Too Damn..., I really did, ...and all, Goddam, the trouble with, Madman, Bastard(s), I hate that, Phonies, Lousy, Annoys the hell out me, If you want to know the truth, It's nice, Drives you crazy, ...and stuff, Cigarette, It killed me, for god's sake, I swear, old (someone)i.e (old Phoebe), The thing is, it's depressing, anyway.There, take those words and phrases out of the book and you only need to read half of the book, because that's all thats left.It's no wonder kids grow up hating reading when you give them this self indulgent crap and call it a classic or great literature....It's boring and Jaded and pointless.Here you go, catcher in the Rye by me.Annoying underachieving scared teenager gets kicked out of another rich boy prep-school. He goes to NY city smokes to much, drinks to much, can't get along with girls of any age, and acts like an idiot before going home to see his sister and never really finishes the story since nothing happened anyway.There I just saved you 6 hours of reading make your checks payable to cash please.You want to read a classic read ""To Kill a Mockingbird"". If you want to be numb before committing seppuku read Salinger."
1718,Amythest Smith,I had to read this book in school. It was ok I think I was a little to young to completely get it. It is not a book I would read again.
1719,Aj,Terrible. I don't understand why people recommend this book. The only thought I have is that they hated the book so much that it drove them to inflict pain and suffering onto an other as a way to wash their own way. I am sure there are people who enjoyed it and are perfectly sane people. This book is like art some people will probably enjoy it and have it touch a place deep inside them and some people like me just wont get it. Best of luck
1720,Katie Goodloe,Didn't get it.
1721,Scott,"I read Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye way back in high school in 1997. All I remember is despising it. It was so negative and whiny. I already deal with that in my everyday life at times and don't enjoy it there, so it is not what I want to escape to when I read a book. However, I was only 16 back then, and may have to picker Catcher back up soon to see if my opinions have changed over the years."
1722,Drew Weatherton,"A book about absolutely nothing. At least it had an interesting writing style, but it seemed like I was reading some random blog full of disconnected rambling. I must be missing something."
1723,Charles Robb,"Summary TeaseOur story opens with Holden, a teenage delinquent, being expelled from yet another expensive boarding school. He then travels to New York he both struggles with his sexuality and then later falls in love with a prostitute. Further New York adventures include: getting drunk with nuns, fighting his girlfriend’s pimp, and catching a STD! But all is not well. Holden develops depression and struggles with loneliness in this foreign city and feels that no one is who they appear to be, or “phony”. He visits an old English teacher who imparts life advice amounting to a warning against dying needlessly. Holden then begins to set out west to live as a deaf-mute for the rest of his life. But before he can leave, situations spin out of hand. What is happening? Will he ever stop the phonies? Was J.D. Salinger really responsible for the death of Beatles member John Lenin? Read The Catcher in the Rye to find out.Who might be interested in this book? Why?Those interested in mid fifties “rebel without a cause” books would find this interesting, as would anyone as sadomasochistic enough to want to hear the word “phony” once a page. Those who possess the ability to pull meaning from utter mediocrity and empty writing would also find this book a fantastic read. If a story involving sex with multiple prostitutes and stream of consciousness interests you, this book is your best bet. Mrs. Harper, however, would probably dislike the graphic, and quite frankly disgusting, sex scenes. The violence against women and pimps can also be unsettling at times.Overall SatisfactionThis is, hands down, the worst book ever written. I would not burn it, for fear the terrible contents would vaporize and find some way of strangulating my hippocampus. The meaning many people pull from this dense and incomprehensible heap of words is astounding and only serves to exemplify humanity’s ability to take anything and find meaning. Aside from terrible writing, the story was meaningless and about a rich kid too lazy to do anything with his life, hardly a award winning material."
1724,Lynette Eklund,"Generally, I enjoy dark protagonists, but I didn't find him dark. I found him annoying. I quite simply did not like him. Period. I hated spending time with him, and spent most of the reading trying to get away from him. "
1725,David Gorgone,"I'm sorry, I don't see what the big deal is. I read the book in highschool and didn't care for it. So when I was older I thought maybe becoming more mature would have helped me to appreciate the book more. Nope. Still nothing. I can appreciate what this book did to the literary landscape at the time, but I don't think it's worth all the hype."
1726,Emma Carter,"To be quite honest I thought that this book was rather boring. Now usually if a book is boring I'll stop reading it, but I couldn't ditch this one because I had to read it for class. In the beginning I was excited to read it! But then when I got about five pages in I thought ""Wow, this is so boring,"" and it was. When I have to read a boring book my mind goes elsewhere and I often times forget that I'm even reading something at all, this was the case with this book. Now on the beginning I thought that Holden Caulfield was just a whiny, shallow, depressed loner. But after really understanding that Holden wanted to be the person to help people, I realized that maybe he wasn't as bad as I had thought before maybe he wasn't as whiny and shallow as I had thought before, maybe he just wasn't doing anything with his life that he had wanted. Maybe that was what Salinger thought, maybe he wasn't doing what he wanted with his life. The reason that I didn't think that this book was as good as others is I just thought that it was boring, nothing really appealing to me about it. That's it"
1727,Chad Weiden,Second most over rated classic EVER. Holden...man....stop complaining and jump on the darn carousel. And who walks through a patch of rye anyway? So dumb. 
1728,Jim,If I had put all that cursing in my book it might have been a best seller too. Don't know what people see in this book!
1729,Lara,"Holden Caulfield is a 16 year old that struggles with pretty much everything. He is continually kicked out of private schools because he doesn't apply himself. He claims its because everybody he is surrounded by is phoney. He has a very negative view on life. I'm actually not sure what else the book is about. That was pretty much the whole plot. I kind of hated this book. Even though it was only about 200 pages it took me two days to read it. I didn't want to turn the page and keep going-but determined to finished, I kept going anyways. Holden is a negative teen who wastes money, time and his life. He is strange. Maybe I would have liked it more if it came together more in the ending. But it didn't. "
1730,J.D.,"Why do people consider this a classic? It is torture to read. I had to read it for my adolescent literature class, and it was one of the few in that course I disliked. It's nothing more than 214 pages of listening to a spoiled brat bitch about how everyone around him is a phoney and that life sucks. Holden Caulfield is a foul-mouthed, egotistical, self-absorbed, ungrateful, and whiny jerk. Not the kind of person I want to be around-or read about. Sorry Salinger."
1731,Isla,"This book is over-rated. There have been much better books that comment on the difficulties of being a teenager in an indifferent society. The protagonist was a lifeless shell, that only had a tiny bit of character through his mourning of his dead brother. Maybe if he engaged himself in life, this book would not be the most boring thing I have ever read. He does only represent an excuse to confused teenagers. "
1732,Emth,Sigh.....this book was painful to read at school as a 16 year. I found it irritating to say the least. Get over yourself Holden.Perhaps I should re-read it now as the parent of teenagers? Hmmmm.....might give me some insight!
1733,Rachel Marie,"This is honestly the worst book ive ever read. Its not that i hate classic lit; i LOVED of mice and men, romeo and juliet, and lord of the flies! This just SUCKED"
1734,Angelina,One of the books I detested in high school which I need to re-read and see if I was too young to understand or if I just don't like it.
1735,Marvin,"I didn't like this classic & actually sympathize with those who find it offensive as an assignment for high school students. It's some people's idea of what high school students typically feel, but probably only a few do."
1736,Yanic,"The main reason why I read this book it's because people say it is a classic. Maybe I should have read it when I was 15 or maybe I read a bad translated version, but the fact it's that this book was a waist of time and energy. The main character it's a young playboy who is in crisis because he was kick out from school because he was just too lazy to study. He spent some time in NY, hating everything but his sister and his dead brother. It's an amazing boring and self-centered book and I made a big effort to like the main character but he's just another stupid playboy. "
1737,Jimmy Zhang,this book was soooooo disappointing i found myself lost like confused like what the heck i just read and just stood there looking at it for some hours it wasted my time. it was just about his sad life i dindt get what i was supposed to learn or what i was suppose to teach me. 
1738,Lieve,"I really tried, but Holden and I didn't become friends... I learned to appreciatie him somewhat along the way, but after all it didn't work out. At page 133 I left him in his adolescent world. I guess he'll manage.Update: yesterday I quit this book, and today I couldn't help but start reading it again until I had finished it. Oh well, at least now I am really sure that this isn't the book of the century for me. It did get a little better towards the end though, so I might even give it 2 stars now. Almost. "
1739,Keryl Raist,"I know what many of you are thinking, ""One star? Catcher is work of great literary significance. It's been read and loved over and over. It was a ground breaking moment in literary history, and one of the seminal works in the creation of ""the teenager."" To which I say, sure, but it's boring!See, here's the thing, I wanted to be wrapped in something edgy and dangerous. But I was 14 in 1991, and Holden was written in 1951. So, yes, I am well aware of how edgy and dangerous he was when the book came out, but for those of you who don't remember (or weren't born yet) let me explain more of the culture I was looking to escape into something edgy and dangerous from. Popular TV: Friends was brand new, Seinfield was still on the air, I was a Twin Peaks fanatic, and China Beach was either still on the air or a not too distant memory. Music: At my school kids were listening to Nirvana, which had more disaffected teen angst than Holden and seventeen of his most depressed friends. Kids were still walking around in Guns and Roses T-shirts, some of which had the interior art from the Appetite For Destruction Album on it. (The one with the raped woman in the foreground.) Grunge was just staring to come in, and Pearl Jam was starting to make waves. Basically the upper-middle class world I grew up in was rougher, more sexually charged, more rebellious, and used the sort of language that would have made Holden blush while saying good morning to the parents.If I had had the brains of a mackerel, it would have occurred to me that a book that was on the Extra Credit Reading List for my white-bread high school couldn't have been too shocking. But I was fourteen, so I didn't have the brains of a mackerel, more those of a sardine, so I bought into the banned book hype.Imagine, if you will, the fourteen-year-old version of myself. Though I'm not into grunge, I am into flannel, so I'm wearing jeans and a flannel shirt. My hair is long and pulled into a ponytail. I am laying on my stomach, in bed, trying to force myself to read Catcher. And I'm falling asleep. I keep jerking awake, forcing myself to go on, after all there is supposed to be something shocking, something troubling, something interesting in this book.But I'm not finding it. I'm finding page after droning page of Holden angsting away over how terrible it is to be rich and privileged. I'd put my finger in the book to mark the page, and then skim forward looking for something, anything to justify the hype. Wait, is that it there? Call girl in his room, this could be interesting. What do you mean you just want to talk? What is wrong with you? Skim, skim, skim... Maybe this is it. Alone with creepy teacher who's... petting his hair? That's it?And then, how does this angst-fest all end? In a very modern sort of way, actually. Holden, for all practical purposes, goes to rehab. We read Romeo and Juliet my English class that year, not only was it immensely more edgy, sexual, and rebellious than Catcher in the Rye, it was actually fun to read. "
1740,Le Petit Chat,"This is a book I read when I was younger and revisited now, it is the story of Holden soon after he learns of getting expelled from high school, he decides to hop onto a train and stay in a hotel for a while before going home (the holidays start on Wednesday). *Spoiler:*Here he buys a prostitute"" just to chat"", ends up getting rid of her and gets hit when they $5 fee goes up to $10 and he argues with the pimp, he buys his sister her favourite CD which breaks, he goes drinking with his old school friend and realises he can't stand her by the time the night ends, he goes drinking with 3 ugly women and dances with one of them until they decide to leave, he stays over at his favourite teacher and ends up waking up to him stroking his hair and admiring him...and generally wastes a whole bunch of time while reminiscing and complaining about everything and everyone in between. The story was a quick read and wasn't bad but was not what I would personally call great, I think it has the best effect if you are a teen, once you hit adulthood the character of Holden loses its punch and it ends up feeling like reading a long whiney monologue of a irresponsible 16 year old who seems to care about no one except for his little sister and dead brother. I never found this story amazing even when I read it in my teens and I still don't today. "
1741,Ruha,"When our teacher bought this book for English class and said it was great I thought wooow finally something interesting! But nothing happens. Really. It's boring, annoying... and not funny at all."
1742,Candy,boring
1743,Jaime,What a great book to give teenagers in high school who are enduring the throws of the ageing process (sarcasm). I felt so depressed after reading this book just like the rest of my 11th grade class back in high school. 
1744,Nada A.,"I have yet to read something as annoying as this book. I mean, I understand movies being annoying, people's voices being annoying, their faces, but this BOOK.. This book annoyed me with every repetition of the word ""phony""; with every mention of the boy's poor, unsupported, very almost-disgusting personality... I CRINGE when I think of this book. I hate it beyond words. That being said, I do see the point Salinger was trying to make, I do understand a lot of the situations he described, a lot of the thoughts that went through the boy's head, but I honestly think that he could have written it in a way that doesn't try as hard to provoke the reader, or to be ""outspoken"" or whatever. I cannot actually believe I wasted my time reading this. I kept hoping for a twist that'll make it all worth it. Silly me. "
1745,ara133photography,"I tried... I tried to like this - so many people do, but I just hated every second. I had to read it for school, so I did finish it, but I despised just about everything about this book!"
1746,Laura Spaulding,I hated this book. Most people tend to like it. I felt like i had wasted 2 hours of my life reading about a whinny rich boy.
1747,Charlotte,"I know the allure of this book for most is the characteristic 'blandness', but I found Catcher in the Rye to be incredibly cumbersome at the best of times.."
1748,Bombito Erickson,"If you're a trash digger and want to find some high quality garbage, go read The Catcher in the Rye. I had no interest in this book at all. The only good thing you get out of it is the message it gives off. But that wont be described because of spoilers. The book is about a boy named Holden that walks around New York City, Absolutely trashing everything he sees, explains why the book is such trash. But before he even gets there he gets kicked out of school because him and a room mate get in a fight. Did I mention he hates school too?!(not like we all hate it anyways). The only person he likes in the entire book is his sister. Id compare this book to animal farm because it is as bad if not worse than animal farm was, both the messages were put in such bad ways of both of these books. And I would recommend The catcher in the Rye to people that like the really older garbage books or books that are just simply taken place in the fifties time era. "
1749,Asma,"I finished this book in one day. I kept on turning each page thinking: ""ok something will happen now"", but guess what? Nothing happens. It's just our character, Holden, talking nonsense throughout the book. There was nothing interesting about his personality. I don't mind reading books without an interesting plot but at least the characters need to be interesting. This book drags on and on about Holden's pointless thoughts. It's infuriating, really. I didn't enjoy anything about him. The book is literally all about Holden calling people from his school and having a drink with them. Would not recommend!!!!!"
1750,ryan,"This book is terribly overblown tripe with only one moving passage, where the protagonist explains himself, giving meaning to the title of the book. Overblown to the extreme."
1751,Anna Bear,"Why this book is a classic really has always blown my mind. I thought it was a poor excuse for story telling from page one, but i kept going and found out in the end that it was just as bad all the way to the last page."
1752,Elena Nuñez,I`m sure Rose won`t agree with me.. She made me read it long time ago...This book didn`t call my attention. I found it boring. Maybe I should give it a second chance.. 
1753,❀Aimee❀ Just one more page...,"Admittedly, the ""classics"" often befuddle me. Maybe you have to be part of the generation in which the classic was written to appreciate it.I remember reading this in high school out of curiosity and just not being impressed at all. I don't care about any of the things that made it ""banned""...I just wasn't interested in what it was selling.I've recently reread the plot summary and other information about it on wikipedia and I'm still at a loss.There are a few books that I felt readers alone ascribed deep, poignant truths to and the writer went along with it. While there may have been intentional points made in this book (I mean it IS Salinger), I sometimes wondered if authors had a ploy. When my teachers were telling me about the symbolism I wish I could talk to the author and see if that was really what they intended. Author thinks to self: Hmmm... I don't know exactly what points I want to make, but if I write with a lot of detail and description and make it superlong....someone is bound to find some symbolism!I did in fact use this ploy in high school when we were supposed to write a deeply symbolic paper. ARG. So I wrote a story, made sure the surrounding environment of the story created a ""mood"" and got an A.This is not to say that there weren't plenty of truly symbolic/ metaphorical classics that were great. And again, perhaps one has to be living in the generation some classics were written in to really appreciate them.
What ""classic(s)"" do you wish you'd never read?
"
1754,Ryan Mishap,"My junior high school teacher suggested I read this after we had an argument about cursing in stories. I didn't bother until a couple years later and I hated this book. I remember thinking: shit, did she think I was like this guy? Boy did she read me wrong.Anyway, stupid book."
1755,Rajdeep,"Huge let-down...the only words I found in nearly every page were: 'phony', 'goddam', 'bastard', 'old Phoebe', 'killing me', 'fuck you'...wouldn't recommend it :\"
1756,Austin Chan,At first I thought I didn't understand the novel because it was so angsty and I hated the main character. Then I realized that it's supposed to be angsty and the character is supposed to kind of seem like a douchebag. Now I hate it even more. 
1757,Daniel Munro,"There is a chain type of person who thinks this is a great book, you know who you are."
1758,Anne,"As Mark Twain said, ""A classic is something everyone wants to have read, but nobody wants to read."" Holden Caulfield needs to have sense knocked into him."
1759,Marisa,"I never liked this book. I couldn't stand the constant ""everyone is a phony"" attitude. I don't think I really understood it. One of my husband's favorites though. Deserves another chance someday..."
1760,Alaa," It's an odd feeling disliking a book that everybody loves and praises reverently. It feels like you're missing out on something.  Clearly, I didn't like The Catcher in The Rye. After the first few pages, I thought perhaps it gets better. I trudged along for 148 pages before I stopped, wishing I had sooner. I read the summary on wikipedia to know what happens in the end, though.  It's a book in first person, told by Haulden Caulfield, a teenager who spends two nights basically drunk, lonely and depressed while doing stupid shit like hiring a prostitute and being punched by her pimp. He rambles on and on about what bothers him in life in an entire page and that gets back to the main point with ""Anyway..."". His narration is lousy and his style is annoying. A lot of ""Chrissake"", ""goddamn"", ""boy"". He is cynical, hates everything and is critical of everyone. Overall, very annoying, very immature, very stupid. I get it, he's a teenager, all of them are like that, they speak like that (in 1950s America), his cynicism is directed towards himself. But, the problem with a book without much of a plot but only the character speaking, is if you dislike the character, you dislike the book.  Genuinely disappointed since I've heard so much about it."
1761,Mounik,"I don't get it. What's so great about this book again? I found nothing really worthy of reviewing except to make a note to myself to never read it again. Maybe it was just the hype that it didn't live up to. Or maybe, this book just sucks.It was repetitive, scatterbrained, and not nearly as interesting as I thought it would be. Holden might have had some very justified views of society and its people, but would I care to keep his company and talk to him about these things? No, thanks. Reading the dialogue was enough to leave me thoroughly annoyed with him. In fact, I found Holden and his random interactions with others (random because some didn't really fit with where the story was going at all) pretty annoying most of the time. Other than Holden's connection to his younger sister, the book lacked character development, plot, climax, emotion, everything! The only thing keeping me up late into the night reading it was waiting for something good to happen...and waiting...and waiting...and then falling asleep from boredom because it never did. Finally got through it and scratching it off my list of classics to-read (to never be read again)."
1762,Jessica," I get why people like this book, and I can see why teens especially boys can relate to it. I just found Holden really annoying. "
1763,Allie_hinton," I kinda liked the book but it took to long to get to the point and it was soo hard to get focused on which made me bored so my over all rating for this book is one star. Holden was just very rude and mean and really didnt care what people though of him , which is not a bad thing, he also always got himself into things that didnt have to happen. i would not recommend this book to anyone because its not worth time to read. This book was very boring and a waste of my time."
1764,Jeanine,"Good grief, I remember being forced to read this long ago...I hated it then and still can't get into it today. I've heard many people talk about how this book transformed them as a teenager but I just don't see what they do in this book. I tried it as a kid and again as an adult...I thought it was trash both times, sorry."
1765,Kristin,"This was the moment as a Senior in High School, I realized that I was super straight laced. Holden Caulfield would have hated me as a classmate which is perfectly fine with me because I hated him! However, it gets two stars because it did make me realize it takes all kinds and I would encounter all kinds at college."
1766,Olivia,"The fact that there is an option to ""hide because of spoilers"" is amusing. Nothing happens in this book, the plot is monotonous with absolutely no climax and the book itself spoils the reading. I finished reading this last night for school and I could not be more disappointed. This book is so so so so so overrated. I started reading it enthusiastic because I heard it was such an important classic and such a good book. Wrong. Don't read it."
1767,Ling,I did not like it. This plot was slow and there was not exciting scenes in there.
1768,Randall,"Normally, I wouldn't pick just random book to rate and review, but this was on the list of the most popular books. I think I read this at the wrong time in my life, which was not until college. Sure, I could relate in sort of a relative way, but I was beyond the period of life the book's about. Maybe if I'd read it a few years earlier, I would've gotten more out of it. Also, I'm a little frustrated you can't give 1 and 1/2 stars."
1769,Janel,"This book just goes on and on. No climax, no real progression. Poor kid just suffers from depression the whole time. There was some humor in a teenager and stuff they do, see and feel, but overall I found it a little boring. "
1770,Ronny,"This book seemed to be page after page of the ""protagonist"" rambling. It was emotionally draining and a chore.However, if the purpose of the book was to show us what it was like to associate with such a person, then it succeeded admirably."
1771,Chris Lightfoot,"Following fairly high expectations, I didn't enjoy this at all. I didn't like Holden at all. An irritating, petulant individual. The storyline is weak; I could summarise what happened in a couple of sentences. A few hours of my life I won't get back... "
1772,Lyndsay,"I read the whole thing because I wanted to be able to form a wholly honest opinion about this book. That being said, the time it took me to do so is about 5 hours of my life I will never get back."
1773,Lauren W,i would give it negative 5 stars if it were possible worst thing i ever read if it wasnt for school i would have stopped reading it by now
1774,Laetitia Red,I don't know why this book has so fame. It's a boring story. There is no storyline. 
1775, Dr. Michael Galvin,Perhaps the most overrated book since the Bible. Halden Caulfield is such an annoying little fuck I wanted to punch him in the head. How's that for a literary review?
1776,Jennifer,Really did not like this---it was basically just the main character whining about everything for over 200 pages. 
1777,Isiah Velasquez,"The most overrated novel of all-time. Only reason I finished it was because I was already 100 pages in when I realized how terrible it was. To be fair, it's probably a book for someone who's at a younger, more vulnerable stage in their life."
1778,Kermit,"Not really even 1 star. More like half a star. I really hated this book.I first read this book about a zillion years ago. The only thing that I could remember about it was that Holden wonders where the ducks in Central Park go in the wintertime.I like ducks. So I recently re-read this book because it's supposedly an icon of young adult literature. I know the rest of the world loves this book. I know that many consider it to be the ultimate ""coming of age"" tale. But I didn't see that much character development in Holden. His affection for his sister, Phoebe, is admirable, and his interactions with her do seem to give him a few insights into his mostly miserable, floundering, and very pitiful life. But the book was a disaster for me. I'm not embarrassed to say that I'm not cool or sophisticated enough to like this book. I'm also not cool enough to see the allure of the reclusive and recently dead J.D. Salinger. He seems creepy to me."
1779,Blake,"The Catcher in the Rye is about some phony named Holden Caulfield. He goes around talking to kids and trying to give girls the time. That kills me. And he always talks about his dead brother and how great his goddam sister is and all. I think he's some big phony. He's always talking about how annoying everyone else is ...and how he wants to save kids and run away to live in the goddam woods, but he does the same thing everyone else does. I get quite a bang out of that. He'll probably be the kind of guy who always talks about how many miles he gets in his goddam car. What a phony. He's probably flitty. I mean he can never get really sexy with a girl. You know, really sexy. I can be very sexy sometimes. Women kill me. Anyway, he really drove me crazy while I was reading all about him, but after a while I started to miss him. You know, how when you have to shoot the crap with some phony about how they want to run off and live in the woods, and they just keep talking the whole goddam time."
1780,Robert,"I don't remember who was ""pitching"" and who was ""catching"" but I do remember that the Cliff's Notes had very little to do with Mr. Burtness' test."
1781,Kirt,"The only thing I liked about this book was wondering how people could like this book. Some I think can identify with the main character because their teenage years were similar. I think all of us go through those moments of self doubt and cynicism and frustration with the world and all its ""phonies"". But this is so over the top. The kid whines about all the phonies in the world but ends up being a phony himself. While I was reading I just keep thinking SHUT UP! It was hard being in his head and listening to the whining. I kept waiting for him to have some redeeming qualities, and he does care about others to a degree, but I couldn't take anymore of the whining and couldn't make it to the end of the book. From what I understand it doesn't get any better from there."
1782,Nancy Mullins,"I thought it was very difficult to get thru. maybe if I would have read it 30 years ago, I could have found it more relevent."
1783,Nick,"what a downer. I couldn't get past 2 or 3 chapters. Yes, I'm sure there's all kinds of literary criticisms to be made of this book that just went right over my head but I really don't care. It's the diary of a loser. No thanks."
1784,Russ Johnson,"Having just read this again for the first time since high school, I can say that however implausible, I like it even less at age 35. I read it again to try and gain insight as to why so many with a predestination for tragedy use it as a springboard. Having gotten to know several ""millennials"" (or were they just hipsters, lol) since my first read, I do see some scary similarities. Perhaps my favorite item about the book that I found in an analysis online is:""A “caul” is a membrane that covers the head of a fetus during birth. Thus, the caul in his name may symbolize the blindness of childhood or the inability of the child to see the complexity of the adult world. Holden’s full name might be read as Hold-on Caul-field: he wants to hold on to what he sees as his innocence, which is really his blindness."""
1785,Kira,"Now it might just be that I have poor taste in books, but Holden Caulfield joins Hamlet at the top of the list of literary characters I would dearly like to punch in the throat."
1786,Gordon Bonnet,I just don't get why so many people seem to love this book. I thought Holden Caulfield was a whiny twit -- not someone I wanted to spend my time reading about.
1787,Caitlyn,"While is it, respectably, an American classic, I fail to see both the eloquence and the significance of this particular piece of literature. In my entire life, never have I found a book so difficult to get through (with the one exception, perhaps, of ""Rebecca"" by Daphne du Maurier). And it is not for lack of trying. I sought to enjoy it as any other classic, and as Salinger's prose is not complicated and the book slight in size, it did not seem such a sizeable task. I was very much mistaken. I spent all 100-odd pages of this detestable work in sheer anguish, rolling my eyes and lurching on the inside to set the book on fire and chuck it as far from me as possible. While the writing style and connection to reality is respectable, Salinger, in an attempt no doubt to create the epitome of a ""cynical adolescent"", has birthed a monstrosity worthy to be used as capital punishment. In short, with all the benefit of the doubt credited to his name, J.D. Salinger's ""The Catcher in the Rye"" is merely one hundred odd pages of a sardonic teenager bitching about his life. I am a firm antagonist of any and all shortcuts in the literature field, but even I say you ought to SparkNote this one: you will miss nothing."
1788,Kiley Reed,I hated this book. I really don't know how it became such an iconic piece of literature. It really had no redeeming qualities that I could find.
1789,Caeligh,I read this for school and I think that there is no plot whatsoever. Holden Caulfield dislikes everything and thinks everyone is a phony. There's no interesting things that happen and the ending is bizarre.
1790,Dray,I do NOT see the appeal of this book. I thought it was whiny and dull.
1791,Organicearthful,"You only have to watch 1 hour of reality tv programming to get the sense of futile and frustrating, hypocrisy and angst ridden moronic banality this book set out to portray. Since most everyone will have had a reality tv experience there is less need to read this book nowadays, unless of course that's what turns you on. I just burnt my copy on the fire an equally meaningless gesture, none the less curiously satisfying. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAsd_..."
1792,T Sunclades,I did not grow up as a petulant spoiled child so I did not identify with Holden in any way. To me he was an insufferable brat and it made the novel almost unreadable. 
1793,Monty Wildhack,"""*profuse sobbing*""--J.D. Salinger."
1794,Mia,"I really really hated this book. I will admit there might be some merit in studying it and what it says about the decade it was published in, but I couldn't stand it.First, the over descriptive almost stream of consciousness writing style drove me nuts. How many times do you have to talk about a guys spots before I throw up?Then there's Caulfield himself, a boy who is so full of privilege there isn't room for anything else...except for all of his many judgments. I mean seriously, he squanders every single magnificent opportunity given to him while passing judgement on everyone else in his life. Oh, and the overuse of the word phony. It was like watching those kids standing outside of Hot Topic calling everyone who enters a poseur. Please just stop. Then we get the ending with no explanations or revelations other than he ""might"" try to apply himself when he goes back to school. Even if he does I wouldn't know why. There's nothing in the text to show he's changed or grown except that statement.No, Catcher in the Rye is definitely not for me. /rant (I think I hated this guy more than I hated Hamlet. Now that's an accomplishment.) "
1795,Zekses,Had to read this during our school`s American literature course. Hated the thing with a passion. Main hero is a depressive jerk and I can`t find a single reason anyone would want to read about him... strangely enough it`s considered classics >_<
1796,Katherine,i know its a classic but couldnt get into it. my brothers ab fav. holden whines and is an unappealing character to me
1797,Jadwiga,"Do samego końca miałam nadzieję, że w końcu coś zacznie się dziać i bohater dojdzie do sedna swojej historii. Jednak bachor nie ma nic ciekawego do powiedzenia. Zmarnował mi tylko kilka godzin życia."
1798,Rhiannon,"This book was okay I only finished it because it was quite short so I thought I might as well. I was very glad when I saw that I had finally reached 99%! It was written in a very relaxed manner which added to the authenticity but nothing of interest happened, it dragged in parts and in others it made me feeling sorry for Holden as he is so lonely. I have a degree in English Lit and I know it is considered a classic and all but I just don't understand why no matter how much I try to analyse it. Quite a disappointment. "
1799,Amber Mccune,"I read this book in high school and hated it. I just had to re-read it for a Young Adult Literature class and still hated it. I know it is supposed to be the first Young Adult literature novel and a classic, but only Lord of the Flies goes up there with this book in my most hated list. "
1800,The Potholes,"Before I read the book, based on what I heard from others, I put the book on a pedestal. I referenced to it all the time and thought to myself, the day I finally read the book, will be the day my entire perspective on life will change. Boy, was I ever wrong. This book disappointed me more than any other. It left me regretting the moment I borrowed it and opened the book. Honestly I wish I had never read it and gone on with my life pretending that it was the best book in the world.I can not stress enough on how pretentious I thought the narrator, the writer and the entire book was. Nor can I comprehend how anyone could like it.I can see why it was relatable but that was the only positive of the book. Also this meant that the book could only be enjoyed by those who could relate to the feelings of the book. An angsty teen as the narrator? Yeah, a lot of people have felt that way towards life and studies especially at that age, so I can see how people would relate to it. But, I still didn’t like how he was portrayed.From what I read the author was trying to showcase an everyday situation and tried to make it more interesting and meaningful but the plot lacked the interesting twists that leave me wanting to read more. Also, it may just be the writing style, or just the book in general, but it seemed like the narrator had very little to say, which was odd..Each plot line felt like the author had 20 ideas and penned them down to form a non cohesive book that just feels thrown together and lazy.The narrator was so passive, and it kind of freaked me out. He was dull throughout the story; even when he was talking of his younger brother’s death (which was admittedly my favorite part), it felt as if he had no connection to this event or to the character itself (it’s your brother, please for the love of god show some emotion).My distaste for this very dry book may be because I don’t relate to the book. I don’t like the fact that the entire book was so materialistic (his ideas of happiness) and useless. Quoting my english teacher, “Your story should have a moral”; this book didn’t teach me anything. It didn’t inspire me nor this it invoke any feelings. I don’t understand how people understood the “true meaning of the book”. I can not stress enough on how pretentious I thought the narrator, the writer and the entire book was. Nor can I comprehend how anyone could like it.In the end it took me way too long to finish it and even more to form this review. This lead me to find out how many other people disliked the book, which was surprisingly not a lot. Most of the reviews were filled with how the book changed their life or how when they first read it they didn’t like it but now after twenty years they love and understand it.Maybe, if I read it when I’m older I might like it and see it in a different perspective but for now I don’t think it was that great of a book.~kalonFor more reviews like this one (and some not like this one), check out our blog at:  almostelysian.wordpress.com "
1801,Kathy  Petersen,"When I read this as an assignment in high school, my response was ""stop whining and grown up!"" These many decades later I feel rather much the same. The grammar is excretable, the sentence structure boringly repetitive, and the characters shallow and unlikable (except maybe Phoebe).However, I persisted and was much taken with Franny and Zooey, Nine Stories, and even Raise High the Roofbeams.... It's just Holden and his pathetic story that I decry."
1802,Darcey," As I was in Grade 12 - so I am I over 10 years later. I am remarkably and wholly unimpressed by Salinger's writing, a protagonist I cannot relate with and find utterly worthless. I decided to read Catcher in the Rye again to see if my perspective may have changed in a decade, but I find that it has not: perhaps with more experienced eyes for literary analysis, I find this book even more trite, poorly written, and the protagonist even more unlikeable and unable to empathise with. He is no 'likeable but misunderstood' character, the sort I can look back on and say 'Ah, yes - that's what I felt like as a teenager!'. I read it through, just to say I had given it a fair shot with time and not being forced to read in a school environment, and I can say that my feelings have only changed in that I cannot even find it in myself to muster loathing for this book, for it's not worth my time so much as to even garner that much emotional investment."
1803,Claire,"Holden was just really whiney, and he was a liar. i did not connect with him at all and he bothered me. it was tough to read"
1804,Mandalou loves kevin,Had to read in school yet dont know why. It is hard to follow but I pushed my way through and the most twisted ending I have ever read in my life and I have read a lot.
1805,Ernest Martin,"Love this book when I read it in high school. Obviously I have changed :) or this book did not carry well over the years as in reading it 40 years later, I hated it, a struggle to get through it. It is just the same story from scene to scene, saying the same stuff over and over again with no point to it."
1806,Surfing Moose,I can't figure out why a certain group of people (who might be unbalanced) when caught by the authorities (for whatever reason) have a copy of this book (on their person) or have purchased many copies of it.Holden is a piece of work and very unlikeable.After finishing it I actually tossed my copy into the trash.
1807,David Brown,"Highly overrated book. I don't understand why this book has such a large following. Holden isn't a rebel as is often claimed, he is actually a self absorbed spoiled brat who thinks most everyone else in the book is a ""phony"" or not worth his time. The book is not even structurally artistic and lacks merit. Just a long ramble from a disturbed, unlikeable narrator. The excessive use of trite phrases does nothing to add to the appeal.The only redeeming trait of the narrator is that he wants to be the catcher in the rye, i.e. saving children from falling out of innocence into the perils of adulthood. However, from how the narrator is presented in the novel, one senses that he would think the falling child would either be too phony or unimportant to bother saving."
1808,Guy,I'm probably the only person in the world who hated this book. I don't understand what everyone loves about this book. 
1809,Sahar Uzumaki,"Had to study this novel for GCSE English. Couldn't stand the book, couldn't stand the main character. I just...couldn't stand it."
1810,Rickey Laurentiis,"Everyone calls it a mastery. It may very well may be. When I read it, I thought it was entirely oversexed and overrated."
1811,Estonia,"Finally finished this one. Whew...it was tough to get through. If it were longer I don't think I would have finished it. I don't truly understand why this book is considered a 20th century American classic. The main character, Holden Caulfield, is definitely flawed but not interesting enough for me to care. I kept waiting for the moment in the book where everything begins to make sense and that never happened. I was reading and thinking, ""What is the point? Why am I suppose to care? And I don't like you Holden.""Perhaps it is a gender gap. I've read several reviews by males for this book and they adore it. They find that it speaks to them and has a great voice about youth in the 1950s. However, I discussed it with a some friends and they hate it for the same reasons I did. It has a character that is an asshole and has no true ambition in life even though he believes that he does.So in conclusion, I do not recommend this book. And if it is on your mandatory school reading list, I'm sorry."
1812,Tiff,I don't know why everyone loves this book so much. I really couldn't stand it. Holden annoyed the hell out of me.
1813,Kimberly Turner,"The Catcher in the Rye is a must-read book. It will certainly evoke strong feelings in the reader. I, however, just did not like the story. That does not mean that I wouldn't suggest it. The Catcher in the Rye is a book where you either love it or you hate it. I just happened to hate it. "
1814,Haley R.,"I expected so much out of this book but was greatly disappointed. Holden, in my opinion, is very conceited and hates pretty much everything. I wouldn't recommend this."
1815,Za H Ra,هیچ نتیجه گیری خاصی ندارهنمی دونم چرا انقدر طرفدار داره؟!؟فقط تا وسطهای کتاب شخصیت داستان برات جالبه ، که اون هم خسته کننده میشه و تکراری
1816,Nevada,Holden Caulfield is a jerk and a whiner.
1817,Nicole,"Well, here comes a rant...Read this for English class. Probably the worst book ever. Holden is whiny and pessimistic. I couldn't stand him. Hes a complete idiot...."
1818,Mary Anne,"This book is very curious. It was published in the 50's when psychological ramblings, particularly of an adolescent, were a novelty. It takes place over 3 days depicting the boy's soulsearching for his inner self. The denouement comes in the last line of the penultimate chapter: ""God, I wish you could've been there."" The boy Houldin has been depressed by the death of one brother and the departure for Hollywood of the other. He is left having to be the older brother of a young sister with no role models left. It is obvious he feels that he is a disappointment to his parents, his sister, to everyone he knows.There is no resolution, no hope, only an alusion to when he recovers from this illness (apparently a breakdown) and returns to his life at yet another school."
1819,Cate,"I really hated this book (I think that's the first time I've ever said that about a book!). I thought about stopping reading it multiple times, but since it's a ""staple"" in American literature, I figured I would stick it out until the end. There was really no true plot to the book and the character constantly got on my nerves. I wouldn't recommend this book. "
1820,Kathleen,"The only reason why I give this even 1 star is because it makes it obvious that I have read it and reviewed it. This is the worst book I have ever read!!! There is a difference between apathy and hatred. There are many many books I have read and not liked in an apathetic sort of way. Not The Catcher in the Rye, I hated this book with a passion!"
1821,Richard Beasley,"Actually 0/100 (or even 1000).I probably need to reread it, because is have never been so bored by a book. There is nothing even to dislike - I just did not get the point at all. No idea what all the fuss is about, or how it (apparently) contributed to the madness that led to assassination of John Lennon (for becoming phony). Just do not get it at all - usually when I hate a book I can at least see what others see in it, or even love (I know it takes all sorts, and otherwise it would be so so boring). This I seen nothing at all. So as I say, I'll read a range of reviews, be in a place when I can concentrate, and try and again."
1822,Amy Zarn,"I did not enjoy this book. It was my first time reading it and I had a very difficult time relating to anyone in the story - except maybe Phoebe and it was too close to the end of the book to ""save"" it. The book felt very dark and sad (I guess that was the intention) but I also felt alot of ire towards the little dumb ass main character. What a waste he was making of his life. I know that his brother's death was certainly affecting his behavior and I think his father's money didn't help, either. I can see the messages that were presented here, but I didn't enjoy reading it. One of those books where I couldn't wait to be done with it and had to force myself to finish reading. "
1823,Molly,I reaaaally didnt like this book. Holden kept rambling on for pages about what could have been said in a few words. He also said the word phony too often.
1824,Adam K,An American classic. Rubbish for anyone else! 
1825,Vaishali Joglekar,Meh ... Holden's a whiny jerk. And I'm not alone in what many readers feel is perhaps English literature's most overrated book: https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/... https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/...
1826,Colette Nicholl,I've tried to read this book several times over the last 30 years and just cannot get into it. I haven't even made if halfway. 
1827,Jonathan Harris,This is the only book that I've ever read in it's entirety and hated through every page.
1828,Jessica Bass,"0-316-76948-7 	While this book is lauded by literary critics for it's insight into the angst-filled teenage mind, I find it very difficult to read. The book has no plot and reads like one long rambling monologue that seemingly has no purpose. Additionally, while I have no problem with swear words and vulgar language, this book is overfilled with more than it's share. You can't read one page without coming across the word goddamn. I found myself loathing this book from the second chapter. I had to force myself to finish it just to see if it ever got any better. It didn't, at least not in my opinion."
1829,Nathan,"Other than as a technical study in skaz, can someone explain to me the appeal of this book? Someone older than fourteen, please."
1830,Jose F. ,"To the NOT-WORTH-TO-BE-FINISHED shelf with it! Great disappointment. Gave it THREE chances, didn't hook me. Didn't like the characters, didn't like the 'plot' (!), didn't like the language, kept thinking ""is this the great Salinger everybody talks so greatly about?"" I'm a third into it, it's clearly not worth my time."
1831,Joel,"All these other reviews are goddamm phoney, if you wanna know the truth. This book is crap, dribble, classic my arse.You will hate it and it will piss you off. But maybe that's the point."
1832,Nina Alexander,The most stupid book I have read my entire life... Wish I could get the time spent on it back...
1833,Zandt McCue,"The Catcher in the Rye is the perfect book for high school students because you always have the kids who read the book and then relate to Holden 100%, not realizing his incredible flaws and immaturity. He becomes idol worshiped as a character when in reality he's just a whiny kid. And to all high school teachers...The question about ducks flying south....it's a question. It doesn't *have* to be symbolic of innocence. It could just be a curious kid asking a question. *internal grr*"
1834,حنين خطاب,وقعت عن طيب خاطر في مكب للتفاصيل....كل تفصيلة كانت أو لا تكون كانت تحت نظر هذا الكاتب بعدسة مكبرةوكان يلو عنق القارىء ليتابع رؤيته للتفاصيل..!ما قد يغفر له إنه كف عن الكتابة بعد هذه الروايةوذهب إلى حيث كان يتمنى بطل قصته...وحقيقة استغرب كيف لإنسان أن يتنبه لسفاسف الأمور...بهذه الطريقة ولا يصيبه السأم والسقم..!وربما الكارثة ليست في محتوى الرواية لكن في طريقة تناولها... كان يجب أن يكون أعمق من هذافبدلا من كل ذلك الركام الوصفي متكتلا....كان عليه أن يضف عليه بعض من روح الشخوص ومشاعرهمربما حينها أختلفت في وقعها على القارىءقتلني هذا الكاتب...ببطأ...!!!!
1835,Bailey Lasseigne,"Most awful book I have read in a while. If I wasn't forced to read the book for school then I would have stopped in the first twenty pages. I don't see the point or plot to this book at all. I have even went on Spark to see the meaning behind everything, but there is none. All it is, is a boy, who is very rude and has problems. The book is over the course of a couple days and during those days nothing important happened. Nothing interesting occurred. I would have rather read the story of his time in the mental institution then the couple of days before. "
1836,Venus Smurf,"I'm not a fan of J.D. Salinger. I can appreciate his writing style, but it still makes me want to beat my head against a brick wall. I also never like his characters. They're depressing and immature, and if every teenager was really like that, the human race would have been wiped out through suicide. PASS."
1837,Nada Ismail,I could barely get through half of the book and then I gave up. Although the idea of the book is brilliant the lack of any plot and the monotonous tone of the book ruined it all. 
1838,mythicgeek,"I read this in high school and I was not a fan. Honestly it came across to me as a rich white boy having rich white boy problems, and that is not something I can ever identify with. All I clearly remember is complaining about such trivial problems in comparison to what other people have suffered. The only thing that stood out was the rebelliousness of the book itself. Having been a banned book full of cursing, it was initially enticing, especially to a girl in Catholic school, but it ultimately fell incredibly short."
1839,Makayla,"I had to read Catcher in the Rye for my English class in grade 9 and it was one of the most boring books I had ever read! It was a struggle not to just go over to Sparknotes and read the summaries. The books seems more like a bunch of pointless rambling. It doesn’t have a great plot and Holden (the main character) just complains about phoney in the world when he’s the biggest phoney there is! However, in it’s own uninteresting way, the book does cover the idea of not wanting to grow up and is definitely a coming of age story."
1840,Mariana Russel,"I... this is NOT what I expected at all. I can't even.... WHAT? From what all the adults have told me I was under the impression that Holden was some sort of hero and this book was somehow meaningful... but what in the world WAS THAT? I'm sorry, I wanted to like this book... but I got to chapter 11 and realized it wasn't at all what I thought it was supposed to be. I decided to finish it, because maybe Holden would stop and actually think; he might do something to improve his life instead of just complaining about it. I thought he might get some sense, but nope. He kept being a boring, whiny, hypocritical, altogether grand phony. It was hard to get through, because Holden or some other character said ""goddamn"" at least once a paragraph and spent whole pages talking about how his dead brother liked to write poems on his baseball glove or how crazy drunk he was... and he keeps talking about how he misses ""old Jane"" and wants to ""give old Jane a buzz"", but he NEVER. CALLS. HER! EVER! That was irritating. I hated the writing style. Is ""old"" Holden's favorite word? ""Old Sally,"" ""old Phoebe,"" ""old Allie,"" ""old Spencer,"" ""old Stradlater""... I've already mentioned overuse of the word ""goddamn""... the dated 40's slang (okay, the book was published in 1951, I'll give it that). The sentence fragments. ""Strictly for the birds,"" ""If that many,"" ""Or if they just flew away"", etc., are not complete sentences. Yet Holden claims that English is his best subject, the only one he didn't fail. The worst part is probably his constant complaining... complaining about women, complaining about not being able to drink because he's a ""goddamn minor"", complaining about the movies, complaining about ""phonies"" (even though he IS one himself), complaining about anything he can think of!! He's self-absorbed and overdeveloped, to the point that he himself doesn't even seen plausible! Like he couldn't even be a real person, he has no actual depth! All Holden ever does is whine and whine and whine and it's irritating and I hate the writing style... I don't understand why some adults I know talk about this book like it's amazing and like Holden Caulfield is the Jesus Christ of fictional characters. I only read this book because they told me it was great, and when I realized I hated it, I only read it to read it.tl;dr I hate it and going in with the expectations I had only made it worse. I cannot stand the character of Holden Caulfield. Sorry for all of my ranting, but I just am so angry now."
1841,Priyanka Korde,"That just kills me. Holden and Salinger together just killed my idea of liking the book. Well, here is the truth. I did not like it one bit. I found it so overrated and all...oh the goddamn narrative is getting to me. I understand the literary and psychoanalytical context and the time when the book came out it was so legendary and probably reading it in my late-twenties, instead of the mid-to- late teens made the difference. I do get it that Holden Caulfield is supposed to be annoying the hell out of the readers and all (there I go again)! He is in this phase of life and all teenagers go through that (I just cannot recollect mine, I was just too busy being a happy kid). However, I found the reading utterly boring and tedious. I liked some parts like the relationship Holden shares with Phoebe. The portrayal of the teenage mind and its workings is interesting. I had heard so much about this book being an American legend and the controversies attached to it, I was too excited about reading the book. But I am just royally disappointed I didn't like it all! Sigh. Like Holden now I'm depressed."
1842,Lexie Cheong,"Not my cup of tea. I can vaguely see the numerous issues that one can explore in the text, but if this wasn't assigned as a compulsory reading item, I would have abandoned it. That's not to say that it's bad writing. I think what really happened for me was that I hated the spirit of the book. Salinger had tried to capture the mindset of a certain type of personality/issue in his writing, and he has succeeded. It is that particular personality/issue that I dislike, I believe. Will need to read more of Salinger to determine that, however. Still, reiterating my earlier claim: not my type of book even if it is in the list of '100 Books to Read Before You Die'. "
1843,Nicole Cichon,I think this book was really boring. They call this book a classic but i dont think that classic should mean really dull. the book takes place over a period of a few days after the main character Holden Caulfield gets kicked out of his third prep school. nothing really happens at all in this book and even the things that happen that should be interesting are really boring in this book. I just found him really frustrating because he had a really fincky personlaity and a strong case of depression and ADD which is often a cool thing but in his case it is a realyl bad thing.
1844,Harry Chong,"Catcher in the Rye as an observation on teenagers is spot on. However, as novel, it is lackluster, placid, and highly annoying. Hardly anything happens in it, and additionally we are forced to follow around an irritating, insecure, dull witted, over-privileged character. The only reason people like this book is because they have not given it a thorough rereading as an adult. Their feelings for it are based purely on nostalgia. Because hey, Catcher in the Rye was probably the first novel you read as a teen, in high school, which had a teenaged protagonist. And you, being a teenager, were probably excited to read a book, finally, about someone like you, despite all his irksome character traits, and lack of plot.I'm guessing the majority of people who enjoyed Catch in the Rye are either teenagers or remembering the times when they were teenagers. Ah, yes, good old memories. You just lump them in all together and give it plenty of high ratings.But as a sane adult, when you read Catcher in the Rye, you just wanna smack Holden Caulfield in the face, and tell him to stop being an dumbass."
1845,Ty Parsons,"One hundred or so pages of the whinging ramblings. The intensity and the confusion is way too high, and although there were a few interesting points, I honestly couldn't wait for it to end."
1846,Kris,"The way I see it, there is a very polarised reception to this book. You either love it or you hate it. I'm not a fan. I think the main character is spoiled and pedantic and I felt nothing, certainly not empathy. But that's just me. You read it and see for yourself."
1847,Ryan Pimentel,"Poorly written, downright boring, and incredibly repetitive - why it has such a massive, rabid following remains a mystery to me."
1848,Aya,"The catcher in the rye. It's a very popular book and I always hear it often being mentioned and recommended by booksellers at the bookstore. I happened to have to read this book for my lecture and I was also curious as to what is so interesting about the book, therefore I bought it. The first thing that came in to my mind was that the book had no blurb. Nothing at the back cover of the book and nothing in the first few pages. This was a bit annoying. It just jumps right into the story so I had to Google on what the story is all about. That's a very small issue and I'm fine with it. But...I will be honest and say that I really really did not enjoy the book. The book tells the story about Holden, it is told from his perspective as he tell us - the readers - a bit about himself and the things that he did before a certain Christmas. What I did not enjoy:The plot: There was basically no plot. It is just basically what I have said earlier. To me it was like reading this boy's diary entry. I did not see any significance in his story. It was a very boring retelling of events in his life that did not pique my interest at all. The Character: It did tell me that the boy is a very very annoying boy who gets depressed at just about anything, thinks too much, very annoying to other people and selfish, bipolar personality, a lil bit of a pervert and so much more. I read on the internet that this book was about teenage alienation, rebellion and all about identity crisis. I understand that. I know all about that feeling. I have even experienced it. That is why I don't like Holden's character. If you are a teenager facing some normal teenage crisis then that's fine. But if you are a teenager with so many issues (issues that doesn't even make sense sometimes) that you place yourself in danger and hurt the people around you that try to help you, nor do you have any desire to change your ways definitely, then you are not a very pleasant character to me. This book did portray and discuss all the issues regarding alienation, rebellion and identity crisis etc. and kudos to that. I think this is one of it's strong point. But I just thought the character was unpleasant, making his stories either uninteresting or offensive. To me, there are other ways to write an inspirational story with hidden messages while using a pleasant character. All in all, if you are interested in stories of life and the problems we face as we grow up then this might be the book for you. It's popularity speaks for itself. "
1849,Veda Hamill,"I re-read this classic last month. All I remembered from high school days was this sense of anger. I didn't particularly care for the book then, and I still don't now, having re-read it. But I do understand it better. However, a friend wanted to know what I thought about it, so here goes . . .Back in high school, when I first read The Catcher in the Rye, I had this sense of anger. And that's about all I remembered from it. This time what I sensed was fear, not anger. And don't we often come across as angry when what we really are is afraid. But we don't want our fear found out, so we lash out, become angry.Holden is afraid. He's afraid of growing up. And I think he's afraid of not being good enough. He's afraid of rejection. He's flat out afraid. He doesn't apply himself in his studies. I think, because he's afraid of not being good enough. If he doesn't even try, then you don't really know if he could do well. But if you try, then you expose what you are and are not capable of. He's afraid of social rejection, so he sneers at anyone that has any kind of success - his jock roommate, the professional pianist, movie stars, the girl he took out. He doesn't like anything; he doesn't do anything. Everything to him is phony. But it's really not. He just uses that as a front to hide his fears. It is hard for me to have any sympathy for this character. I delight in many things. I like trying new things. I have difficulty empathizing with Holden. His fear turns him into an arrogant ass who then is rejected, the very thing he didn't want. The only time Holden seems happy is when he's doing something for his little sister. There is the key. He's doing something *for* someone else. And he lets his guard down. He's real, and thus vulnerable, with her.So much of what I'm learning from the little of Buddhism I read seems to call to this situation. Being vulnerable does open one up to the pain of rejection. But that is better than the phony-ness of Holden himself, that phony-ness he so despised was what he ended up being.One thing struck me at the beginning of the book. One of his advisers at the school which was kicking him out told him that it was all a game. And to a large degree it is. School, work, religion - all to a certain extent is a game. Which is disgusting to deal with when your soul desires to be authentic. But you have to play the game to a certain degree to earn a place where you don't have to play the game any more. Jump through the hoops the teacher lays out, even if it is BS until you get your degree and can move on. Jump through the hoops your employer lays out, even if its BS until you gain enough experience to move on, or funds to be financially independent, or find another means to make a living. You have to play some games long enough to gain the means of living life the way you think is authentic. And you also have to figure out what you believe an authentic life is. But remember, be kind to those who still have to play the game, or have a different idea of what an authentic life is.The one truth I have discovered this past year is that kindness matters. If Holden had kept that uppermost in his dealings with people, he would not have had so much to fear. Yes, he would have been hurt, used, rejected by some. But he would have been so much better off. It does take, I think, a certain degree of maturity to be able to continue to be kind in the face of being hurt, used, and rejected. Something I'm still working on myself.This seems rather disjointed, but there it is. I have a little more sympathy for the main character. But I still don't care for the book. Not terribly uplifting."
1850,Tammy Murray,Classic Schmassic!! I kept waiting for something to happen. A depressing read.
1851,Sigrun,"Well, I tried to read this book. I've had it for decades, but never felt like tackling it. Considering the time it was written, I guess I ""knew"" more or less that I would not be too pleased with it, and it did end up being one of the few books that I did not finish once I'd started it. I guess the writer's imagination just did not run along any of the lines that mine does. Although I was living when the book came out, I was not actively part of the way of living, as portrayed in the book. I decided to spend my time reading something more instructive or more fun.For many other readers, however, it has proven to be a remarkable reading experience."
1852,Tangee,"This was a terrible read. For it being a ""classic"" I was disappointed in what it didn't offer...a real story."
1853,Luiz,"Disappointing book. Generally referred to as one of the great classics, a must read, but I find it lacking on content. The story follows a high school during a weekend immediately after he is expelled from a rich boarding school. He goes out, walks around, rides around by taxi, goes to bars, meet some girls, that's about it. Not much happens in the book, and there is not really a story here. The book is all about nostalgia, it feels like it's just an excuse for the writer to repeat over and over how things used to be great, but now everyone is a phony; how kids are true, and adults are fakes; how old and disillusioned with everything he is. And this doesn't sound like a high school student at all, it sounds like a 40-year old who wishes he was a kid... Maybe at some point in time this book was edgy because it uses the work goddammit liberally and the f-word a few times at the end, but I really didn't find anything in the book that makes it still interesting."
1854,Alexis Hughes,"I've tried to read this book several times out of some idea that it's one of those books you ""should"" read. I can't seem to get more than half way through it because I just don't care. Holden is painfully uninteresting. There are some great reviews here about why this book is boring so I'll just leave it at that. "
1855,Jennie,"I had an English professor once say when writing make sure that if you must curse then don't abuse it. This book certainly abused it. While I understand it is part of the casual conversation and a catch phrase during the time period, it totally distracted me. I counted the phrase being used up to 5 times on one page. I lost interest in the book but kept reading thinking it would surely get to the point. It never did. I'm not sure why it's a classic nor why it's read in high school English classes, but I can see why it causes controversy. Definitely a sleeper and will be used the next time I have insomnia. NO DEPTH AT ALL"
1856,Maria Luiza Lopes,"Antes de ler esse livro, tinha lido algumas críticas positivas que diziam que o Holden só reclamava o livro todo, mas que chegaria o ponto do livro no qual eu entenderia o porquê e ficaria com peso na consciência por ter detestado tanto as reclamações dele. Guess what...terminei o livro e não encontrei esse momento no qual o Holden de redime do seu comportamento. Para mim esse livro só coloca mais fogo na fogueira das pessoas que focam nos aspectos negativos da vida. É muito fácil agir como o Holden, só reclamando de tudo e todos, difícil é ir contra a corrente e tentar mudar o quadro que se estabeleceu ao seu redor. Eu entendo a visão linda que ele tem sobre as crianças e que no geral as outras pessoas tem comportamentos cruéis inexplicáveis, mas perder a fé no mundo não é algo que mereça meu respeito. Chame-me de sonhadora, mas é a minha opinião.Eu gosto de imaginar o futuro dos personagens ao terminar um livro e na minha humilde imaginação, Holden ainda estava muito imaturo para digerir tudo que aconteceu em sua vida, no futuro ele vai entender melhor e finalmente encontrar a felicidade. Caso contrário, sou obrigada a concordar quando o professor Antolini fala ao Holden: ""- Não quero te assustar, mas vejo você, com toda clareza, morrendo nobremente, de uma forma ou de outra por uma causa qualquer absolutamente indigna."""
1857,Brooke,I'm rating this book a 0.5/5 stars because the writing style is just not my style. I was really hoping to like this book since it's a classic but I guess I just can't like every classic I read 
1858,Caitlyn Baratti,"This book is about a high school student who has just been kicked out of his private boarding school. Holden’s parents are not yet aware of his predicament and will not find out till Wednesday seeing as he isn’t expected home for Christmas break until that date. It is now Saturday and instead of going home to face his parents he decides to spend his time elsewhere, but all the people at his school are still attending classes and having exams. He hops a train to Manhattan, where he lives, anyway but he has no intention of going home. Instead he wonders through the city meeting up with people and dropping in to se his younger sister. At the end of the book we don’t find out what happens to Holden because he simply decides he doesn’t feel like telling usI did not enjoy this book. I felt the narrator became increasingly negative throughout the book. Holden didn’t like this person because they had acne, or he didn’t like this place because the people were too classy. It never seemed like he was in a good mood or had anything nice to say. I also felt like the book had no purpose. The author, Jerome David Salinger, didn’t seem to care about making his book have a point. Holden just wandered around till Wednesday and we don’t even find out what happens when his parents find out he's been kicked out of another school. MY frustration with that is that would be the only interesting part of the book. Does he get in trouble? Or, are his parents just fed up by now and don’t care? I just feel like it doesn’t take great skill to write a book about a kid who pokes around the city for awhile and just finish it without tying any loose ends"
1859,Jen Kosegi,Can someone please explain to me what the point of this book is? I kept waiting for something to happen. Still waiting. 
1860,Ashley,I really cannot stand this book. It's more written for young adults. The main character gets kicked out of his school and just complains about everything in his life.
1861,Courtney Payne,honestly i think this is not a good book.i think it couldve been very better.the characters are so irrelevant to the outside world
1862,Jenny Hoang,"Tính cách của cậu bé rất giống một người bạn thân của tôi, duy một điều bạn tôi là nữ mà thôi. Thật sự cuốn sách này cuốn hút tôi bởi bìa sách hết sức đơn giản, tên sách nghe có vẻ rất trong sáng và tôi có ý định mua giới thiệu đến mấy đứa cháu của mình.Phải 1/3 đứa bạn tôi hỏi đến đều thích cuốn sách này, nhưng tôi không được thoải mái cho lắm về giọng văn trong ấy, nó rất là ""cà chớn"" và không phù hợp để giới thiệu đến mấy đứa nhỏ, cháu tôi."
1863,Janis Gilbert," I am trying to read several of the classics, but this book was, to me, was not a good book. I thought Holden, the 16 year old, was a very bad example of a teenager. He was crooked, lazy, crazy, etc. I could not even be sorry for him. Why this is a classic I'll never know. Since his debut in 1951 as The Catcher in the Rye, Holden Caulfield has been synonymous with ""cynical adolescent."" Holden narrates the story of a couple of days in his sixteen-year-old life, just after he's been expelled from prep school, in a slang that sounds edgy even today and keeps this novel on banned book lists. It begins,""If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was born and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth. In the first place, that stuff bores me, and in the second place, my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them.""His constant wry observations about what he encounters, from teachers to phonies (the two of course are not mutually exclusive) capture the essence of the eternal teenage experience of alienation.( "
1864,Shilo,I hated this book. I only read it because I was stuck in an airport for hours. I still put it down several time. I had high expectations. It is boring and the character unlikable.
1865,Iris Yu,"I really did not like this book at all. Holden never has motivation to do anything in life, he skips school, he runs away, and if the number of schools he has been kicked out of is any indication, he has zero desire to educate himself. Even his ""dream jobs"" completely and utterly lack ambition of any kind. Perhaps my dislike is due to the fact that I cannot connect to his character at all. Of course, there are some minor similarities, but his absolute lack of ambition overshadows all of these traits to the point where his character is downright annoying.Furthermore, even though Holden moves around the city throughout the book, nothing new ever happens. For the entire duration of the book, I expected there to be a climax, a significant event, but as far as I have noticed, there is no such thing.The novel as a whole was very flat, unchanging, and boring. Holden never changed, and as a result, his actions and his choices never changed; thus, history continually repeated, and though he was in a different setting, the same things would happen over and over. The only slight bit of colour was his sister Phoebe, who is undoubtedly my favourite character."
1866,Adam,"The premier book of Western Culture. Just kidding, you know that kid that sits around and cuts himself? Hello Holden."
1867,Cam,"I'm going to be very honest here. I really wanted to love this book. By page ten I was just hoping to like it. In the middle of the book I often wondered how the heck I was going to get through it. I supposedly read this book in high school or earlier but I can honestly say I have never read this book until now. I was very disappointed. I will say however, I am not a literary genius by any means but I do love a good book. This unfortunately was not a good one. "
1868,Ashlee,"I have no idea why this is a classic. It doesn't bode well for a Beatles fan when one reads this book, as Mark David Chapman, had this book in his possession when he shot John Lennon outside of the Dakota in 1980 (I beieve it was in December). So, I didn't have a very open mind when I read this particular novel. I also found it boring. I don't know. Maybe there has to be a little something psychotic about you to be able to read and understand the plot. I felt that the story was weak and that the character was a person that I couldn't care about. Everytime I think of reading that book, I get upset. This book sucks (and I have read a lot of books)."
1869,álvaro,"Lo leí de chaval, porque era lectura para clase, y no me gustó nada. El protagonista me pareción imbécil. No sé si ahora le encontraría otro punto..."
1870,Robin,"Sure it's a classic but I hated it. So what if Holden had some difficulty and teenage angst. Who hasn't? He used his life as an excuse and wallowed in his situation, rather than accepting the situation and moving on. Make the best out of life and grow from challenges."
1871,Katy,"I hate Holden Caulfield. I read this as a teenager and couldn't rate to Holden, which makes this extremely hard to read or care about. "
1872,Sam,This book didn't leave an impression on me - I hardly remember it at all. It was recommended to me by my English teacher when I was at school - I still don't know why. I remember reading it expecting it to be amazing in some way - it wasn't. All it left me with was wondering why my teacher thought I would like it. 
1873,Kylia,"Like most people I read this book when in school. A few years ago I thought it was awful when i read it. I honestly do not recall much of the book other than Holden is suppose to appear ""misunderstood"" though to me he just comes off and whiney and stupid. The swearing in this book in all is not offensive but more unessary. I know many people really like this book but I do not. I do not think I will attemp to read this book agian."
1874,Kati,"I guess I can understand why the adolescent male really connects with this book. Just a whole lot of immaturity and bad language all rolled into about 200 pages. I want to tell Holden to ""get over yourself, already"". I don't understand why this is considered a classic. Blah."
1875,locrian,"I really don't understand what is the appeal of this book or why everyone has to read it in school. For one, the main character is a major douche and the entire book had me cringing at his douchyness (but maybe that IS the appeal, and its just douches who like the douchyness of him). Also I can't stand the word ""phony"", it grates on my ears in an actually painful manner, even when I read it, so reading it 100 or however many times in this short (the only redeeming quality) book was unbearable. Nope, I really don't get what I was supposed to learn and/or enjoy from this book."
1876,Gary,"Probably the most overrated book of the 20th century. The writing style is horrid and the story isn't the least bit interesting. Salinger should have looked into a career as a short-order cook, because he sucked at writing. "
1877,Dana Cooke,"Perhaps if you are a teenager this book might be a good read. As an adult and a parent, I feel like it was just more whining from a teenager who thinks the world is unfair to him, too."
1878,Kate,I read this in high school...I guess it's well-written but I didn't think it was anything special. The main character was pretty pathetic and whiny - not my style. 
1879,Mally,"I heard so many good things about this book that I thought to myself ""I refused to read it in high school, hell why not read it now!"". I should have just stuck with not reading it. This book SUCKED! The book starts on some random day & ends on some random day. There is no beginning middle or end. It's like spending 2 days with some kid that hates school - in a TON of details - and then it ends. I was the kid that hated school and I've lived 27 years. My life is much more interesting than this crap! UGH! Glad I bought this book at borders at 80% off. Had I read this crap in school instead of hang out with my friends I would have been pissed off! "
1880,Leo Andrie,"I had always thought of this book as a classic that I had never got around to reading. Well, my girlfriend at the time loved this book and told me that I should read it too so I did. I told her that it was good...but I'm also a liar.In truth, it's a boring book that goes nowhere and makes me wish that I had spent my time doing something more constructive, like reading the labels on ketchup packets."
1881,Ruth Bolard,Why are teachers torturing students with this book? Why is this book considered literature? I am female and may not fully understand the male viewpoint but seriously? This book is about NOTHING. Holden contradicts himself every other statement and does not complete a single thought. Blah......
1882,Natalie,Boring. I couldn't get into it. 
1883,Wendy,"This is a ""classic"" that I never read in high school. Now that I have read it, I don't think I missed anything by not reading it sooner."
1884,Alex Hajovy,This book was not very interesting and was a waste of a read. The book has no interesting parts and is depressing and boring 
1885,Cliff Watt,"Self indulgent ponderous nonsense, setting out purely to shock the audience of the time. "
1886,Craig Hayes,"Booooooo. Why would I want to read about a cynical, depressed teenager when I know so many emo kids in real life? Thanks for pointing out the obvious qualities in so many angst-ridden teenagers."
1887,Shawna,"I kept reading this to the end hoping I would discover why this book is so popular. I finished it last night and I still have no idea why this book ever became popular. I think it's awful, boring and pointless. I just don't get it. "
1888,Daianara,"The most horrible, boring, monotonous, uninteresting book I've read in the past year. I really don't believe I was this kid when I was a teen. He's simply all over the place. For him everyone is a phony, everything takes 10 hours or 50 years (""It was playing “Oh, Marie!” It played that same song about fifty years ago when I was a little kid.""), everything is depressing him (""That depressed the hell out of me."") and if he's depressed then he can't be held accountable for the stupid stuff he does.Some more quotes as examples:""I simply happen to find Eastern philosophy more satisfactory than Western. Since you ask.” “You do? Wuddaya mean 'philosophy'? Ya mean sex and all? You mean it's better in China? That what you mean?”Yes Holden, that's what he means.""I would have walked down to their house, because I didn't want to spend any of Phoebe's Christmas dough that I didn't have to, but I felt funny when I got outside. Sort of dizzy. So I took a cab. I didn't want to, but I did.""Oh yes, this supreme dizziness put a gun to your head and made you take a cab you didn't really want to take.Not to mention almost nothing happens in the whole book. It is, in short, the story of a weird kid that gets expelled from a prep school for the n-th time, and, instead of going back home, he spends the remaining 3 days till Christmas break getting into a lot of stupid situations. Like asking for a hooker in his hotel room and then being robbed by her pimp. Oh yes, a true masterpiece."
1889,Adam Vincent,Only got through 90 pages before giving up. Sorry Holden but my life is too short to listen to you tell me about yours.
1890,Taciturn,"My absolute least favourite book of all time. I tried to read it when I was about 15, and hated it. When I read it 11 years later, I still hated it. Holden, the main character, simply irked me to no end."
1891,Mythili,"I simply could not relate to Holden - who spends much of his spoiled existence complaining about disillusionment and other nonsense issues. Maybe if he showed any sort of vulnerability, I might have felt more compassion for him. But, by the end of this plotless book, I was just fed up with him. "
1892,Leslie Gelfand,"read in high school and re-read just a few years ago - upon the second reading, very disppointing. i recall being able to identify with that teenage angst of holden when i myself was a teen, but now he just seems like a pain in the ass and insane - god, was i the same when i was a teen?!"
1893,Dorothy Bandusky,"This is an extremely depressing book. There are no characters to root for. Everyone is whiny and crabby... and drunk half the time. There is no visible plot at all and the language is the worst that I have ever had the misfortune of reading. (including the use of the f-word no less than four times) What's wrong with just saying ""He swore/she swore""? Why do I have to actually read the profanity/blasphemy/vulgar language? This is a very depressing, plot less, and vulgar book and I do not recommend reading it."
1894,Rosalyn,"I bought this as it came out top in a bbc book review by several ""known"" people.I am at a total loss as to how this book could have made it to the top of the list let alone made it to any list. I found it absolute drivel and it ended up being one of a very select few books that I never finished. Avoid it at all costs. "
1895,Leslie Lynn,I hated this book. I really did.
1896,jessica,"gotta admit i read this because of how often it shows up on banned/challenged books lists, compared to how equally it's assigned in school classes. nothing else motivated me to even pick it up.my initial suspicions were correct-- it's the ultimate novel of teen angst. lots of whining, lots of cursing, lots of the protagonist just generally being obnoxious. holden caulfield seems to hate every*one* and every*thing*, and everyone's a phony. this piece of crap only had one good thing going for it: it wasn't boring, really, and Salinger's writing style made for an easy read."
1897,Charlotte Rigby,"Really didnt enjoy it. I didnt really like the style it was written in, and found the story boring, and didnt really think much happened, especially since the ending wasnt really explained. I felt like I should enjoy it, because it wins so many awards and everything, but i just didnt."
1898,Deborah Ideiosepius,"The Catcher in the RyeI read this book at age 16 because it was 'a classic' and because various writers and other people I respected raved about it. I found it so devoid of any positive factors that I assumed there were multiple books by the same title. Then I found that no, this was it. I read it fifteen years after the first reading assuming that I had been too young to 'get it'. No, it was still devoid of any interest and I wanted those hours of my life back. Most cereal containers are more interesting to read.Not only do I find it brain numbingly boring, I found it impossible to fathom why anyone would find it otherwise. When I read Bridget Jones' Diary I could at least see why some other people would like something so utterly inane. CITR still escapes me."
1899,Jena Sebald,"I absolutely despise this book.Like most Americans I read this book as a teenager for high school. Now sometimes the way books get read in school (read the chapter. stop. wait. discuss. read the next chapter) can take away from the enjoyment of a book. Because of this I try to re-read books that I didn't like while in school to give it a fair chance. And a few times I've been pleasantly surprised. That was not the case here.This is book about a well off teenager who complains non stop through the entire book and sees everything that isn't himself as fake, false or phony. He is one of the most tedious characters I've ever come across.The book's has a couple sexual scenes that people in the 1960s thought were alarming and got it banned. Thats the only thing I can think of that explains why this book became as big as it it. "
1900,Spinch,"Holden Caulfield is a petulant little shit who needs to have the emo beaten out of him with a boat oar. I know this is one of the ""great works"", but I honestly did not care a whit about Holden, his life, or his complaints. I don't really care for Salinger's writing style. This is one of the few books that I have read and thought ""Wow, I really want those hours of my life back."" "
1901,Alexis,"I read this book as a recommendation from a teacher, and did not enjoy a single second of it. The entire time I kept thinking ""how is this an American classic?"" I feel like the author just got a little drunk, came up with half of a story and then word vomited onto the paper. Very dry, very hard to get into, and generally boring."
1902,Chris Costes,Had heard of this book before and thought it was one of the many that lots of people had to read in school that I never did (To Kill a Mockingbird was another). I really enjoyed To Kill a Mockingbird; unfortunately I can't say the same for this book. The whole time I was reading this I kept asking myself 'what is the point to all this?' I can now say that there was no point. From what I've read of other reviews this seems to be a very polarizing book. You either identify with the main character and enjoy this window into his life or you don't and it just never gets your interest. I was definitely in the later category. It's not a buy for me.
1903,Dominique Salcedo,Didn't like it at all.
1904,Indranil Saha,A big boring piece. Took a long time to finish. Didn't meet my expectation in comparison to its big hype. I was bound to skip few pages due to its repeated style of useless and depressive narration.
1905,Severien,"Dit boek was héél snel uit, in een weekje al. Goed geschreven wel, maar misschien ben ik al te oud om dit nog ten volle te apprecieren. Teleurstellend einde ook.. En naar het einde toe geraakte ik steeds meer geïrriteerd door Holden. Wat mij betreft niet echt een aanrader."
1906,Andy P,"I hate this book with a burning and fiery passion. Holden Caulfield is detestable and unreliable as a narrator. He calls others ""phonies"" when it's clear that is exactly what he is. He scorns others and believes himself to be above them and there's no indicator as to why. Not only that, he's incredibly creepy towards any woman he meets. This book brings nothing to the table, and the only people that enjoy it are fatalists. "
1907,Owen,"What an absolute waste of time - I was set to give up on this about half way through, but I persevered, much to my dismay, it didn't get any better. A whiny yellow mouthy brat teenage whines for 277 pages. It's a 'coming of age' story, with entirely no growth. "
1908,Ryan Martin,"This was very possibly the worst book I have ever read. I read a lot. There is no plot. there is no point. There is no story. All that happens is some whiny jerk comes home from school. Problems are introduced, but they aren't problems that the reader cares about because he doesn't care about the protaganist because the protaganist is a stupid jerk. More annoyingly, the problems in it are never resolved. it's like Salinger wrote halfway through a book, then got as sick of Caulfield as the rest of us did, and just stopped writing. It leaves the reader with a thorough sense of annoyance at having read through all of Caulfield's whining for nothing.Don't read it. I wish I hadn't."
1909,david,"maybe reading this for the first time at age 48 was a mistake. i read for the pleasure, to relax, to exercise my mind. there's not much i won't read. one of my shortcomings is it's difficult to quit reading a book once i've started. with catcher in the rye that posed a problem. fortunately the book wasn't 900 pages long. I DIDN'T LIKE IT, but as is my mo i kept reading hoping to salvage something. an american literary classic? hmmm, i'll describe it differently....painful to read. "
1910,Joanne Santos,I've been trying to read this book for two years and I just could not get past the second chapter. Holden annoyed me so much. I believe I may have read this a little too late. I should have read it when I was in high school.
1911,Roxane Lapa,"I'm generally not a fan of books written in the first person perspective so I suppose this book didn't really stand much of a chance with me, but I wanted to read it anyway to see what all the hype was about. I found the constant blaspheming annoying. The story itself was mildly entertaining though seriously lacking a plot of any kind. It was just ok. I would have given one more star if I didn't have to read 'goddam' and 'for crissakes' in every second sentence."
1912,Karen Cairns,I can't believe how whiney this book was. No plot. I made myself finish it hoping there would be a grand finale of some sort. It just ended stupidly. Time wasted reading this one just to say I finally read it.
1913,Tricia Sutton,"I think if you removed all the sentences he wrote that said ""All of a sudden--for no good reason, really, except that I was sort of ..."" (which, btw, the last one I read was on page 30. The page I stopped reading), and if you removed all of the suddenlys, and alls, and otherwise very repetitive sentences that sounds like a skipped record, you'd have three pages of actual story. A story that may have held my interest had it been written well."
1914,Sammy,"i am not a particular fan of this book, but I do admit that I should probably give it another go and reread it. I do believe though this book is like Marmite, you either love it or you hate it. I personally could not stand the character Holden Caulfield from the very first page so I do not think the story stood much of a chance for me to like."
1915,Arin Williams,"Reading this plotless book about a self-absorbed, badly-behaved teenager was a chore, and not something I would drag myself through again. Holden Caulfield certainly finds himself to be superior to everyone around him. The most insightful part of the book occurred when his younger sister asked him if he actually likes anything. I wondered the same, as he constantly prattles on about how he hates this, that, and the other thing. Caulfield is the prototype for what we now call a hipster--a person who sits high on their soapbox looking down on the ""phonies"" of the world."
1916,Hurricanej,"Children grow up to dislike books because adults make them read 'literature' such as ""The Catcher in the Rye""."
1917,Andrea L,"Read this again 15 years later to see if my high school opinion had changed at all. Nope, Holden is still a whiny bitch. I just don't get why this is on the 'must read' list for students."
1918,Ashleigh,"WHAT THE FUCK! WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK! This is a truly terrible book. it has no plot, the character's the most stupid and annoying little shit, and the writing is quite bad. most of the way through this I wanted to tear it into tiny pieces, set it on fire, and throw it into the ocean. I could have written better. This waste of trees is very, very overrated. don't even get me started on the 5 blank pages at the end. Why the hell is this so praised."
1919,Dumbarsee,"Seriously? I mean SERIOUSLY??? I hear such rave reviews about this book and it turns out to be about a crazy guy whose dialect I don't even understand. Maybe it was so bad because I had to write a 3 page long book review on it. Try figuring out a mad man for a book review, I wouldn't go back for a second read even if my life depended on it."
1920,Jayelle,"I know this is supposed to be one of the classic books, but it just depressed me. Self-absorption in it's lowest form. "
1921,Vanteacher,Not a fun read. As a descriptive narrative I see the value. As a story.. I dislike it.
1922,Leigh Anne,"I tried to put more effort to like it, but no. Words were written repetitively it's kinda annoying. Felt like it's just me who's speaking, very casual. ""This that and all"""
1923,Lenka Halásová,"horrible book, never again.. NEVER!!! "
1924,Mike Mercurio,"The lead character bothered me quite a bit, but his younger sister was the saving grace of the book at least for me."
1925,Stephanie Woodland,"I have NO idea why people love this book! I really tried to like it, mostly because many people whose opinion about books I respect loved it. It was sooooo boring, and following around this whining, complainer was just too much. I may have read it at the wrong time in my life, but I used hours of my life to read it that I can never get back."
1926,Shana,"I read this book for the first time in the 8th grade. I had to get my mom to sign a permission slip because of the cursing. Before I began reading, I had so many expectations. Back then, I read Seventeen Magazine, and back then, Seventeen Magazine ran brainy features about books and poetry. There was one feature where they asked people what book changed their lives, and something like more than half said Catcher in the Rye. I think there might have been some celebrity comments in there, too. At any rate, it was a ringing endorsement.So you can imagine my disappointment when I hated it. Not only did I hate Holden, but I hated everything about the novel. There was nothing I enjoyed. I did my book report where I confessed my hatred (which led my teacher to confess that she did, too), but I couldn't let it go. I honestly felt that my loathing of a novel that so many others found ""life-changing"" indicated some deep and horrible flaw. I felt like hating Catcher in the Rye was my dirty little secret.Time passed, and my self-loathing mellowed. I began to think that perhaps I'd come at it too young, so after my first year of college, I decided to re-read it, go at it with fresh eyes, and see if my opinion had changed.Here's the thing: it hasn't. I get it. I get that Holden is supposed to be loathsome. I get that he is the hypocrite he hates. I get that almost all teenagers go through the kind of thinking he experiences. I get it. I do. I just don't like it.Oh, and I'm not ashamed anymore."
1927,Malia Humphry,"I read the novel The Catcher In the Rye by J.D. Salinger because I was forced to in my English class for my book club. This story takes place on the East coast in New York and at a boarding school called Pencey Prep. The main character is the biggest hater I’ve ever seen and he doesn’t seem to find joy in anything except his younger sister, girls, and his childhood friends. The main character, Holden Caulfield, gets himself kicked out of boarding school, which doesn’t even matter to him because he didn’t like anything there, and starts on his way home. On his journey home, he meets up with a couple of childhood friends expecting things would be the same as they were as children. To his despise, it seemed like all of his old friends were growing up and becoming adults. Once he finally reaches home(FINALLY after like 250 pages of traveling), Holden learns through his little sister, that you can enjoy things from when you are young, but you need to grow up some day. I really don’t like the way this story ends because I thought that there was going to be more to what happens. I thought he would get a happy ending or something big and climactic. Instead, I was disappointed to read that Holden just settles with what he has and sits and watches his sister at the zoo. I’m not quite sure if I even understand what the ending means but I know that it was no big whoop. In my opinion, this book was a good life lesson to those who may be going through a midlife crisis. Although, I was not the biggest fan of the character, storyline, or Holden’s uneducated, almost incomprehensible, vocabulary. "
1928,stephan,"I read this, or started to anyway, my super senior year of college. After all the hype, the bannings, etc I was expecting something great - instead I was so bored by this pathetic loser and a plot that was going nowhere apparent that I gave up partway through. I guess some folks like it, and maybe I would have at a different time of my life - but I disliked it intensely..."
1929,Margi,"Like many people here, I read The Catcher in the Rye when I was a freshman in high school. I did not like it then. My taste in books have changed so I decided to read it again. I found Holden insufferable when I was young and I find him insufferable now. I can't imagine anyone who didn't grow up upper middle class relating to him. It's just a story of a rambl-y kid with too much time and no actual problems."
1930,Peter Riboprotein,This book is crap.
1931,Kimberly Martin,"Watched the J D Salinger documentary on PBS this week and am going to read this again.It is still a fail. I don't understand why this book is listed as a classic nor do I understand how three people felt compelled to shoot innocent people ( hinkley ronald reagan and tom bradley, campbell john lennon and the guy who shot the rising star actress of the series "" my sister sam)after reading this book?after watching the documentary, people fell in love with this book because the main character, Holden, points people out as phoneys and all these teenagers and young adults appaulded this character insight. I miss be missing something because HOLDEN IS THE PHONEY! He gets kicked out of an elite school ( his fourth) and instead of facing his parents knowing that the dean sent his termination letter to his parents and thinks he has 3 days before his parents will receive said letter, so he goes to New York City, lie about himself, his name and puts himself in these situations that are stupid. He just your typical angry kid who thinks he knows more than adults ( like most young adults), won't listen to anybody and believes he has it all figured out.I can see why this book was not required reading at my high school in the 80's in KCK because of the swearing in the book as well as his analogies are violently themed i.e page 106 he describes how a guy really likes a girl as "" cutting his throat over her."" Yes, I understand Salinger was in WW 2 when he carried 6 chapters of this book with him and wrote this book during WW2 and he spent over 200 days in horrific war battles until the war ended on V day, but jeesh, this book is loaded with violent references and what is sad the main character can't fight! Holden is always running his mouth and when push come to shove, he can't fight, cannot stick up for himself so he couldn't help anyone else ( i.e. damsel in distress) and yet he feels he is so powerful great guy when in fact HE IS THE PHONEY!I think this book is overrated. Maybe this was the first book of its kind that came out in which described what young males were feeling in the 50's and 60's and now years later television, movies, music have taken this step further with depicting young adult's move from child to adulthood, realizations one's parents aren't the all and powerful but human, and people make mistakes and one has to make one's way in the world, I will give this book credit for that. This book was difficult to like and while I was reading this, I kept thinking, "" So what"" and "" what is the big deal about this book?"" since it still sells over 250,000 copies each year. well, I read it again and no I am not going to read the detailed books of the HOlden life up to his suicide prior to him searching for God which is suppose to come out between 2015 and 2020 as the documentary teased at the end that Salinger gave permission to have this and two other books released after his death ( which is what he was working on all these years).I think salinger was like any other writer/artist: don't change my stuff, what I create is personal and his tantrums when editors changed the title or this that and the other is a part of publishing. ask any writer and i think salinger was just too sensitive about his work and was over dramatic just like any eccentric artist. so to me, he wasn't any different than Warhol or Monroe etc. He just chose to remove himself from the public ( when he chose to come out he did) and do what he loved to do and deal with his demons from war. Why people blew him up to be this false god of the publishing industry is beyond me. Sorry did get it and found his documentary interesting as most artist are."
1932,Meredith,"I didn't like it. I've read it twice and I...I just don't care about Holden. He's a pain, a bully, and not sympathetic in any way. I found myself wishing he'd get on with it and off himself by the middle of the book. I didn't find the writing all that good, and certainly not worthy of the praise Salinger gets. I've read 9 Stories too...same deal. "
1933,Elizabeth Taunton,"Catcher in the RyeBy: J.D. Salinger Reviewed by: Cierra Taunton  Like most every other high school student I was given Catcher in the Rye as a reading requirement. This book caught me be by surprise. There is truly only one underlying meaning to the book and that’s rebellion. J.D. Salinger who's the author this ""tip of your toes"" novel knew it exactly how to draw the rebellious crowd in. This book identifies the human condition and allows many teenagers to relate. The protagonist who’s Holden Caulfield, rants and raves about his experience in prep school while spending a week in Manhattan before going home to the inevitable wrath of his parents that awaits him. Though we never actually get to see the wrath unfold we know that it must be severe, because Holden fears going home as once again a failure to society.  This novel takes place in a 1950's setting, in a busy city where everything is always changing, and then again where something’s never change. Holden introduces us to several friends such as Stradlater and Ackley who must have impacted his life enough to tell them to us. Stradlater was the popular guy; the one who everyone thought was cool. Holden liked Stradlater but at the same time loathed him for taking out the one girl Holden really liked, who was Jane. Jane allows us to see Holdens deep side, the compassionate side that isn’t displayed very often except when talking about his brother Allie who died of leukemia. Allie is significant to the story because Holden thinks about him several times while reflecting back on the past. He looked at Allie as the perfect contribution to society. Allie was always happy and loved by anyone who knew him. Holden looked up to him even after his brother pasted away.  As mentioned in the book Holden goes through a time of change, a period of wanting to be old and sophisticated like his brother D.B., who happens to be a writer that lives in Hollywood. Holden wants to do things such as drink and smoke, those things were seen as highly rebellious in the fifties. Holden finds everything else “phony” about his brother. Hollywood is phony and so are the movies that are made in the city. Hollywood is not American to Holden. He goes against anything society applauds and at the time setting of the book Hollywood was very much at large in society. Holden might be identified by some as an outcast to society, and to himself a rebel.  The line that defines the book is as follows, ""Anyway, I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around -- nobody big, I mean -- except me. And I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff -- I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going. I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I'd do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all. I know it's crazy, but that's the only thing I'd really like to be."" This line really portrays Holden's true character, it tells the reader who he really is, his purpose and goals in life. Holden wants to save people from the madness he himself is experiencing, Holden really wants someone to catch him. He wants to mean something to society, instead of being the rebel in society. Also mentioned  I personally would not recommend this book to other teenagers, maybe to Mr. Barwick, who happens to be the best English teacher in the world, who is insane and likes insane things. On a serious note, I did not like this book because it never had a rise or fall, it stayed monotone all the way through and that is dull I believe. I didn’t walk away from the book learning or feeling anything. It was just kind of like ""what?"" Therefore, that’s why I gave this book only one star, I personally believe that’s all it deserves. "
1934,Aili Alechnowicz,I hate this book it's redundant it really is it really is it really is!! And crazy people worship it. I miss you John Lennon 
1935,Adelaine Pek,"There was a reason why I dreaded reading this book. I thought I would like this book, I really thought I will, seeing how I have a thing for controversial characters but man, this book succeeded in making me an anti-hero. A lot of people loved and many identify with Holden. But not me.The main character, Holden Caulfield is so goddamn whiny. He has no interests, he complains about everything and he is completely passionless. I get that Holden was as confused as a lot of adolescents are, trying to make sense of his loneliness and desperately trying to articulate what he really wanted to do in life. But there was never any moments of self-reflection or realizations of faults in the mirror. He hated phonies which are understandable, but he was just as phony as the people he criticised.Click here for full review: https://adelainepekreviews.wordpress...."
1936,Neil Block,ugh
1937,Melanie Winter,"Although this piece probably has a chapter in American literature, I did not like it. I am not a fan of Holden Caulfield. He is nihilistic and not interesting. Salinger is a man's writer. Maybe because I'm a woman I just don't get it."
1938,Peter Bryan,"I rated ""Catcher in the Rye"" as poor because it failed to impress me, linguistically or emotionally and because the first person narrative, the whining, relentless and grammatically incorrect prose of a teenager is something I struggle to tolerate in reality let alone when I chose to spend my precious spare time reading a book. Page 80 is where Holden and I parted company. Granted, I'm not the target audience but I found myself speed-reading too often to get to something more gripping. Another case of notoriety preceding the book."
1939,Solas Wall-Johnson,This is one of the worst books I have ever read and I completely agree with all the people who think it should be banned because it is horrible
1940,Jennifer Morris,Once a conductor saw me reading Gatsby on the train and struck up a convo on reading modern classics. He said Catcher in the Rye was unrelatable wank and I should have taken his word for it.
1941,Aleia,"Oh my Goodness! This book was so lame. I read it because it was one of ""the classics."" I totally could not get into it."
1942,Eric Bandera," The solo fact that teachers STILL have their students reading 'The Catcher in the Rye' in their class' is actually insulting. This book was meant for 9th graders, but is read by 10th and 8th graders. All the elements in the book; such as prostitution, dropping out of high school, breaking and entering, smoking cigarets, and and addiction to lying. These big factors in the book are, sadly, everyday things in a teenagers eyes. Teachers need to see the reality of the world we live in and actually give use books to read that we would relate and understand."
1943,Caleb,"Holden Caulfield never quite fit in with his surroundings. Be it the prestigious Pencey Academy or the hectic streets of New York, Holden always stood out like a sore thumb, shunned and shoved in a corner. Holden Caulfield's tired of being a ""failure"" in a sea of fakers and phonies.I've always shied away from this book for reasons I can't say. Unlike 1984, which I avoided because of the depressing ending or Crime and Punishment, which is about three times too long for me to handle, I've never been able to say why I've never read The Catcher in the Rye.It turns out my instincts were right. I found the main character boring, obnoxious, and spoiled. Everyone around him functions as a cog in society, while he is a wrench thrown into the middle of it, seemingly hellbent on making everyone's day a little more stressful. Caulfield's ability to repel almost anyone (myself included) is astonishing. I honestly can't relate to him. I typically enjoy J.D. Salinger's works and his painting of rich 40's New York city is skillful, but I strongly reacted against this novel. The ability to generate such a backlash from me must be a reason why it's considered a classic, but I can safely say that I will not pick up this book again. Cannot see why it's so relatable to other teenagers."
1944,Peter,"ЖЖ начала прошло века. КАк он всё ненавидит, как он все не любит. Юношеский максимализм и тд. Свосем не понравилось. "
1945,Debbie,I had to read this in high school or college and couldn't stand it. Maybe I was not mature or sophisticated enough yet. Ha
1946,Tatyana Kichukova,I have no idea why people are so crazy about this book!
1947,Diego,"I didn't like the main character, I didn't like the history, I didn't like the way it was written, and I don't understand the hype about this book, it isn't that good, just an apathetic boy about everything without any good reason, this isn't about depression, is about how a teenager boy can be a pain in the ass for everybody, even himself, and the worst is that the hole history doesn't have a real reason to be."
1948,Karen Tucker,"I'm not sure what the point of this book was or why it has had so much publicity. I never could find any hint towards an actual story line. If anyone has any idea why this book has received so much notoriety, please let me know. I must have missed something. I would never recommend this book to anyone."
1949,Richard,"My theory as to this book's unusually polarizing nature: either you identify with Holden Caulfield or you don't.Those who see themselves (either as they were or, God help them, as they are) in Holden see a misunderstood warrior-poet, fighting the good fight against a hypocritical and unfeeling world; they see in Salinger a genius because he gets it, and he gets them.Those of us who don't relate to Holden see in him a self-absorbed whiner, and in Salinger, a one-trick-pony who lucked into performing his trick at a time when some large fraction of America happened to be in the right collective frame of mind to perceive this boring twaddle as subversive and meaningful."
1950,Jodi,"This was probably the worst book I've ever read. I was able to finish it, but only because I kept hoping it would get better. Unfortunately, it didn't. Other than numerous swear words, the only word the main character said was ""phony"". "
1951,Kyra,"1.5 stars.I did not care for Holden Caulfield one bit. I did not relate to him, I did not understand him, and I did not care for his future. I hated, and absolutely hated, the writing style. It was so repetitive. In fact, even the story line was repetitive. He calls someone up, meets them, and leaves. He keeps talking about calling Jane up, but he never does. There seems to be no climax. He still wears his hunting hat, his 'shield' from the world, the only thing is, he decides to stay. I didn't identify with Holden. Like that one time he makes a plan to live with Sally, and he says he wants to in the moment, but after he can't think of why. I don't get him. It was a boring read, and I only gave it that .5 star because I appreciated the relationship between Holden and Phoebe in the last 50 pages, and I watched John Green's videos and I got the symbolism. That's it. "
1952,Kate Renee Wood,Hated it! Everything about it. The grammar was terrible and Holden Caufield should be shot. Insufferable little prick. Couldn't even finish it!! It actually makes me angry how much I hated it. I know its a classic and I get the point that Salanger is making. I don't care. I have NEVER been that horrible a person. If I was my mother would have strangled me. I would have let her do it too!Not in the slightest bit enjoyable. Just another pretentious untitled little idiot.Would not recommend to anyone ever! 
1953,Tabletj,"I know, I know. This is the book that changed your life. Well, maybe I'm too sensitive because I am still traumatized by this book. I love Salinger...just not this most famous book of his."
1954,Meowster,"I literally cannot describe in words how much I hated this book. Every other book I've ever read that I don't care for I just became indifferent to. But this book, this book in particular I have had such a strong loathing hatred for, that it's occasionally ended in google searches ""I hate Catcher in the Rye"". This is the worst piece of trash ever put on paper. I don't understand why it is considered 'great literature'. Just a useless spoiled asshole ranting on and on. I actually read to the end to see if HC develops any redeeming qualities as a human. He doesn't. I understand he isn't necessarily supposed to be a sympathetic protagonist, but he is so deplorable that I simply could not get past my desire to punch the kid in the face. Please take this used condom off school required reading lists. "
1955,Jo Brace,"Ugh, I detested this book. No story, nothing of interest, nothing that kept me going back for more other than it was a classic I wanted to tick off my list. I am probably far to old to be reading this for the first time. Had I been a teen I may have enjoyed all the angst much more. But then my teenage self was also quite well read, so I don't suppose I would have liked it then either."
1956,Pam,"ok. I actually had to QUIT this book. and I don't usually do that. I've done it once before in my life and that was ""In Her Shoes"" (thank god the movie redeemed it)!anyway, I thought FOR SURE that this book was a shoe-in since so many people speak volumes about it. I didn't get it. the main character was so whiny and the story went nowhere for me. I didn't feel involved at all and didn't care about any of the characters.I tried to give it a go... but it's on it's way to the used book store."
1957,Tamera,finally got around to reading this...think you have to be an angst -ridden male adolescent to appreciate it...
1958,Isabel,"I read it in Spanish and I didn´t understand enithing for me was a waste of time. I think, I didn´t understand enithing because I´m very young for that kind of books.I like more action "
1959,Steven Jacobs,"This book was worst book I've read so far by a long shot. It was like The Great Gatsby, but without any interesting themes or concepts governing it.If you want to read an entire book that doesn't contain any single page of interesting story, and on top of that has no deeper meanings or ideas to bring to light, then this book is perfect for you. This was probably the most boring book I've ever read."
1960,Britni Hart,"I, myself did not like this book. I didn't like the language used as well. I don't think it helped that it was a required book to read for my English class. "
1961,Jbolt1998,"Eh... I give the book three stars. There's nothing I find wrong with the book, but nothing I really find to be ok about it either. It's just not engaging. From the reviews that I have read on here it seems that you either love the book, or hate it. I wouldn't say I hate it, and I congratulate you if you can find enjoyment in it. I just can't. I understand that Holden is a loathsome, hypocritical person, I just don't really care. I'm not very good at criticizing things. Feels too negative. But, this book has no plot. It doesn't seem to have much if any character development. It's dialogue is boring and repetitive. Same goes for Holden's thoughts. Everyone is a phony, a moron, or just rude to his eyes. He encounters a couple characters who he considers to be ok, but none of them seem to be lasting. Maybe it connects to some people, but it really does not with me."
1962,Ray Daley,"I never finished this, I couldn't.It was THAT bad.I never made it very far into the book, I came to hate the lead character too much.He constantly says he hates phonies yet he spends all his time lying to the people he knows to impress them so he is exactly what he hates the most.I think I got as far as him inviting a hooker to his hotel room where he is then attacked by her pimp. I didn't read any further as I no longer cared if he lived or died.Not recommended at all. Avoid like you owe it money!"
1963,Merry,"""J.D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye is a coming of age novel, written from the prospective of the protagonist and first person narrator, Holden Caulfield in the 1950s era. The book details the week long stay in New York of Holden in the form of a flashback. Salinger portrays through the story the theme that growing up can be a hard and difficult experience. -from Book ReviewThat is the professional review I found on line, my review....In brief - A 1951 book that I just had to read because I have heard so much about it - so there, I've read it - Holden Caulfield has pretty much discovered how to twitter well before it was invented. I did not find this book insightful or interesting. Also, I currently live with a teenager, my son is 16, and suffice it to say, he will not be venturing off to any boarding schools. "
1964,T Bui,"If you don't like whiners I suggest you stay away from this book because the main character Holden is the perfect descriptor of a shitty, angsty teen. I hated him reading the book the first time in high school and hate him even more now reading it almost a decade later. Now matter how well written, poetic, or symbolic the plot of the book is if I hate the main character I'm just not going to enjoy it. More than anything I just want to punch Holden."
1965,Aericka Jyle,"I don't understand why some people think this is such a good book. It's basically about a guy expressing random thoughts in different chapters, the end. His thoughts are entertaining though, at least they bring some sense to you but how he thinks of some people so negatively is depressing! I kept on waiting for the part where things would get thrilling and all but nope... wish he'd just cut to the part where he got kicked out of school and went home."
1966,Jason Steinmann,Didn't finish. I didn't enjoy the cursing
1967,N.KH #,No comments!
1968,Nicolle Lim,"One of my biggest grammar pet peeves: ending a sentence with an unnecessary ""and all""/""or what""Ah. What a huge annoyance. If there is anything at all that I moderately liked about this book, that would be Houlden's affection for his little sister. Other than that, I just find this book annoying in general. The poor grammar and choice of words gave me a headache. The plot definitely didn't help. Didn't anyone bother offering Houlden a cup of tea??? All he needed to do was relax, but he ended up writing an entire book of his relentless ""depressing"" issues in life."
1969,Mindy,"This just might be the most overrated book of all time. If I wanted to listen to someone complain this much, I would just work as a therapist."
1970,Jana H,"My friend gave it to me. Told me it was genius. As I was reading it, I kept thinking to myself ""Man this kid is a spoiled little crap."" ""When is this book gonna get to the point?"" ""Man, I hope something interesting happens."" My friend kept saying, ""Hold on. It gets better. Just wait till the climax."" Guess what. THERE IS NO F'ING CLIMAX. It sucked. Classic my butt. I have read some great classics, I just wouldn't put this one on the list."
1971,Ashley Schmidt,I got thru page 66 of this book and had to let it go. Just not my cup of tea and a really unrelatable character for me. I am cutting my losses and moving on.
1972,Andrew Rogers,This book is really boring
1973,Diana Caissie,I think Holden Caulfield is a big phoney.
1974,Tamora Pierce,A sore disappointment. I couldn't see what all of the yelling was about.
1975,Mindi,i think you either you like this book or you don't. I am the don't. I have no ideas why it is a classic.
1976,Maryam,"This book sucked, really, big time. I gave this book 1 star and only one star; half of this star is for how Holden described Allie and the other half is for the conversation he had with Phoebe when he sneaked into the house. That's it, that's the only thing i liked in this book, well i know it have great analyzation and of course it meant a lot to the Salinger while he was writing it but i absolutely didn't like it."
1977,Heidi,"Holden Caulden, or whatever, is one of the most annoying characters in literature, and this book is one of my least favorite books that I've ever been forced to read. It's got too much hype for what it actually is. "
1978,Mercedes,"I read this book twice (once during first semester of sophomore year, then I switched schools and got to read it again in second semester) and hated it both times. I know not everybody shares my feelings, but to me Holden is the most annoying teenage character ever. "
1979,Lindsay,"Why is this book good? Am I missing something? I’ve read this book at least three times and looked at spark notes. But I still don’t get it. The messages in this book are too obvious, and when they’re not, they’re open to any and all interpretations. Holden was simplistic and NOT a poster child for adolescence. Yes teenagers are dark, yes they seek freedom and yes they’re confused, but Holden is normal. I don’t see how he’s sadistic! Oh well. If I don’t get it now, I don’t think I ever will…"
1980,Bishop,"Whiny, entitled, rich high school kid goes around mocking poorer people's suitcases and complaining about those who are less sexually repressed and bigoted than himself. In the end a former teacher attempts to molest him and then he gets shamed into maybe eventually going back to school again by his more competent elementary school age sister. One of the dullest narrative voices, blandest prose styles, and most fangless outsider stories I've ever read. Read No Longer Human or Notes from Underground if you want real ennui and misanthropy. Or Black Hole if you need your characters to be in high school. Or maybe some early Green Day lyrics. At least they have a sense of humor."
1981,Jane Hunter,I had to read this book for my degree. I was really looking forward to the read as many of my friends had already read the novel and love it. Personal I believe that the novel is over rated and lacks any significant narrative. There is many story lines within the novel which could be made more interested and expanded on. 
1982,Travis Taylor,Um.... ok. Apparently saying 'goddamn' a lot in the mid 20th century would get you some controversy and the inevitable and dubious title of 'classic.'
1983,Matt,I think South Park actually nailed this one. Had to read it three times in high school and am still mad about why. 
1984,Ian,"Absolutely no idea what all the fuss is about this book. It's dull, you hate the protagonist and absolutely nothing of any interest happens. Complete waste of time."
1985,Paris,Hate it. Hollingsworth 
1986,Melinda,"Seriously. Are you kidding me? Couldn't even finish this book. It actually wasnt even a book to me. It was pages and pages of profanity with a few words from the English language thrown in. It wasnt that it became offensive persay, it was so distracting that it became a serious annoyance. "
1987,Tara,can i give negative stars? i'd like the give negative stars to this book. 'didn't like it' is not nearly strong enough the express the feelings i have for 'catcher in the rye'. 
1988,Zoë,"I really genuinely god-honestly have 
NO
 idea why this book is so popular, successful, considered a classic, or why it is read in schools. Though it does make more sense now why kids hate reading, if this is the garbage that's geared toward them. And why YA has such a bad name. It wasn't just boring. It was ridiculous. I got bored by many classic books I had to read in school and thankfully I hadn't been a victim of this one, but I could still at least understand why they were considered ""classics"" even if I literally never want to see them again. (Well, I can understand why MOST of them are considered classics, there were one or two I think the world could've done without). This is literally just a kid whining. That's literally all it is. That's it. That's not an exaggeration. It is a hundred something pages of whining about stupid silly things. What? What is wrong with this guy? Well I think we know where the inspiration for Zoey Redbird came from.Also, I distinctly remember a part where he said something like, ""The next time I'm doing a girl, and she says No or to Stop, I'm just gonna keep going.""O_____ONot. Okay."
1989,Chrismueller,"Whilst I appreciate the massive impact this book had on the counterculture of its time, it is  boring! Holden, the protagonist, is candidly, a loser. The plot of the text is also flatlined; nothing happens!However, I can appreciate the value of this text, reflected through the language."
1990,BGP,"This is, without question, the most overrated book that I have had the grave misfortune to encounter. I will grant that, in its day, the book was probably read as a refreshing challenge to the generally accepted understanding of what it means to be a youth, but, by today's standards, Holden is a seventeen year old kid struggling through a sixth grade existential crisis. This book has not aged well. "
1991,Jesse van Doorn,"I hated this book. It is simultaneously incredibly dull, and incredibly frustrating. I spent the entire book wanting to smother the protagonist with a pillow. He's stupid, obnoxious, useless, and projects all his own horrible traits on the interesting people around him. This book was a lesson in hating a person. Usually we hate people for the bad things they do. I hated Holden Caulfield for has exquisite inaneness."
1992,Leyendecker1874,"I mean I read it b/c it's considered an American Classic, but I found the main character annoying and felt very apathetic towards him."
1993,Chuck Hughes,"Honestly, I didn't get this book at all, nor all they hype behind it. I found it tough to read and was very turned off by all the GDs that Holden seemed to use for everything. Just not my cup of tea."
1994,Sandhya Bhatt,"this book was banned for some time in Washington and in my opinion it should have remained the same. not because of the supposedly crude language but for an extremely drab storyline, a weak protagonist and simply for the fact that this book has nothing to offer to the reader. i am glad it was short and i could get it over with. the book is described as the symbol of teenage rebellion but all i thought it opposed was good writing. there are a lot of good books on teenagers like ""the curious incident of the dog at night time"". don't waste your time on this one. i cannot comprehend how someone can be inspired to shoot another person after reading this book.looks like lennon died for nothing. the only person I want to shoot is myself.. well better books await so no dying today!!"
1995,Bassel,I couldn't get past the halfway point. One of the most poorly written books I've ever read. The writing style is much too casual and mediocre.
1996,Vanessa,I am ashamed to say I skimmed this in high school so I thought I would read it cover-to-cover. Now I remember why I skimmed it so many years ago. Self indulgent nonsense. Not one I will recommend to my girls. 
1997,Reemi,zzz
1998,Jill,"I hated this book when I read it. Truth is that Salinger is beautiful writer, but I was so infuriated by attitudes and fears of the character that I wanted to throw the book out the window."
1999,Rob Rausch,"What a miserable and depressing book. It drove me crazy that Holden Caulfield spent the book wandering aimlessly, complaining about everything, mocking every adult, and refusing to abide by societal mores. Was the point supposed to be that Caulfield is precisely the type of ""phony"" he hates? One hopes that Salinger didn't really believe that Caulfield spoke for his generation."
2000,Margaret Jarocki,I did not enjoy this book! 
2001,Loraine,"Sorry. Didn't like it. Didn't finish it. Too much swearing and negative energy for me. I choose to spend my time with more pleasurable things that actually uplift me, don't drag me down. There's a difference between something that makes you ponder, think and understand, and something that's just negative."
2002,Isa Lavinia,"
 Yes, I know, this is the book that changed everyone's lives when they read it and how dare I, blah blah. Believe me, I heard it all.The thing is, Holden's personality is what holds the whole book together. Now, I know many (many! believe me!) people who identify with Holden, and admire his struggle and need to rebel against a hypocritical society. And then there are people (like me) who can't fucking stand Holden. So the book falls apart for those people.I read this book while I was in hospital, and to be honest, it was a very dark time for me and I wasn't really sure I was going to make it, but you guys have no idea how trivial, how ridiculously spoiled and self-absorbed Holden Caulfield seems to someone who reads him while going through some serious shit. I was supposed to be fighting for my life but I took moments aside to wish for his life to end!So, if you like this book, great! I'm always happy when people like books, even books I dislike, and I can't fault J.D. Salinger's writing in any way, it's Holden's character I hate. So this is one of those books that always makes me go, ""Really?"" but I understand that it's one that will have a different impact on the reader, depending on what place he or she is in life."
2003,Joel Ayala Alicea,"Well, I rated it one star solely because I couldn't give it less than that. This so- called ""life-changing"" story is no more than a bunch of cursing and schizofrenic rants of a sulky misanthropic teen, who despises everything and everyone but himself and his little sister. Totally overrated!"
2004,Melanie Archambeault,I hate hate hate this book. I had a co-worker say I reminded him of Holden McNeal and I almost punched him. Great American Classic my butt.
2005,Brittany,i DESPISE this book. i think the main character is whiny and annoying and the book as a whole is just terribly boring. not sure why everyone loves it so much.
2006,Stella,"I don't usually judge a book based on how much I like the main character. But when there is only one main character and he is nothing but a useless piece of garbage, it bothers me a bit. There is nothing likable about Holden and the whole book is based on him whining and being depressed, the ""plot"" is secondary and the story lacks any sort of a climax. I can't imagine how anyone could identify with Holden. Maybe I didn't get the point, it sometimes happens to me, but neither did I see any clever points in the story, nor it made me think deep thoughts. For me, it was just pain to read it. Most of the people writing reviews here say, that they probably read it when they were already too old for it; that it's a book for adolescents. But how young exactly do you have to be to enjoy it? I'll recommend it to my 13 years old sister to find out."
2007,Adriana,It was nothing special. The character was witty and an interesting guy but absolutely nothing happened. I don't understand the big whoop. 
2008,Krissina,"Let's just say that if I could punch one fictional character in history in the throat it would be Holden Caulfield. This kid is an entitled, spoiled brat who faces no consequences for his poor choices. His arrogance distracts from the situations that he ends up in while he is in NYC. Do yourself a favor read Perks of Being a Wallflower over this book, it is much more meaningful, and you can actually get to like the main character, rather than wanting to physically harm him."
2009,Erez Schatz,"It's a vibrant portrait of a teenager's angst-eaten soul. And as such is a droll recap of ""what I did last summer"", only with more cuss-words, too much of teen-angsty-not-really-deep musing and not that well written."
2010,Madison Wood,"I have never hated a book as much as I hate this one. 0 stars. It was terrible. First of all, I can't even imagine how many times I read the words ""phony"", ""goddam"", or ""...and all"". The vocabulary had me falling asleep and skipping lines because I was so bored.Secondly, Holden Caulfield is a little bitch. He's whiny, annoying, RUDE AS HELL, sexist, and homophobic. I have never hated a main character, but I can now say I do. What really threw me off this book was the fact that I COULD NOT stand the main character at all. I had to read this novel for english class, and I can honestly say I will never pick this book up ever again in my lifetime. I want to burn it. Seriously, it was torture. That's all. :)"
2011,Sydney Murphy,"I didnt like this book very much at all. I felt that Holden was a fake perso, and i didnt like his coockyness. He was selfcentered and fake when he would call others phonies. The ending made me upset because i thought there would be a drastict ending but that didn't catch my attention. The Catcher in the Rye was not my taste, and it had a negative vibe to be and i didnt connect well with it. "
2012,Deeksha Kapoor,I think this is one book I must re-read because I seem to have missed out on whatever everyone else goes on and on about. Probably I read it too early in life.. but at this point one star is all Ill give it.
2013,Jeremiah Lowry,"Holden is a complete train wreck.He drinkls, swears like a sailor and doesn't really live up to his potential. And he has an excuse for it, I suppose. Even when i learned that, I still couldn't say i liked Holden."
2014,Aldebree,"I HATED this book in high school. Holden Caulfield got on my last nerve. I know some people love it and it's a classic, but it was not my cup of tea."
2015,C,"I may be the only person in the world, but I did NOT like this book. It was twisted and depressing and I could not stand Holden."
2016,V1ct0r1a,Ugh! Whine whine whine... That is all the book one of the worst books ever! I would've burned it except I was forced to finish for a school essay. Do yourself a favor and don't even look at this book!
2017,Caitlinyee,"I read this book numerous times, for school and leisure. Based on the majority of hearsay that Catcher is a good book...it has to be one of the most I despise. Phony, phony, phony."
2018,Paula,"stream of conscious novel that was too introspective and random for my liking - which is what it was meant to be like, but I prefer a plot with more than one character who is so far up his own rear end he disappears"
2019,Foxhound15,The worst book I've ever read.
2020,Sara Wise,"I finally finished this book after trying countless times before to get through. It was annoying to me that, in my opinion, this was a non story. I guess I'm just not young or angst enough to understand the point. "
2021,Juli,"I didn't like this book in the least and am amazed at its ""classic"" status. Holden Caulfield is a nauseating little puke and I don't want to know anyone who can relate to him. I went on to read Franny & Zooey, which I found completely pointless. Why, for God's sake, is Salinger considered such an important writer?"
2022,David Hewitt,"Worst, Book, Ever.For reals. I read this short ""book"" twice and wrote a couple of papers on it, even comparing it unfavorably to Little Women. I hated Little Women and I would still rate it higher than J.D. Salinger's crap-fest.My reasoning for such a poor rating is simple: Catcher in the Rye has no beginning, middle, or end. Instead of a story it is a clumsy glimpse into the worthless life of the apathetic main character Holden Caulfield who leaves no mark and accomplishes nothing of value.I can't believe it when anyone says that they sympathize with Caulfield. That he ""speaks the things which they can't"". Every time I hear someone gushing about Catcher in the Rye and it's nonsensical ramblings a little part of me dies. Every time someone finishes this book and puts it down thoughtfully, tilting their head in mock understanding as they furrow their childish brows, Satan laughs and high fives J.D. Salinger amidst Hell's furious flames.When Catcher in the Rye is read aloud backwards from finish to start, it opens up an extra-dimensional portal where Lovecraftian horrors spew endlessly into our peaceful world. When it's read aloud forwards from start to finish, people fall asleep from boredom.Your evil twin loves Catcher in the Rye and twirls his or her's nefarious pencil thin mustache while reading it. They laugh their evil doppleganger laugh while thinking of evil ways to ruin your life thanks to J.D. Salinger.In his early days, Salinger pulled a thorn out of a witch's foot who granted him a wish, which was to write the great American novel. Unfortunately, the witch's foul magicks were encapsulated in the book, Catcher in the Rye and Salinger hung himself in shame immediately after it's publishing.I could literally go on and on for days like this. This book is awful and if you like it you're a putz.I'm sorry... it's just... I'm sorry."
2023,Bryan Ewert,"I don't get what all the fuss is about.This story reads like a school essay written by a 17-year-old who suffers from attention deficit disorder. Disjointed writing, clumsy dialog, and barely fleshed out characters.I grant it a star because it ends well. In fact, I rather enjoyed the penultimate chapter. As for the rest, I found it mostly just depressing."
2024,Yancy Coreas,"I did NOT like this book at all. Holden was always talking about how people was fake and whatever but the really phonie was him.He was very immature, and try to show people that he was very ""mature"" drinking alcohol and smoking."
2025,PJ,i didn't really like it and don't see why it's considered important.
2026,Deirdre White,"I had heard good things about this novel before I read it, and so I was quite looking forward to beginning, but sadly once I did I was sourly disappointed. I read this for my AP Language class, and had that not been the case then I never would have finished the book, in fact I would likely have stopped reading after a chapter or two.  The main character Holden Caulfield is an incredibly difficult person to like, he is hypocritical, whiny, and all around unpleasant. Any social critiques the author was attempting to make through this character were over shadowed by my complete and utter hatred for Holden, and any meaning I was able to dig out from his character was diluted and cliched. He certainly was provided traits which help to explain his miserable personality, the death of his brother and what seems to be some serious mental health issues, however I fail to feel any kind of empathy for him due to it, as he makes no effort to help himself, rather choosing to wallow in his hatred of others. So yes, his loss does help to explain his unpleasant personality, but many people have, and will, suffer loss but that is no excuse for acting cruelly to others. No one sees the mothers of dead soldiers going around stealing candy from babies, rather they often raise money in the names of their children, or else honor their memory in peaceful, kind ways. Holden could have made an effort to move past Allies death, he may never truly be capable of completely moving on, but he could have at least tried. He never tried. He was passive in his misery. The story was also lacking in plot; yes there was one, but just enough to give something to do. the ending was anticlimactic, and the story felt as though the author felt just as lost writing it as his main character felt living it. The author's perverted tendencies also appear in the book from time to time when relationships come up. Almost all interactions between men and women of a romantic variety end in some kind of abusive advance or another, trending into territory which could very easily be interpreted as rape at times. I also had issue with the encounter between Holden and his old English teacher petting his head, as Salinger writes of his character having experienced similar situations before and his dislike of them, of perverts, and yet the author himself is more then capable of playing the role of Mr. Anotlini. All-in-all, the only thing I gained from this book was knowledge of a bit of 1950s gay slang, as well as a large waste of my time. edit** The author also has no concept of show more, tell less. "
2027,Hi I'm Bob,"I'm not sure what to think of this novel. I was a bit underwhelmed in light of the incredible acclaim surrounding The Catcher in the Rye. My expectations worked against my ability to simply enjoy what I was reading, and the narrator of the story did not much aid this. Frankly, for most of the book Holder just seemed such a cynical, whiny, and privileged little brat that I was unable to sympathize with him. However, as one might expect of a coming-of-age novel, Holder eventually shows signs of emotional growth after (view spoiler)[a conversation with a former teacher and a few encounters with his kid sister, (hide spoiler)] making him a more tollerable protagonist. The subtlety with which Salinger shows the different facets of his protagonist's personality and the nuggets of philosophical gold hidden in Holder's defining moments make the book worth reading. I just wish it weren't told from the perspective of such a pessimistic little sissy. Perhaps I should have read this in my teen years, in order to properly appreciate it. Overall it was ok; it had its moments of entertainment and profundity with a chuckle here and there. I'll re-read it eventually and probably enjoy it more with lowered expectations."
2028,Markus Jevring,"""One of the classics"", of course I had to read it. This book was so bad I didn't even finish. I simply could not stand the fact that the author wrote like he was a 16-year-old who's full of himself. I've heard it said that this was intentional, but it just came across as incredibly bad writing. This is a horrible piece of shit, and you should avoid it at all costs."
2029,John Soleimanian,"Some whiny teenager complains about everything and has half-assed opinions, and blows everything out of proportion. But, there are a couple of swear words in there."
2030,Dinah,"Did not enjoy this book. I expected a lot more out of it. not the rambling of a depressed teenage boy. I barely made it through. The first 3/4 was annoying, but the last bit was OK and I started to like Holden a bit."
2031,Brianne Kreppein,I was never an angsty enough teen to enjoy this.
2032,Race,Almost painful to read. Shows flashes of brilliance but it's not sufficient to sustain interest or engage or concentrate on. It took me half a mth to finish 190++ pages
2033,Offauna,"I just don't understand what people see in this book. Holden Holden Holden first he's a pathological liar, next he's annoying as hell, he says he'll do something then never do it claiming he's not in the ""mood"", next he's a mean person he's always calling someone ugly. Then he's literally as phony as all those people he complains about he's also the type of guy who's never satisfied with anything it's either too good or not good, nothing's ever good enough for him. Then he's also repetitive, I feel like I'm listening to my mother when she says things over and over again I'm like I heard you the first second and third time you said it. He also exaggerates things. Holden is just a miserable person and I can't count the amount of times I rolled my eyes at this book. Oh and I kept waiting for the climax of this book, where the hell was it? The way my prof described it death, he gets beat up and sex. I'm like his brother died that was sad but getting beat up he brought that upon himself if he wasn't stupid and stopped taunting people when they told him they were going to beat him up it wouldn't have happened. And sex what sex he didn't have any. Holden is just a little boy who likes to complain about the world and not do anything, I just wanted him to shut the fuck up. I thought I hated books before but the more I think about this book the angrier I get. "
2034,Scott Sapp,"Overrated.. and based on a whiny teen who can't deal with his privileged life. I know there's underlining morality, but didn't care and didn't like it...Just me"
2035,Maggie,Read it 3 or 4 times over the years and I just can't wrap my head around it. Don't enjoy the writing style or the story line.
2036,Paul Bryant,"Paul wrote: ""if you can't emotionally one-star on Goodreads, then where can you?""Right! I have put up emotional reviews (it's 2-star, BTW)for both this book and The Great Gatsby. I am currently on the lookout for other classics I can one-star."
2037,abbylee Oqueli,"I know this is a classic and loved by many, but it was just way too dark, cynical, and slow for me. I kept waiting for something to happen, and was sorely disappointed when I read the last two pages, only to be told that there was no more to the story because Holden didn't feel like telling anymore of it. I was left with more questions than answers, was frustrated by the plotless nature of the piece, and had a hard time buying into a main character that I didn't find very likable."
2038,Ivy,"I can recall reading this as a required assignment in high school. At the time, I had almost no connection to the main character and found it overly sentimental and broody."
2039,Emily Curtice,"WHY IS THIS BOOK A CLASSIC?!?!? Really the main character just rambles on and on and on! 1 paragraph can be up to 2 pages! It really had no meaning and I hated it. I really don't get why people rave over it so much. I felt like I was reading someone's random, crazy, jumbled up thoughts. And not in a good/interesting way. BORING. "
2040,Judith Wrinkle,"Though a classic, I guess I just didn't get it. I felt it was a harbinger of things to come and sadly..........true......."
2041,Tari,"This book much not worth my time and I didn't want to read, but I wasn't given a choice in high school. I didn't appreciate the bad language, sexual content, or drug/alcohol content that was in this book. All the above was about a teenage boy at boarding school."
2042,César,"No entiendo porque este libro es famoso. Historia floja, al igual que su estilo narrativo. Me recordó muchísimo a Manolito Gafotas, solo que a la americana."
2043,Chriss,"277 pages of a lazy guy whining that the world is a bad place. Had to read it for high school. Wouldn't have otherwise. There are better books with the same theme. Not sure why this one has such a cherished place in literature. Different strokes for different folks, I suppose."
2044,Alexa M,"It's well-written, but it bored me half to death. I was expecting something worthwhile to happen and it just ends being this kid who complains about everything. No wonder there's no summary on the back of the book. Ha!"
2045,Hep,i hate this book so fkn much. 
2046,Rachelccameron,"Now I can say I have read this book start to finish and I can officially give it the one star it deserves.My god, what a stupid book. Holden is irritating and difficult to relate to. He is stupid and the way he explains and then re-explains things is very annoying. The style is old- fashioned and not well done. The fact that students still have to read this book in schools is ridiculous. I don't know how this can be considered a crowning achievement in modern literature.If ever I would participate in a book burning, this would be the one I would chuck in the fire."
2047,Becky Smith,Pretentious terrible garbage
2048,Camila Romero,"I've started this book about twenty times, because it's a classical and you have to read it.I. cannot. finish. it.I find the main character so annoying and the writing drives me crazy. I've come to peace that I'll never finish it."
2049,Hpitcher,"This book has ruined all sayings like ""____ as hell."" Seriously! I read a book the other day and someone said ""scared as hell"" and all i could do was hear Holden Caulfields voice in my head. The saying would be completely normal in a book if I hadn't just read this one because when you hear the saying every second sentence it starts to get to you. I hated this book so very much. The main character was a terrible person who seriously needed to shut up because no one cares that he thinks every single person in the world is a PHONY! He has to stop being such a creaking hypocrite because he is worse than every other character in the entire novel. It really annoyed me. Or should I say it annoyed the hell out of me, it really did."
2050,Lot,"Were books appropriate media for drinking games, this one would be amazing. Take a shot every time something is confirmed for a second time (e.g., 'She really did.' 'I really didn't.' 'I swear I did.' 'I really was.'). Bonus points if you finish the book without dying.I personally didn't like this book much. It's an easy read and some parts got me chuckling, but I'm the kinda gal that wants a story to build up to something. A conclusion, or a giant plot-twist, a life-lesson, something, anything. The Catcher in the Rye is more of a recording of a few days, and the memories those days have brought. Hardly any character that is introduced brings any value to the story. It could very well be that I just stupidly missed a symbolical point of the book, but until I am pointed out to one, I'm gonna have to stick with only two stars."
2051,Alissa McGowan,"I know I'm in the minority, but I really hate The Catcher in the Rye. Holden Caulfield is the most annoying narrator I have ever had the displeasure to encounter, and I spent the entire novel hoping he would go ahead and kill himself already so he would shut up and stop whining. "
2052,Fatma,"I tried liking this book, I really did, but Holden (the main character) was way too irritating to handle (swears and lies way too much). He hated everyone and everything around him, which made me hate him and the book.The writing was crap. There, I said it. I'm sorry, but it's too repetitive! I wanted to get this book over with from the first chapter. I was hoping an interesting twist would pop up...... but nope! Nothing.This book fails on so many levels. A waste of my time. A waste of paper. A waste of ink."
2053,Lily,"No me voy a poner a explicar lo poco que me ha gustado este libro y todo lo que me ha decepcionado.Holden es el peor personaje del que he leído. Si lo suyo es el paso de la adolescencia a la edad adulta, yo no he sido adolescente y si este es un clásico moderno de prácticamente obligada lectura no entiendo quién lo catalogó de esa manera, porque creo que tengo recorrido literario suficiente como para saber que esto merece ser quemado en la hoguera"
2054,Amy O'tinger,"I've made it a point to go back and read the classics. So I got my hands on a copy of Catcher in the Rye. It was so well-recommended, I thought I was in for something great. But I was sorely disappointed. I found the main character to be distasteful and I cared not a bit at all what happened to him or why this book is a classic. It has been a few years now since I read it, and I'm still trying to figure out why anyone cares at all about this book."
2055,Leena,"Released in 1951, I see why this would have been controversial. The language was quite surprising and raw (read sweary) specially from a 16 year old protagonist. Ideally should be read before you hit your mid 20s or you'll feel compelled to slap young Holden Caulfield every 5 minutes for his poor choices."
2056,Marita ,Bad language of a teenage boy. I could not relate even if I had some sympaty for the boys experiances. Hard to believe it was written 1945 seemed quite current.
2057,Pokeyann,"This was the worst book I've ever read. Maybe when it came out many a decade ago it was most likely very shocking and all sorts of crazy. But I think this book is just plain crazy. I suffered through the whole thing just to say that I've read this ridiculous classic. I will never understand why it's a classic. If the editors don't care enough to even correct numerous errors, why in the world are we all reading it?! And whoever thought this should be a read for high schoolers is a few screws loose."
2058,Louise,I have no idea why this book is so highly regarded. I sat down and read it one afternoon. I kept on reading doggedly to the end expecting something but was mistaken. A dirge of a book following the inner monologue of a tedious and dull boy. Dreadful. What a waste of my valuable reading time.
2059,Jimmit Shah,"One of the things that I enjoyed most after reading this book is reading the reviews about the book. I have not had so much going through people’s comments about a book for any other book till now. Some of it was really hilarious. There are people who consider it trash and an epic waste of their time and there are people who can’t seem to stop praising it. I am more inclined to side with the former set.Here’s what is good about the book: Teenage despondency, hating adult world and the deep seated urge to be a child or be back playing with children. The author portrays these really well. The not-so-good bits: The slang...it’s edgy – makes you want to throw away the book. The story – good in bits and pieces but it is all over the place. There are so many points in the story where I want to shout out “Digression!”. The inconsistency – the language of Holden changes from the first half to the second half – in first half he repeats the words ‘goddamn’ or ‘phony’ or ‘moron’ so many times while in the second half even under duress he doesn’t mention those words often enough (don’t get me wrong here- it was relief not reading those words again and again but the lack of consistency is a bit jarring) . Main flaw: the character – The protagonist doesn’t have any depth at all. He is a typical teenage shallow kid with high flung opinions about everything. In a book I like to see character development or some small change in the character. There is nothing about Holden that changes. Overall the story/language/book leaves me miffed. I guess I am a decade too late in reading the book. It is a book for teenagers at best. "
2060,Aletha Hickey,"I re-read this thinking I would realize why it was required reading in high school. It was a sad story, primarily because the teenage boy was chronically depressed and cussed his way through the book. I'm glad teenagers aren't required to read this now."
2061,Meera,"Something really annoyed me about this book. Not sure what. Apparently its strength lies in its ability to portray young people relatably and understandably but I found the narrator (Holden) to be very hypocritical and unrelatable. He gave off the ""special snowflake"" vibe, as if because he was not like most guys he was so much better than them. So a lot of the novel was just his rants about how stupid random things were. Which I guess may make sense for something from a teenager's perspective but grew very tiring after a while, and even started to feel a little immature. He would either call somebody ""phony"" or say he liked them for their honest qualities. I really didn’t like him as a character. It was almost as if he was trying too hard to be universal— as if because he was bad at everything everyone must be able to relate to at least something in his character. I like characters who I can admire for at least something- for overcoming adversity, for their ability to love something, for anything at all, but Holden just sort of gives up on everything. As the reader learns more and more about how apathetic Holden is and how little he cares about most things the draw of the novel disintegrates a little. There's no reason to keep reading other than mild curiosity about what happens next. The ending didn't feel very thought out either, and he didn't seem to overcome any of his problems. It felt like a filler. The only thing that Salinger explains well is perhaps the misguided anger that many teenagers feel. However even that is portrayed mediocrely- all Salinger does is explain that it’s there. Not what to do with it, or how to get through it, just that it’s there. I read another Goodreads review that called reactions to this book very polar and I think that holds true. Maybe I just fell on the wrong side of the spectrum. "
2062,Sandra,"Just too strange without any real purpose or explanation of his behavior. Is this peering into the personality of Salinger himself? I remember the day he died. A mom was here for playgroup who worked for Salinger's ""romance interest"". I knew before the general public knew of his passing. What a strange, strange man..."
2063,Delaney Butterfield,"I don't get this book. I don't understand how people can be so amazed by ""Salinger's masterpiece."" I mean, what is so outstanding about this book? Is it because Holden Caulfield is just too admirable and inspirational, being a whiny rich kid who flunked out of high school? Is it because of the wonderful storyline? Because I don't understand what's so great about a kid whining about his family and wandering the city after he got kicked out of yet another boarding school. Salinger's writing style isn't even that great. It was basic and not extraordinary. I liked all the characters except Holden. The rest of them were actually interesting and I wanted more of them. But Holden drove me crazy. As I mentioned earlier, all he did was whine about how his life sucked because he flunked out of yet another school, and he tried to show off how rich he was and he just drove me crazy. I didn't want to hate this book as much as I do, but I do an I understand that ""hate"" is a strong word, but I just really don't understand the hype and the praise for this book as it is just about an over privileged whiny rich kid. "
2064,Elisabeth Cohen,"I read this b/c I was trying to read every classic book from a list- I didn't enjoy the narrators horrible attitude. He was a big jerk.... I guess its on all of those lists b/c its writing style and ""voice"" were so unique."
2065,Lynda,"It is a classic but the main character is a turd and just needs to grow up. Reading when you are a teen, it seems great. But now as an adult, it just annoyed me. "
2066,Brett Pierce,"Had to read at school, and found myself stuck inside the brain of some idiot and screaming inside my own mind to escape. You know those mad scientist's contraptions where you put on the skull cap and swap brains with a monkey? That is this book. The ducks and the ice. He was going on about ducks and ice, I think that may have even been the highlight and this sentiment hasn't really added anything of value to my life. "
2067,Sharifah,"I think those who could not relate to the main character will find this book to be overrated. It was such a long and draggy storyline - half of the book was only about the first two days! The whole concept of the book was about the main character; he tells us directly ALL his stories and thoughts. I extremely find it annoying how he EASILY gets distracted. Most of the time it was so boring that I had to skip a whole page of him babbling before he gets back to talking what he really wants to convey. Holden Caulfield. Sometimes I enjoy his sense of humour. I find it amusing how he constantly repeat these words throughout the book: phony, helluva, Chrissake, old Stradlater, killed me, for God's sake, drives me crazy. Holden was quite setimental too - the part when he hung the prostitute's outfit and when he thought about the nuns collecting charity. Simple things can make him depressed such as seeing a wet bench at the park. J.D Salinger did not use any fancy words in the book so it was easy to understand. I did enjoy the first quarter of the book and that was before he got kicked out of school. After that, there was not much going on - no plot at all. Overall, my expectations were high before I started reading it and yes, I am quite dissapointed with its ending"
2068,Sarah Hillgrove,"I actually only made it about halfway through this book before I got fed up and put it away. There's just way too much cursing for me to ignore. It appears in almost every sentence in the beginning, then kind of mellows out but it never goes away entirely. I guess if you're not bothered by that sort of thing you'd probably enjoy this book, but I couldn't get past it- it was just too distracting and irritating."
2069,Emilee,"Am I the only one who sees the irony in that Holden hates the so-called ""phonies"", and yet he is the biggest phony himself? Normally, I appreciate irony and satire when it's used to comment on the state of our society, but in this case, I think it was unintentional and misused, at best. At it's best, Catcher is the story of a typical teenager who can't appreciate how good of a hand life has dealt him. Also, so much for being a unique voice to a certain age group or generation - go read Perks of Being a Wallflower and try to tell me that Charlie isn't Holden reincarnated into the early '90s. Sorry, hipsters, I'm sitting out on this one."
2070,Chandra,This is a fantastic book if you want to be stuck in a 16 year old boys head for a day and a half. I've heard this is supposed to be a classic..... apparently I have terrible taste.
2071,Sarah Steele,"I really wanted to like it, but all it was was whining. I have hated very few books in my lifetime, and this is one of them."
2072,Alisa,"I read this in high school and hated it, but thought I'd give it another try. Still hate it. I actually didn't even finish. I just don't like the style of the writing. It's distracting. "
2073,Tiaan van der Merwe,"Catcher fails across the board. Crunmy characters, unbelievable situations, terrible storytelling, no subtlety."
2074,Ana,"I know its a classic and all but I simply didn't like itHe's a whinny brat. Okay, so he's got issues. Don't we all? Common'!"
2075,Jillian,"I know this is considered a classic, but I found the constant, dizzying moving about through the main character's mind and the persistent use of God's name in vain to be a sincere turnoff. "
2076,Ann,A tedious read of the unravelling mind of teenager Holden Caulfield. It is rambling and repetitive and truly boring. 
2077,Angela Smith,I may have missed something in this book. It's probably a bad sign when you hope that the main character in the book dies. 
2078,Hanaa,wow! all that book learnin you mentioned sure make you sound smart. I dont really care about your academics. and its fine if you dont care for the book. I was just mentioning the unreliable narrator for those who did not realize it. a clockwork orange is an incredible book though. one of my favorites.
2079,Rally,"Having been forced to read this book in High School, I only remember how much I hated it. I felt that the protagonist was the most annoying, obnoxious character I had ever had to endure. Perhaps one day I will read this again, and see if I feel differently about it."
2080,Angelmira,"iam so glad i got through this book. like i can't even tell you how much i wanted this book to be over. i didn't like the main character, Holden. i think he was a pathological liar and unstable piece of shit. but at the same time, maybe it's because i'm over thirty years old and he was only seventeen.what is really fascinating to me is, Mr. Salinger wrote this book in 1945. and no one would knew. the book was very ""up to date"" to me. and i was very impressed by this. "
2081,Michael Matthews,"I am at a loss as to the popularity of this book. Don't like first person POV to begin with and then found the story pointless. The main character was an idiot and had a simpleton's view of the world-- which quickly answered the unasked question why unremarkable people are rarely the subject of books or movies.Salinger does an incredible job of portraying the character's perspective and it feels like you're reading his personal thoughts, but it was not an entertaining experience."
2082,Shona,"This book was utter crap. I have had it on my ""to read"" list for ages and finally thought I would go ahead and read it at last. I expected great things but was sorely disappointed when I?started to read this. Each time I picked it up I thought maybe if I give it a few more pages it will improve but again I was let down.Did I miss the exciting parts? The clinching few paragraphs? or was this just a waste of paper."
2083,Lucila Del Rosario,We read this book in our 11th grade English class and it was very bland to me. The whole book was told from a pessimistic perspective. 
2084,Olivia Alaimo,"The Catcher in the Rye was the worst book I have ever read. I think that it was a really boring book, that was hard to read. I would not recommend this book to anyone who likes to read because it’s boring. 	This book is bad because, it is hard to understand in the beginning and I feel like it doesn’t have a point to the book. But I think schools teach this book and have kids read them because, it’s talking about teenagers and how he was trying to find himself.I would connect this book to Animal Farm, we read freshman year. I would connect this because it’s boring also but has a good message to the book if you actually read it. "
2085,Draven,"I know it's a classic but it left me apathetic. It's not the fault so much of the writing as I truly think this is a book better understood by men. To use a cliche, ""it really is a guy thing""."
2086,P.Sannie,"Like many Americans, I had to read this in high school. I had high expectations because everyone I knew who had read it said it was a great coming-of-age novel. After the first chapter, I was beyond disappointed. I didn't even get past the second chapter. Why? Because Holden Caulfield is a selfish, spoiled, first-class a-hole. I don't recall the exact details since I read this so long ago (or what I read was so long ago), but I just remember not being able to deal with his whining and complaining about everything. He badmouths literally everything in his life, yet, he does nothing to change it. The character is so completely negative that I read the last chapter to see if anything had changed and nope, nothing did. He was still the same person he was in the beginning. I really couldn't get through the book.In fact, I actually wrote a paper about why I didn't finish the book. My English teacher was shocked that I did because he had never gotten anything like that before. However, it was pretty much about how after the first chapter I couldn't read any further. But that pretty much sums up my feeling towards this book."
2087,Aunbrey Parker,"Je n'ai jamais réussi à entrer dans l'histoire. Je n'ai jamais réussi à accrocher au style d'écriture de l'auteur. Je n'ai jamais réussi à apprécier le personnage principal. Le seul mot qui me vient à l'esprit pour décrire cette lecture et l'atmosphère générale du livre : « Insupportable ».Holden est imbuvable. Je n'ai jamais vu un personnage aussi mécontent. Il n'est satisfait de rien, il n'aime rien, ni personne, il est immature au possible, vulgaire et complètement inconscient.Il est impossible, voir inenvisageable de compatir avec lui, de comprendre ce qu'il vit. C'est le genre de personnage, tête à claques par excellence et difficile à aimer ou même à essayer de comprendre (selon mes critères).Le style d'écriture de l'auteur est dur à suivre, contradictoire d'une phrase à l'autre. Lorsque je lisais le cheminement des pensées de Holden, j'avais l'impression d'avoir un gamin hyperactif en face de moi, qui ne tient pas en place, qui fait des commentaires sur tout et n'importe quoi, même quand il devrait s'abstenir. Il change d'avis d'un paragraphe à l'autre, c'est épuisant. Il n'aime pas tel personnage ou n'a pas envie de parler de telle personne, il en parle quand même. Je ne comprends pas sa logique. De plus, l'auteur a opté pour un style de narration oral. On lit des tournures de phrase qui ne se disent qu'à l'oral, on retrouve des tics de langage typiques d'une expression orale, les « hein » ou « tu vois » que Holden n'hésite pas à placer dans chacune de ses phrases. Je ne sais pas si ce procédé a été utilisé pour permettre au lecteur de s'identifier plus facilement au personnage, de rentrer plus facilement dans sa tête, mais dans mon cas, ça a échoué lamentablement.Je peux bien comprendre que ça illustre l'adolescence d'un jeune homme qui n'a pas encore trouvé sa place dans le monde, qui ne sait pas ce qu'il veut faire, qui se sent mal dans sa peau mais tout de même, son côté capricieux et « je veux me la jouer cool » est épouvantable.Conclusion, une lecture que je suis bien contente d'avoir terminé pour passer à autre chose de beaucoup plus intéressant et moins frustrant pour l'esprit ! "
2088,Laura,"I didn't even finish it- got about 100 pages into it and got so sick of Holden Caulfield that I abandoned it, which is very unusual for me. "
2089,Becky,"I hate this book. From start to finish I couldn't find anything redeeming about this ""classic."" Maybe I am too old to identify with Holden, or maybe I don't have enough sympathy for what he is going though...either way, I just couldn't stand it. I am happy to strike another ""must read"" book off my list. "
2090,Megan Tristao,"Honestly, I'd love to give this book 2.5 stars, but that's not an option, so I'll be generous and round up to three. Things I liked: Sometimes Holden made brilliant observations, like when he talked about people who WANT to go to the movies. J.D. Salinger also did a great job getting into Holden's head and having a consistent style of narration. Things I disliked: The style of narration. I know it was supposed to be Holden's stream of consciousness, but I got annoyed when he would repeat thoughts in the same quote. I also didn't feel satisfied at the end of the book; I didn't feel like anything was resolved or that there had been a distinct plot. I'm sure Salinger didn't intend there to be, but it left me feeling incomplete. Hence, a solid middle-of-the-road rating."
2091,Fatima kiyan,من زیاد از این کتاب خوشم نیومد و کارهای هولدن برام عجیب بود و اذیتم میکرد
2092,Beau,"junk. lot's of pointless language. the story rambled. i liked a couple of parts, but overall most of the book was a waste of time.i loved the way the opening page was written. caufield starts off saying the reader probably wants some background on the main character, but he's doesn't feel like going into it. very original opening that made me laugh. i also enjoyed it when one of caufield's classmates farts in the middle of a talk by ossenburger (a school donor who is full of himself). i couldn't stop laughing. caufield couldn't stand the guy. i've felt much the same way when i'm around someone thinks highly of themselves.i didn't like caufield's feelings on the disciples of Jesus Christ. and the scene with mr. antolini was nauseating. caufield's reaction was perfect though. you could feel the sickness in his stomach. the tempo of the book picked up really fast at that point making you feel caufield's sense of helplessness and desire to escape.don't waste your time though."
2093,Hunter,"I have a B.A. and an M.A. in English literature and I had never been assigned to read this book. I figured I'd give it a go since it's such a cultural touchstone, and boy was I disappointed. There was nothing to like here. Boring characters, no plot, and I wanted to stab Holden in the eye for being so annoying. Maybe if I'd read this as a teenager I'd appreciate the angst more, but now I just find it tiring."
2094,Kerrie,"I did not like this book what-so-ever.It's not often I read a book where I can barely think of ONE good, interesting part.I spent most of the book wishing I could strangle the main character, who was unbelievably and painfully repetitive and dull.I was told that this book was ""relatable"" for teens, I'm a 15 year old girl but I couldn't relate to it in any way. The only thing I liked about and understood in the book was Holden's love for his sister. Besides that? It sucked, there was no climax at ALL and the main character made me want to go pull my hair out."
2095,Jacqueline Smith,overrated. To put it simply a easy comparison would be if you were to read a book about a young youth growing up in the ghetto written by a middle aged white women in the mid west. I wanted to throw this book in traffic when I was finished with it. I can't understand why this is considered a great classic.
2096,Christy,"Bratty child complains, curses, whines, and generally acts like a juvenile delinquent. What, please, is so wonderful about this classic?"
2097,Marcus,"This is a book that everyone believes that they should read, and as has happened too often in my life, I have found that one should only read the books that are written for oneself. And, indeed, this weak, thin novel has nothing to say to me. I cannot imagine why people like this book; I can only conjecture that if one reads it as a teenager it has more power, owing perhaps to the reader being the same age as the protagonist. "
2098,Alma,"
Summary
This is a ""classic"" in the US - read: everyone had to read it in school. I will therefore not recount the details of the book. If I must put a one sentence summary to it, here it is: Annoying, angsty teenage boy spends several days wandering through NYC, thinking about running away from home, finally caves and goes back home; existential mid-teenagerhood crisis averted. #yupthatssarcasm
Thoughts on the Book
Other people have said it far better than me on here, so I won't wax on forever - this book just failed to capture my interest. I thought initially it was the fact that I read it when the intricacies of the English language, in particular American English vernacular of the pre-WW II years escaped my full understanding. Then I considered it was because it was a school book after all. Then, after reading the wiki summary again because I couldn't for the love of me remember any single detail that stood out as I wanted to write up a summary for my ""Books Read Journal"" (I admit, I took the shortcut instead of picking up the darn thing again), I realized it. As the plot of the story came flooding back to me, I realized that Holden was just an annoying little ***. He had all the traits that my generation likes to throw at the millennials when we attempt to insult them - he embodied that whole, acting self-important and know-it-all attitude that all teenagers go through and that adults find ridiculously annoying. I don't know why I didn't care for that when I was a teenager myself. I know I had that phase in my life as well, but maybe I was already past it when I read this book or something? Maybe because Holden's life seemed (to me at that time at least, even tho I believe in the beginning he claims his life was rotten as a child) to be that of a privileged brat who's wasting the opportunities set before him. Maybe it was his whole he's ""oh-so-special"" and different than the guys his age schtick. I just couldn't relate to that. (And in retrospect, I remember even then thinking that him being all ""I'm so galant to women, while hormonal boys are such a-holes"" attitude was so pseudo-holier-than-thou that it was beyond annoying. In today's world, he'd be the closet-sexist dude, who is upset that girls always ""friend-zone"" him even though he's such a ""nice"" guy...urgh!)I honestly couldn't relate to anything he was going through or thinking about when I first read this. His melancholy meandering, both figurative and literal, utterly failed to make sense to me. Maybe because I am generally a positive person, maybe because the 1940s of the US were not interesting from a popular culture perspective to me...maybe because I read things like the Color Purple around the same time, which was far more fascinating.Anyway, today, I just see it as yet another school assignment I had. I can't praise it, but I can't say I hated it the way I hated Old Man and the Sea. I can honestly say the best word that describes my attitude for this book is ""Meh."" "
2099,Symone,"This book completely drove me nuts.Holden complained about everything, and overall was a very negative person."
2100,Andrew Grisdale,Read this years ago. I hated it. Whiny little git!
2101,Gemma Smith,"UGHHH.that is the only word that comes to mind when i think of this book. mind you, i didn't read this out of my own free will, it was required reading in high school and i kid you not when i say this, i.hated.every. moment.of.it. holden holden holden... could you be any more annoying? absolutely found the main character (who i take, as a reader i was suppose to root for?) pathetically boring and i felt like the entire book was nothing but a endlessly dry plateau of his stupid ""adventures"". "
2102,Katy Brandes,"What's all the hubub, Bub? Maybe it's a coming-of-age thing from '60s nostalgia of a time past, but I don't get it. Holden was annoying, but it was not just that. I expected so much more, and sometimes hyped expectations are disappointing. Maybe I should have read it earlier in my life to appreciate the angst.I need to re-approach this book some other time in hopes my disappointment was about timing. "
2103,Greg,"Another book that was required in a high school class, and with even less redeeming value (IMHO) than Lord of the Flies. At least the latter held some sociological insight. ""Catcher"" left me with a dark and unsettled feeling, and I have felt no desire whatsoever to return to it in the intervening decades, or to subject my children or friends to it through any sort of recommendation. "
2104,Lizette,"I really did not enjoy this book. I kept waiting for something to happen.... and nothing. From what I recall, Holden Caulfield basically bitches about everything and everyone. Nothing makes him happy and he doesn't seem to do anything about it either. I just have no time for bitter people."
2105,Haley Hatfield ,"The reason that I gave Catcher in the Rye only one star is because I didn't really think much of the book. The fact that Holden Caulfield is always complaining, calling people phonies, etc. is just annoying. This is what really made me not like the book, because the book is all about Holden and him complaning about his life. I think that I would like this book better if Holden had a different personalitly. "
2106,Aimee Ward,I cannot understand why people love this book. I found it dull and boring. 
2107,Bayan,"This book killed me. It really did. I mean it really did. You take a guy like Holden, he thinks everyone and every action is phony. He doesn't like anybody or anything or anything people do. I mean, really, you can sum up this book with a few words. ""phony"", ""Boy,"" ""Goddam"", ""It killed me."", ""you take a guy like.."" repeated again and again and again! I mean COME ON! if that's the way I thought when I was a teenager I'll just go and commit suicide right now! Seriously, if anybody got the lesson behind this torturous story, please enlighten me, because I'm too blind to see it. Although I have tried very hard to find some essence in it but to no avail. Not to mention that this book has a way of ruining your language. like he keeps speaking in the exact same manner that by the time you finish the book you talk like him! You know what really bothered me though? all that blabbering about phonies? yeah, well he's the phoniest of them all. There's really no essence in him. Unless that's the real theme in it, what with him being a lost adolescent and blah blah blah. I don't care. Shut up, Holden. I hate you."
2108,16tambascior,"J. D. Salinger's novel, The Catcher in the Rye, had a few problems in it. Firstly, the plot was often confusing and difficult to follow. Secondly, most of the narration and dialogue contains swears and sentences that either made little sense or were unnecessary. I would not recommend this book, even as a piece of classic literature."
2109,Mitchell,For years I've owned a copy of The Catcher in the Rye and I was positive I had read it and liked it a lot. So I figure I was rereading it. And I was wrong. I don't know what I thought I had read in the past but it certainly wasn't this book. There's no way I would have read this and not remembered a single detail. And I hated this book. It was awful and pointless. And yes perhaps not being an adolescent I no longer am anywhere near the target audience but ugh. Holden had nothing to say and really seemed to see no point to anything and that wasn't enough for me.
2110,Laura Figueredo,I would give this drivel 0 stars if possible.
2111,Kristen,"I have read this book, twice. At two different ages and I still dont get it. Can someone explain to me why this book is such a masterpiece?"
2112,JackieB,"Holden Caulfield must be be the whiniest, most self pitying ""hero"" ever depicted in a novel. To be honest I didn't get the point of this novel. A spoilt rich brat thinks he's having a hard time at his exclusive school so he runs away and books himself into a hotel. Then he tries showing off at various social events with results that would be embarrassing except his ego is too large to permit that. Finally things get a bit tough so he goes home. There is no evidence that he has learnt anything about himself or life as a result of these experiences. However, it did give me the biggest laugh I have ever had on reading a book. It was the part where he said Romeo and Juliet are pretty annoying. That made me laugh so much I nearly wet myself. Perhaps this is not the book to read if you are no longer a teenager, or even more so, if your job brings you into contact with teenagers who are living on the street because they prefer that to going back to their abusive homes."
2113,Sarah  Kay,"Fist of all, my english teacher told me this book wasgoing to be amazing,full of symbolism and all. i found this book to be the most annoying, uninteresting and plainirking book i have ever read. At times, I felt like throwing the book against the wall and shouting at Holden. I mean, i'm a teenager, yet i cant relate to Holden at all. The book was filled with the fact that everyone is a phony and Holden was constantly contradicting himself. I can't even come to imagine why people put this is a must read. "
2114,Julie,hated it. i dont exactly know why but i thought this book was so ridiculously boring. but i might read it again some other time because of such great reviews and i'll see if I misjudged it the first time i read this book. 
2115,Eliza Lloyd,"Someday I hope to understand why The Catcher in the Rye and Fifty Shades of Grey sold more than 100 copies.As far as TCitR, I believe it is the most highly overrated book of all time. It was a struggle to read and Holden was a dumb**s. What was the point?"
2116,Suchitra,I really could not understand how it was such a popular book. I found it ok and I had to struggle a bit to finish it.
2117,Julia,The whole book was just a guy ranting with swear words on how much his life sucked i personally didn't like it
2118,Rebeka Griffiths,"I have to say this is one of two books I passionately disliked. I can usually manage to find a redeeming feature in a book or in the main character but not in this case. The only thing I recall is the suicide, and the fact that at one point I was in love with a Holden. >_< yuck! "
2119,Bokabud,"No pude con este libro, y no entiendo cómo puede ser considerado un clásico de la literatura. Quizás fue rompedor cuando se publicó por el vocabulario y el carácter del protagonista, pero a mí me ha parecido, en pocas palabras, infumable.La historia trata sobre nuestro queridísimo amigo Holden Caulfield. Adolescente estereotipado. Vamos, que nadie le comprende, que lo sabe todo todito, que se deprime y se anima en cuestión de segundos, que quiere huir de todo. VALE. LO HEMOS COGIDO, Salinger. A medida que el libro avanza el personaje no hace más que hilar pensamientos de este tipo con otros un poco más aleatorios, mientras desfilan variopintos personajes que no añaden nada a la historia.Al estar escrito en primera persona, Holden no es presentado ni bueno ni malo, simplemente es así. Exasperante y repetitivo. Es una lectura amena, sí, que representa la indecisión y el hedonismo adolescente, pero ya está. Un personaje que no para de quejarse de lo falso e hipócrita que es el mundo. Un chico que no puede hacerse amigo de un chico por unas maletas de baja categoría.Ya se lo dice su propia hermana: ""No te gusta nada de nada"". Pues eso."
2120,Gwen Baird,"This book was so boring. There was literally no plot to it, the ending was terrible and it didn't conclude anything and the whole time Holden was rude and didn't do anything. This was one of the worst books I've ever read"
2121,Nocks,"Do Not Read! (disregard if you're a phony who thinks reading books like these makes you superior)Spare yourself and avoid this awful book like the plague. Reading The Catcher In The Rye was pure torture. How I even managed to finish it is still a mystery to me.Meet Holden Caulfield. The worst book protagonist in history! Holden, who after getting kicked out of his preppy private school wanders the streets of New York doing some introspective and judging society to pass time.  Holden This book could've had potential if not for Holden. I understand the direction that J.D Salinger was going for being an emo person myself. Yes, society is flawed and most people confirm to what society deems to be the norm which yes makes them phonies but Holden Caulfield was not the right character to narrate this issue. He describes most of his 'friends' as being phony and criticises everything from their behavior, to how they look. His Internal dialogue leaves less to be desired thus making him come across as sel-frighteous and hateful.(Note to authors: The best way to get a story across is creating a character that readers will empathize with). Holden is pathetic excuse of a hero. He's a coward, fake and self-absorbed. He basically hates everything and everybody which is understandable when you're depressed but him calling out the faults of society while being guilty of the same traits makes him a hypocrite. This is an obnoxiously long, depressing and pointless book. 200+ pages of listening to Holden whine about everything is an awful way to waste time. The scene that annoyed me the most was when Holden was crashing at his teacher's house and the little prick ends up accusing Mr.Antolini of making a pass at him. (read that part again, Mr.Antolini is not guilty!). He just had to go and tarnish the reputation of the only decent character in this whole book(Damn you Holden Caulfield!!!)I kept reading this piece of filth at the hopes that through his wanderings (which I later realise it spans for a period of 2 days but felt like 2 years when reading) he'll come through some breakthrough and realise that there is some good in this world but no. The book ends the same way it starts with Holden still unlikeable. This book killed me, seriously! sucked the life out of me and left me more depressed than I ever was. J.D. Salinger is just one big phony who got away with this atrocity merely because he was smart enough to realise how phony society really is and how not many people have enough individuality to call him out on a bad book. The same people who highly rated this crap are the same people he's making fun of in the book. The irony."
2122,Beth Drinkard,I did not like this book at all and I feel that I should have because it's obviously one of America classics but unfortunately it was just not for me. 
2123,Erika Fleming,"Being a teenager, I did not feel I really related with Holden; instead found him annoying most of the book. I could not stand all his hypocritical remarks and actions, nor the fact that everyone was a phony. This book was totally not what I was expecting. "
2124,Murry,"Holden Caulfield is an obnoxious main character with whom I could not sympathize. He curses too much and has too many issues that I simply did not care about. He's a lier and a hypocrite. I know he is supposed to be the ""cynical adolescent"" but he was more like a rude, whiny crybaby. His journey is incredibly boring. I understood the message the novel was trying to send, but that message could've been conveyed in about 50 pages. Instead I had to watch this annoying, bratty character hate on everything, get depressed for no reason, drink, curse, smoke, talk about girls like objects, delve into his angst, and make a slew of bad decisions. I wouldn't have even finished this novel if I hadn't chosen it for a school report. Horrible character! Horrible book!"
2125,Marcia,A teacher recommended this to me when I was in school and said she thought I would particularly like it. I pretty much hated it. I should probably give it another shot as an adult. 
2126,Hayden,"I have every intention of reading many books in my lifetime. Seeing as I have not yet lived even half of my life, my next comment could possibly be revised during the course of my years on this earth: The Catcher in the Rye is the worst book that I have ever had the misfortune of reading -- twice! That is correct. I have now read Salinger's award winning novel two times. I read it when I was seventeen because my english teacher told me I had to. I was disappointed in the book's content at the time, but I decided to give it another chance as an adult. My motivation for rereading this novel came from the desire to see what about the book would prompt a man to kill a celebrity. I was expecting to turn the last page feeling enlightened and empowered. In fact, many reviews on this site alone claim that the book ""changed my life"". I am sad to say that not only did my life not change as a result of rereading this novel, but my opinion has not changed after my second reading. This novel is nothing but an overrated attempt to capture the thought process of a spoiled rich kid with absolutely no personality. If I had to hear Holden think or say the phrase ""to tell you the truth"" one more time, I was going to need a straight jacket and a padded room. Now, I have read other reviews of people who have felt the same way I do. It seems that they are attacked by fans of the book who claim ""if you don't like the novel, it's because you don't get it"", yet, no one has explained what exactly we don't get. My theory is that someone of importance said the book was amazing and everyone jumped on board merely to please the individual. This book is a terrible representation of good writing and it is a travesty that Holden Caulfield is held in such high regard. "
2127,Artyom Korovin,"Forgive me saying that, but it's total BS, this book! Didn't like it at all, I'd even say I loathe it so much. I realize that it was groundbreaking and stuff but really - I wish I hadn't read that one at all!"
2128,Michelle Herrett,"JESUS WEPT.Now I know why a movie has never been made of The Catcher in the Rye - because even Zac Efron wouldn't want to be in it. The reason I've given this book one star is because Goodreads have yet to develop the Negative Ratings system, but I'm sure they'll catch up soon.This is a 'seminal classic', or so every hipster worth his bicycle basket would have you believe. So when I finally got around to reading it as a 36 year old mother of 4, I was thrilled to be finding out what all the fuss is about. All I can say is, thank God I've read it for the first time at an age where I can articulate my emotions, because if I had read it in high school, I'm pretty sure the entire world would have be reduced to pink mist at the frustrated and disgruntled hands of my AK-47.It slices me in half that this drivel is so lauded when there are kindergarten kids writing perfectly good sentences about whales and bananas which never make it out of the classroom, much less onto a 100-books-to-read-before-you-die list. There were a couple of astute observations, and there are several passages that are quite amusing, but the problem is that by the time you get to them, you are so atrophied with boredom that your body no longer remembers how to laugh and can only emit a slow, pained whine instead. Or maybe that was just Holden, moaning again?There is absolutely nothing this character does not complain about. I'm pretty sure that if a clown tried to give him a balloon filled with 40 million dollars, Holden would call him a phoney and tell him to fuck off. Are we supposed to be surprised that he's actually a virgin? Of course he is. Imagine him having sex with someone - ""My orgasm was pretty crummy. How was yours goddammit. Wait...you didn't have one? ARE YOU A PHONEY? Boy, that kills me, if you want to know the truth. I mean. Boy.""No wonder JD Salinger became a recluse after this became so successful. I'd be embarrassed too."
2129,linhtalinhtinh,"Warning: Not a review. Only a personal experience. Now, this is one of the first books I read in English. That was maybe 5, 6 years ago. One classmate had it in her hand, a rather dull self-printed-out version (original English version was too expensive for us students), but she devoured it happily and tugged it with herself a few days. I was impressed. So, I printed it out and imagined myself enjoying it too. Welcome to the literary world (I was kinda new then).Shit, that never came. I was lying on bed holding a hundred A4 pages, feeling mortified, when my older sister asked:- What do you have all evening? (She saw my torturous facial expression)- A book my friend and tons of people seem to enjoy. It seems famous too and many's favorites (sorry, this was already late high school but we did not have western education). - What is it about?- Well, there is this boy and this is one of his days. He talks and whines about it. (I grimaced)- So? (She laughed)- Er...- Is it... interesting? (still laughing)- Er... No. It does not even make sense to me why a book is written out of this.- So why are you reading it?- You're right.So I discarded it, regretting the money I paid for printing. The next few days, another classmate asked me about it. I told her, ""This book (I mumbled) The rye in the catcher... (the other classmate hissed Cather in the rye), I did not get it... It is supposed to be influential for teenagers. But I am famous for being childish, immature, slow growth, lazy thinking, shallow, whatever, right? So, I dropped it.""A few years later, when I went to college, I picked up the book once again. Come on, everyone read it. I was kinda embarrassed that I did not, so I tried one more time, testing whether I was a bit more grown up to ""feel"" it then.This time I did finish the book. But well, same thing happened (shrug). I did not get what was the point and did not even bother to read other reviews/critics to understand to find out the reasons for my indifference. That was the extent how much the book did not interest me. Because I think the blame was on me, I shyly rated it 3 stars.Now, that's funny. I never connected to this teenager. Why should I be afraid to show that I never got it? So, here it is. 1 star. "
2130,Robert Brown,This bitch needs grow some balls and stop wining like a little bitch about EVERYTHING! How can someone go through a midlife crisis in their teens?! Grow Up!
2131,Mel (Daily Prophecy),"What a horrible bullshit book. I would give it no stars if I could, but that's for DNF books and unfortunately I had to finish it. Thanks book club, haha. I seriously can't understand how this ever turned into a classic?? Nothing happens and the main character is so frustrating and boring.Some of the high ratings surprise me, because REALLY? REALLY? This is all I have to say about this."
2132,Debra Duffy,Absolutely painful to get through! Hated every minute of it! Just thankful I didn't read it as an adolescent-might have grown up thinking this was normal! Horrid! 
2133,Ginevra Dean,"American Lit. require reading.I honestly couldn't deal with the main characters personality. It drove me up the wall. J. D. Salinger is a good author, I just didn't like this plot or the characters in it."
2134,Nicole Rhaven,"I read this book for the first time last year...and I remember debating the rating. It went something like this:""Ugh, everyone loves this book but I hated it, what do I do? Do I single myself out or lie and rate it 4 or 5 stars even though I thought it was crap? Hahaha, yeah right, I don't think so. I don't lie and if people think I am crazy because of it, so be it. I rather live the truth than hide under a lie.""I just didn't like this book. It was just some 16 year old guy, Holden, rambling for 128 pages, about nothing. Seriously. He gets kicked out of school, then floats around worried about what his parents are going to think and then...nothing. We don't even get to find out what happens when he gets home! Usually, I am completely fine with that open endings, but I really didn't like Holden too much. Not that he was a bad guy or anything, but if I had to read ""and all"" one more time...I swear...I also heard that this was more of a ""guy"" book. So, whatever, maybe that's why I didn't like this book. I don't know. I found it to be rather dull and pointless. "
2135,Victoria,"I went through a time when I wanted to read classics, all the classics I had missed in school. As I started my list of ""to reads"", ""The Catcher in the Rye"" made the top of my list, partially because I wondered what was in it that made so many serial killers have it on their person when they committed their dirty deeds.After I read it, I totally understood. They killed people after they read this book because they were so frustrated at the realization that they would never be able to recover the two hours they spent reading this piece of garbage, they went berserk and began violently attacking people.When I put the book down, I had this feeling of, ""What the heck just happened? Nothing happened. I just read a book where absolutely nothing happened."" It's a coming of age story where nobody came of age. He goes to the train station and doesn't even call anyone, he doesn't meet up with ""Faith"", he won't sit with the ladies at the table, he won't sleep with the prostitute, he watches his sister ride a carousel... the end. What in the WORLD?! Perhaps there is much more going on here than I am intellectually able to realize, or maybe I just know a boring book when I read one. I was very let down by this book but promise I will not impart harm upon anyone!"
2136,Philip Martyn,"Frankly, this book is a waste of time. Holden's legitimate disillusionment with the authority figures in his life and miserable attempts to find himself may be an indictment of our society, but I don't think it paints the whole picture, and his resolve at the end of the book offers false hope.It was irritating and not in a way that helped me think critically about myself or my society. It said things that were obvious without any additional insights."
2137,Kandy,I really did not understand what was so wonderful about a youth that was so flagerently wasting his parents money by being such a bad student and getting kicked out of school after school. 
2138,Andrew Samano,The Catcher in the Rye is the worst book ever...dont read it unless you like reading about crazy people plus its boring as hell !!!!
2139,Ignat,"Very rarely one can read a book and truly pray for it to end sooner. Annoying narrative at best, with rather limited language - around 10 verbs, and 20 adjectives. Reading the same phrases from the first to the last page - ""all over the place"", ""...and all"", ""anyway"", ""i did too"", ""phony"". Just blah. It just reads slowly and annoying. Maybe it was a masterpiece in the 1950s, but now it's quite obsolete.Are we supposed to watch the fall of the main character in the course of 90% of the book and then his redemption in the last 20 pages? You never understand why he falls or what redeems himself. You just wait for his ""red hunting hat"" to be mentioned. Blah."
2140,Misty,"Понякога ми става много чудно, как някои книги стават ""класика"", световно извести и тям подобни, при положение,че са пълна простотия ! Не бих препоръчала тази книги и на най-лошия си враг! Загуба на време! "
2141,India Garms,"I really, genuinely disliked this book. Holden is absurdly judgmental, especially toward women, and hates nearly everything. His numerous catchphrases were annoying. Glad I read it, will not reread."
2142,sologdin,"prep school douche yearns for simple pastoral life, wherein he can herd childrens through fields of grains. in that regard, he is very similar to Shakespeare's Richard II, except that Richard II doesn't suck. anyway, am eagerly awaiting the inevitable mashup: Catcher in the R'lyeh Wgah'nagl Fhtagn, wherein dead cthulhu arises to kill off the prep school douches."
2143,Kristin Stone,"It's been a long while since I read this. I never understood it when someone ""loved"" his book. I didn't connect with it, and, quite frankly, I thought it was weird. Not like cool, science fiction weird, but rather ""what the heck is he talking about"" weird. I don't know if I will try to read it again because there are always so many other books I actually want to read."
2144,Justin Scharton,"I found this book terrible. Perhaps I just didn't get it, but by chapter 7 I was so bored of reading this whiny teenager's horrible grammar that I just couldn't continue. Maybe I'll try it again some day."
2145,Amanda Pedersen,"I tried. I really, really did. It's just not my thing. I get that it's a classic and that if I could get past the first few chapters of the book that it MIGHT be better, but i'm not going to put myself through torture to read a book. I wasn't a fan of the style of writing, which is probably the biggest turn off when reading. If I'm assigned this for a college class, i'll have not much choice but to read it, but I seriously doubt I'll ever be reading this on my own time for pleasure. "
2146,Carrie,There was nothing special about this story. I found Holden Caulfield to be an irritating character who had to have an opinion on absolutely everything.
2147,Jacklyn,"You either love it or you hate it. I hated it. i really dont know what else to say about it, it was just that bad."
2148,Fabrizio Valenza,Insopportabile. E via dicendo.
2149,Maddi,"Absolutely hate this book. The main character is so annoying and I can't focus on any other characters because they come and go so fast. Terrible, would not recommend it to anyone."
2150,Catherine Fox,"I was reccomened this book by so many people but I just found it so boring. It did a very very good job at sending my to sleep, and to be honest that was the only good and efficient thing about it. Took me ages to read it in comparison to its length, can you guess why? Because it was so boring to read I would procrastinate by reading something good instead. What can I say, I did finish it and as soon as I did I thanked the Lord and took it straight to a charity shop."
2151,Michelle Lilholm,"I had a really hard time getting through this book. I think the main reason is that I've never felt what Holden Caulfield, the narrator and main character, feels, so I had a really hard time relating to him.I read it because it was a classic, but hadn't it been a classic, I wouldn't have gotten through it.That's the first reason to why I only gave it one star. The other is that I really didn't like the way and style it was written in."
2152,Sue,Not my cup of tea....read this when Nick was reading it in 11th grade and I guess if you're a teenager you can relate to Holden??? I am too old to appreciate it. If I want to be depressed I can read Bukowski!
2153,Mandy,"I was bored the entire time. I didn't care about the characters, the situations, the outcomes or what the author was trying to say. Teenage angst and ramblings at its finest. "
2154,Marina D' Souza,"How do you review a book that has nothing to recommend it - except perhaps that it is featured on every must-read list? I suppose the author might have been trying to make a point about how immature, confused, judgmental and angry we all were as teenagers - and that point was made - but turning a - why-i-hate-my-life rant into a novel is unforgivable. "
2155,Mason,"I did not like this book. It was terrible. People say the writing style was how Holden talked, it's not. All of the people talk like that, so it's the author. The words Hey, Godamn, and Boy so many times, it's ridiculous. The story is not inspirational or anything like that, it's about a whiny kid who has nothing to complain about but complains about everyone and everything anyway. Then there was the whole John Lennon thing... so yeah... it sucks."
2156,Blskelly,Read it in high school. Pretty challenging read and I didn't really care for the story even though it's considered a classic.
2157,Shaun Joseph,"Is it just me or did anybody find Holden Caulfield such a horrendous and annoying person? I read this book with high expectations, yes because of it considered being a literary phenomenon and because of the controversy. But Holden just annoyed me. I found he just whinged and whined for the better part of the novel and found it concerning that he was considered the voice of his generation "
2158,Mike,Misery loves company....and this book. Read it twice and still couldn't see how life altering it is for some. Immaturity is not a virtue.
2159,buhfly,"I cannot express how much I hated this book. I shouldn't even give it one star. Holden is a whiny, annoying, self-obsessed brat. There was no one even remotely likable in the book, I couldn't care less what happened, and I honestly just did not see the point."
2160,Sue Shores,"I picked up this book remembering I had read it in my teens. reading it now in my forties I felt ""what an annoying, whinning teenager.Who needs more of that?"" I guess I'm just getting old. Would not recomend this book to anyone over the age of 17."
2161,Citymusings,"I actually didn't finish this book. Although the story seems like it has a lot of potential, God's name was used as a curse so many times. It just grieves my spirit. I couldn't take any more of it. "
2162,Kayla,I really couldnt wait for this book to be over. Another english class read. I thought it was never going to end honestly.
2163,AmateurPainter,"I think I liked this book when I first read it about fifty years ago but that was probably because I thought I was SUPPOSED to like it. After having just re-read it I see Holden as this whiney, snotnosed kid who is just as screwed up as all the people he hates. And I hated the book, too."
2164,Susan F,"I know this was a very popular book but I just did not like it. This was not an assignment, I read it on my own. "
2165,Sheri,"For all of the talk and controversy about this book, I expected it to be impossible to put down. Honestly, though, I found it seemed to drag on and on and I didn't enjoy it much. "
2166,Angela,I hate this book! I teach high school so I don't really need to hear any whiny boys who think they are entitled to everything.
2167,Carla D.,"1.5 starsOpinião do blog Pepita Mágica: http://pepitamagica.blogspot.pt/2015/...Desisti deste livro na página 134, o que já é mais de meio do livro. Estava a ser uma tortura. Eu raramente, ou mesmo nunca, deixo um livro por terminar. Maior parte das vezes quando um livro não está a funcionar para mim, deixo-o de lado e tento voltar a ele mais tarde. Às vezes não estamos no estado de espírito para determinado livro e isso influencia muito a forma como o recebemos interiormente. Mas definitivamente não vai acontecer com The Catcher in the Rye.Sinto que deveria gostar deste livro. A grande maioria das opiniões que li sobre ele falavam bem e glorificavam o livro no seu estatuto de clássico. Não entendo o porquê deste livro fazer parte das leituras obrigatórias do ensino americano, a menos que o propósito seja mesmo torturar os miúdos. Achei a história deste livro incrivelmente aborrecida. Não saía do mesmo: sempre Holden a queixar-se, a dizer que tudo o deprimia, e mais não sei quê. Não achei, de todo, que fosse uma personagem possível de se relacionar com. Quer dizer, até acredito que algumas pessoas consigam se identificar com Holden em determinados aspectos, mas não funciona. A escrita é um tanto ao quanto estranha, confesso, mas isso tem a ver com a altura em que foi escrito. É certo que tem pontos comuns com a actualidade, mas para mim não funciona. Acho que a escrita torna a história ainda mais aborrecida e atroz de continuar com a sua leitura. Para mim é um não definitivo e não entendo toda hype em torno deste livro. Juro que não. "
2168,Shawnda,"Not my kind of book. I have always wanted to read The Catcher in the Rye because it is supposed to be a classic. I find that word for this book debatable. It definatly is a different kind of book which made me interested in the first place, but the more I read the more I was praying for it to be over with. I cant read one more sentence of this whiney kid who hates everything. I know its supposed to be more deeper than that, but I just couldnt find it. Im glad I read it, but Im mostly glad to be done with it. "
2169,Leila,First time I read a book where I actively disliked the protagonist. The brass ring imagery is the only thing I took away from the book. 
2170,Nelly Rohleder,"Well, just the fact that the murderer of John Lennon read this book before he actually became a murderer, is a great misadvantage for that book. The content isn't any better. Sorry to all who actually like it."
2171,Kelly Driver,"I'm guessing the reason I didn't like this book is because I'm a 40-year-old woman. I never had to read it in High School so I figured I would tackle it as one of the ""classics"" I haven't read yet. I wish now that it would have stayed unread. When I finished it I felt like I do after a bad movie...I've lost time I'm never getting back. I have always found it interesting that a book where every fifth word is goddamn or bastard and that there are moments when the characters elude to death or sex and was controversial when it came out (the 50s) that it is somehow a classic. Of course it was controversial...it was the 50s, in America. That doesn't make it literature or a classic, it was barely good writing at all. I felt as if I were reading the diary of a sixteen year old boy in the 50s, so maybe it that respect it was brilliant. But, I seriously cannot understand how five pages about how someone else's cheap suitcase depresses them, is literature. Then again maybe I'm a 40-year-old woman who just doesn't get teenage male angst."
2172,Kierstin,"I technically didn't read this... so shame on me. Both my eighth and eleventh grade English classes have attempted getting me to read it, but I was able to get enough out of the book both times after merely glancing at a random page. The in-class discussions informed me enough about it to suit my interest (which was low).Despite his flaws and missteps and everything else, I guess you're supposed to catch on to Holden's character. (Wow, look at all the language this guy uses, he must be so great and misunderstood!...) I get that, but wait a minute -- where are the redeeming aspects to this guy? There aren't any? And where's the actual plot? Oh... well then count me out.I don't care how ""justified"" Holden was for saying and doing the things he did, I have read through many stories much more valiant than his. No note-worthy character arc = poor rating from Kierstin."
2173,Jillanov,I am one of the few people on earth who really disliked this story. I enjoyed the style of writing-- and admire Salinger's creativity in that regard-- but disliked the book itself.
2174,Johnny,THIS BOOK SUCKED. 
2175,Caleigh,I think I just don't like reading about normal people with everyday problems. Why should I have to suffer through some whiny adolescent boy's sulking for a hundred pages? I'm going to write the sequels:The Catcher in the Rye 2: Holden Realises He's Not a Special SnowflakeThe Catcher in the Rye 3: Something Actually Bad Happens to Holden The Catcher in the Rye 4: Holden Grows Up and Becomes Bearable
2176,Meagan,I don't understand why this book is such a big deal. 
2177,Gale,"A WHINY PREPPY'S PRIVATE BREAKDon't let the title fool you into thinking that this slim novel is about baseball or even agriculture. Set against the nostalgic backdrop of World War II as it was winding down CATCHER presents a series of flash backs from the 17-year-old protagonist, who is housed in a mental facility in California. Holden Caulfield at 16 is hardly a heroic type; rather he's a poor little rich kid who's just been expelled from his 4th boarding school. The entire 213 pages consist of Holden's non-stop personal revelations about himself, his family and his fellow students. Rarely requiring sleep or even nutritilnal sustenance, this whacked-out kid rambles during 100 agonziing pages to recount just one 24-hour period--leaving readers somewhat bewildered and breathless.For various reasons Holden decides to leave Pencey Prep several days before their official Christmas break starts--thanks to cash from a generous grandmother. Taking a train to NY City, where he was raised, poor kid-he tries to make it on his own for four days, before shamefully returning home to admit yet another academic debacle. During this time when he drops below the parental radar screen, he experiences a series of social and physical adventures-most of which prove unsatisfactory or unsavory. His fertile brain spews out unceasing commentary on Life, snipng those kids and adults who crossed his path; he dips ever deeper into grim reminiscences about his previous schools.Salinger's style of verbal gushing is easy to read-chatty and conversational, in fact--but the frantic pace can exhaust more mature readers. The way Holden abuses his body results in several bouts of illness for him, but his deepest wound may prove the death of his brother during the war. Were it not for the loyal devotion of his little sister, Phoebe, Holden might not be able to hang on to his sanity as questionably ""well"" as he thinks he has. He wonders if he needs faddish Psychoanalysis; shrinkage is what he eventually gets, but is that the only path to the full recovery of his delicate psyche?In the mid 80's one Ferris Bueller took a Day Off--perhaps inspired by Holden's mid-Forties private break with reality. Contemporary teenagers may even sympathize with his anguished pilgrimage to escape the phonies of this world. Liberaly laced with grammatical vulgarity CATCHER proves a grim roller coaster ride through the egotistical thought processes of a disturbed youth, who makes it a point of honor to be NOT HOME--alone. Enjoy it if you can!  (January 25, 2013)"
2178,Bradley Kitada,"One of my least favorite books of all time. I get that it's supposed to speak teen anxiety and the spirit of rebellion and the cynical view of the world but, the thing is, it doesn`t. At least it didn't to me. I read it when I was around sixteen and all I could get out of it was some whiny kid, who would nowadays probably be diagnosed with autism or something, complain about how much the world sucked. There was no discernable plot or lesson anywhere that I could find. The only consolation that I have is figuring that my childhood and life weren't shitty enough for me to be affected. RIP John Lennon"
2179,Bayley Mitchell,"Sorry, not sorry. I did not like this book, at all. There was a complete lack of plot-line which made the book tedious and pointless. The story contained to content and no proper meaning or message. I also found myself disliking the main character, Holden as he was just so repetitive and lacked any strong personality traits. I just had so many high expectations for this book after seeing rave reviews but now I feel extremely disappointed. "
2180,Shelley,"I only read for a half hour or two, but the underlying feel and cussing language was horrendous. Not worth it!"
2181,Kelcie,"I hated this book. It was very monotonous and depressing, but I think I felt that way because I read it when I was very young and not nearly as cynical as I am now. I am going to try and read it again to see if things go better the second time around. "
2182,Chelz,"I read this book over 10 years ago as it was required reading in High School. I know many find this book great and inspiring, while I found it the exact opposite. I found it extremely lacking and dull. I never felt anything for Holden and in fact found him as a character annoying.If you are looking for angst y teen rebel type of book I would suggest Clockwork Orange. A similar story with much more interesting characters and plot. "
2183,Twm,"The writing is great, it really makes me hate everything about Holden and seems to epitomize teenage angst.Chapter by chapter I am increasingly frustrated with Holden Caulfield, because he keeps doing stupid stuff. He hates movies, but goes to see them anyway. He hates people, but hangs out with them anyway. He doesn't understand his emotions and acts out. He hates everything there is in the world and couldn't name one specific thing he liked to his little sister. And his dream for the future would be to ignore everyone, not talk to anyone, and live out near the woods, and that'd be his peace. Like fun he'd actually accomplish even that. He continually puts himself in situations that he knows he isn't going to like, because he's depressed and lonely, and all of these situations he hates are just barely better than being alone. I think if you can relate to Holden on many levels, you should schedule for counseling, because he has deep seated issues and you probably do too. I'd definitely recommend the book. Everyone should at least get a chance to read the book, maybe even twice in their lifetimes. Once as a teenager, and once a few decades later as an adult. I just happened to not enjoy reading the book because of Holden's character. Although when I was 16 or so, I probably would have loved everything about this."
2184,Yasir Saeed,"I personally think that this is one of the worst books I've ever read or probably read in my life. It was physically, mentally and emotionally painful to read a book like that. I fail to understand why this book is one of the best 100 books of all times. It was an utter torture but then i had to finish it. "
2185,Mudit Sood,Dreadful book! Absolutely pathetic story. What was the age of the character? 16? As if life ends at 20! And this book happens to be one of the classics of all time with widespread readership amongst the young? This fact kills me every time I stumble on it on the internet!Oh shit! I have started sounding like Holden! I better end this here.The worst read ever.
2186,Kate Kurgan,"The Catcher in The Rye is the worst book I have ever read. The main character is annoying, all he ever did was complain about how crappyeverything was. I think the book was really unrealistic. Holden has all of this money that he keeps spending generously in NY but it never explains how he got all of this money. I personally didn't like the book but I there are still a few good things. Like how he is very social. He only complains but at least he still goes out. I believe he has depression however he is not the typical depressed teenager. he doesn't sit around by himself he goes out and does stuff, he just complains about them after. I thought that this was kind of refreshing in a way. This book reminds me of perks of being a wallflower. charlie and Holden are very similar, they are both awkward teenage boys just trying to figure out who they are. I would recommend this book to teachers, because they somehow find meaning in it. "
2187,Jessalyn,"I'm sorry, but I hated this book. The kid is crazy. And seeing as this was one of my sister's favorites...yeah we are opposites lol"
2188,Preetm,"didnt like the book... read it long time back... the writing style ( may be as the story is from the perspective of a kid, deserved such a treatment) was very casual... but the good thing is that its a quick read...the sooner you complete the sooner you'd be depressed ;-) ( havent understood why this book is adored all over)"
2189,Mega Awesome,Um.....
2190,Gina,"One of the most overrated books ever. I really couldn't stand it. The main character was so unsympathetic, and to me it was just boring."
2191,Lawrence,"I bought this book about a year ago, due to all the hype about it and 2002 Space Odyssey film. I had heard so much about it, and I suppose at the time of it's release it was very avant garde, but it doesn't translate into today's language as anything special. I finished it and thought 'I must have missed something, I'll read it again', but decided that life's too short.Complete waste of time in my opinion."
2192,Menna,"Awful. Completely don't understand the hype. To say that reading this book was a waste of my time would make me feel awful so I'll just say that I'm thankful that I never have to read it again. I know this book is like, a big deal, but it felt like wading through treacle. And nothing happened. Run, don't walk from this book."
2193,Andreaks,"This story has no highlights, it´s just a long rant. You´re lead to believe that Holden Caulfield is going to experience something, do something or feel something of importance, but every time I started holding my breath I was disappointed. Besides the fact that nothing ever truly happens, you never really get to the bottom of Holden´s feelings either. Is there anxiety, depression, mental problems, loss over his brother, have there been sexual abuse in his past or WHAT? This book answers no questions, and only hints at interesting themes. I´m really disappointed, especially since this is supposed to be a classic."
2194,Amy,"I'm not sure why this book is considered a ""classic"". Is there a morale/plot/lesson that I missed? Could anyone explain it to me?"
2195,Jen Decker,"I don't get it? Why is this a classic, it is like living in a teen boys head"
2196,Kristin ,"I read this book my freshman year of high school. At that point in time, I just thought that Holden Caulfield was such a jerk. If he had been a student at my high school, I probably would have had nothing to do with him."
2197,Collin Holder,"“The Cather in the Rye” by J. D. Salinger is not a book I would recommend for the normal, level headed individual. The main character, Holden Caulfield is a troubled teen, trying to find his way through life. He is lives in a pessimistic world, full of optimistic people. Personally, the novel is not something I enjoy; being that Holden seems to be more of a typical annoying teenager who always looks on the negative. From chapter one of the novel we learn that he has serious problems with connecting with people even more seriously having a normal relationship. When reading the novel the voice you hear telling the story is Holden’s. Unfortunately, since he is so depressed the majority of the novel, it could easily get you depressed as well. ?IF YOU REALLY want to hear about it, the first thing you will probably want to know is where I was born, and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I do not feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth.? This is the first paragraph of the novel, and you hear immediately the negative in his voice. Because of Holden’s negativity the image you get of Holden is the shy, freckle covered boy, with long hair, wears clothes that are too big, and always wears a hat so no one can see his eyes. One of the most disturbing things, for me, in the novel is how Holden is always using the word goddam. Salinger uses it so frequently you become almost “immune” to hearing it. Going through changes is hard for teenagers, and we learn this when Holden began to talk on his sex life. “In my mind I am probably the biggest sex maniac you ever saw. Sometimes I can think of very crumby stuff, and I wouldn’t mind doing it if the opportunity came up.” Unfortunately, for Holden, he has no steady girlfriend so his sex life sucks. Through the novel you hear him always talk about sex, and is always around sex, for instance you get too see Holden in a very sleazy hotel surrounded by stage sex! But the truth his sex life sucks. His life is so good, but the end of the novel you feel so sorry for this guy it is not even funny. He complains about everything, and it drives me crazy! He complains about Pencey, which the narrator explains to us that it is one of the best schools in the country. Of course, every prep school he gets in to, he fails out of. He constantly lies and makes up fake names to introduce him self to people. “Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Jim Steele” I said. His sister Phoebe is the only relationship he actually trust in the novel, which is one of the only normal thing in the book, but Salinger makes it weird! He turns their relationship into something that Holden feels like he has to have.	The cussing, his sexual attitude, his underage drinking, what all he has witnessed through school, and not to mention there is even a suicide in the story! These all had an effect on me, and turned me against any sixteen year old boy trying to tell the story of his life where all of these facts are included. Holden admits to being an atheist, which helps me as a catholic understand why he thinks the way he does about some things. Again, he is just a very lost boy trying to make it through the world, but tends to struggle all of the way through. "
2198,Muhammad Aprianto Ramadhan,"Cukup. Saya rasa membaca buku ini tidak memberikan nilai tambah apa-apa, malahan membuat kesal. Holden Caufield terlalu kekanak-kanakan dan sulit untuk disukai, bahkan sebagai seorang remaja."
2199,Daphne,"I read this when everyone else did, young. It must be a guy thing. It left a bad taste in my mouth back then that remains to this day. The reputation Salinger has surprises me. Was it because he wrote it so long ago when teenagers where just being created by the media, and therefore a tale of a young man's angst/growing up/whatever was a novelty? I don't know. All I know is it's one of my least favorite books of all time. By now, I imagine you're required to love it, or stand before your peers as an idiot. Fah. "
2200,Irene Reid,"This is one of those books that you are expected to read and to love. I managed to avoid reading it until about a year ago when I finally picked it up to see what all the fuss was about. I found it really tedious, I really didnt care about the moody teenager or his opinions, and only battled through it to at least be able to say I'd read it. I doubt very much that my opinion would have been any different if I had read it as a teenager - I would still have found him achingly boring."
2201,Paulien,"Have to admit... Is not my kind of book, so I will not continue to read. I've to force myself to read and that makes reading no fun. Do have to admit, the author have written in an unique way but it never caught me from the start. Somehow I can't connect with the character. Maybe because the way he thinks, act. I don't know why, it just don't get me.I give one star just for the unique way of writing but that is it."
2202,Bobbi Joles,"I have very little to say about this book, so this won't take very long. Poorly written. Incredibly boring. Don't bother. The End "
2203,Klaudia,"Never understood how other people raved at this book. Simply put, Holden Caulfield is an AH. Why would anyone want to spend their time (even reading) in the presence of such a person? "
2204,Saralyn,"I'll repeat what others have said: you totally relate to Holden and love the book or you don't get him at all and really don't like it.I'm in the latter category. Holden was whiny, obnoxious, bored with everything, etc. He had no redeeming qualities. He was the type of kid I made fun of in High School.Honestly, it makes me a little annoyed that this book is given to High School students to read. Not because it's ""offensive"", but because it's such a stupid classic. Most classics are beyond amazing, but this and The Great Gatsby seem to always be given to High Schooler's instead.. something is wrong here.Granted, I'm the type of person that relates to Frankenstein's monster, Dorian Gray, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, etc. so what do I really have to say?"
2205,Cheri Hoffman,I know everyone raves about this book...but I couldn't stand Holden Caulfield and therefore hated reading from his perspective. It didn't help that this was assigned to me by one of my least favorite high school teachers ever.
2206,John Preston,"I rated the book 1-star (did not like it). I'm not sure I even have that strong of emotions about the book. It was like reading the ingredients on a box of cereal. The writing was ""ok."" The style was that of a diary entry ""I did this thing, then I did that thing..."" I'm not sure if Salinger was going for this but it was written as a teenager would write (a bad teenage writer), which didn't capture the readers attention. I found myself just trying to get to the next event. I was reading other reviews and many people expressed how they related to Holden and many other how they didn't relate. It's not that I did or didn't relate Holden; I didn't think he was real. The only time I felt he was real was when he was in the room with his sister. I don't think I've read a book where I thought more about the author's motivation for writing it then the actual characters in the book. "
2207,Nancy Monson,Twaddle. Can we stop force-feeding this to every pubescent who passes through the public education system already?
2208,Parinaz,"Argh this book. I'd heard so many good things about it. That it's so revolutionary and like nothing you've ever read before. Well, the latter was correct actually, it really was like nothing I'd read before. I hated the juvenile style of writing. And I know it's supposed to be one of the charms of the book. But it just didn't click with me. I was bored everytime I tried to read it. And throughout I kept thinking what's wrong with me? Why am I not enjoying this? Why can't I think that it's amazing, like everybody else does? The more I read the more I felt like there was something wrong with me. I was so thrilled when I had finally finished it. The only thing I liked about it, which gets 1 star, was the representation of the emotional turmoil and mental health of a teenager. That's the only positive thing I can say about it. Now I'm off to read something much more interesting and readable, like Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy. "
2209,Michael Whitt,This book was very boring and not interesting. He was a bad kid with rich parents. The only reason I would like this book is because he does not care what other people think about him. He was a boy always getting introuble and always fighting. I will never read this book agian. It was terriable!
2210,Shane Hyham,This is in my top 3 worst books of all time. It's on my list of books that change your life but not for the better how they could have teenagers reading this mind numbing rubbish in schools is beyond me I'm not sure what theyre ment to get out of it. We should be trying to encourage teenagers to read not put them off by subjecting them to this book. 
2211,Silly, It everyone fault but mine. Their all phonies. Horrible book. The end is good but not worth all the unjustified blame given off by Holden. 
2212,Dem,"The Catcher in the Rye by J.D Salinger is one of those classics that everybody says you have to read, Well I have read it and it just didn’t have any impact on me at all.Three things about this Novel annoyed me, Firstly the repetitive use of words like phoney, goddam, madman, crazy and sore, I know that these words accurately reflected the teenage colloquial speech of the time however the over use of this vocabulary really got on my nerves.Secondly, Salinger presents The Catcher in the Rye through a first person point of view. I found this really interesting to begin with however I found myself getting tired of the narrator Holden Caulfield as he is not really a reliable character in his understanding and reporting of events. Thirdly and most importantly Catcher in the Rye lacked a proper plot. I felt you have to dissect this book to really get the true meaning of what J.D Salinger wanted to get across with this story, and for me the book really is not worth the effort for that.For me a 5 star read and a classic worth reading is To Kill a Mockingbird"
2213,Chelsea,"And the award for most-overrated ""classic"" goes to... yeah, probably this book. The perspective of a whiny, emo, I-hate-the-world-and-it-hates-me kid does absolutely nothing but get under my skin."
2214,Saoirse T. E. Sterling,"Read as part of the #InfiniteVariety2016 Reading Challenge based on the BBC's Big Read poll.If I hadn't been reading this as part of the challenge, I would have given up after the first page. Even the first sentence. I have tried since I finished it to find any kind of positive thing to say, and all I can conclude is that it was relatively written well, in that the grammar was fine and the punctuation was in the correct places.People have said you have to identify with Holden in order to understand the book, but I don't think identifying with him is a good thing at all. He's lazy, he's sexist, he's homophobic and he's very mentally disturbed. Whilst I can almost put some of this in to context because of the time it was written (when it was ""okay"" to be homophobic and sexist), I can't understand how in this day and age you can sit there and go ""man, I get this character"".There was absolutely no plot, except a vague reference to how he has been on a downward spiral since his brother died, which is the whole basis of the book but isn't really explored in a way I think a modern book would be, which is fine. Again, of the time, but still plotless and unnecessary. It was slow despite it taking place over a very short space of time and I took absolutely nothing from it."
2215,Jenny,I think this is the worst book I have ever read.Childish and immature.I do not understand the hype behind this awful story.
2216,May Bravo,"What an entitled boy. I get that it was a big thig back then, but for anyone who reads it today, the story is just about a boy that cannot appreciate what he has. "
2217,Leonela,Did not finish it. I hate Holden Caulfield
2218,Diana,"I hated Holden Caulfield, even as a teenager, when I read this book. I found him to be self-involved, spoiled, hypocritical, and utterly loathsome. It didn't speak to me then, and I highly doubt it would speak to me now. The fact that he is one of the most highly regarded protagonists in literature really upsets me; so many people influenced by him.... why?"
2219,Diane,"I hate this book when it was assigned to us in high school & I hated when I reread it at 30. I could not relate whatsoever to Holden and found him even whinier this time around, probably because I'm twice as old as I was the first time I read it."
2220,Kristine,"This is a bit harsh, but truly what I thought. I was astounded that when I read the last page, it was the end of the book. The character never changed and nothing happened. I obviously don't have an appreciation for this type of writing. Each page was littered with profanity. The ""growing up"" theme could have been demonstrated a hundred different ways besides this. I only continued reading because I thought, or rather hoped, it would suddenly get better. I like books that inspire and cause me to think. This one left me in a stupor. "
2221,Lamazone,Een ongelooflijk overschat boek.
2222,Erika,"I hated this book with a fiery passion. I lump books like this in with artists like Jackson Pollack. I won't say I don't get it. I DO get it, and that's where my disgust comes from. Holden is awful and I'm happy to say that at no point in my life have I identified with him."
2223,Vief,"I couldn't finish this book, I hate it so much, I keep telling myself I need to finish it before I can pass a judgment on it, because so many people seem to love it and maybe I just don't understand it?But seriously. I really do not like anything about it and I rather start doing the dishes than keep reading this book."
2224,Achyut Shukla,"""If you really want to know about it"" any work has a distinct style and this is what endears it or not. The style of the book is too direct, but the author is cautious enough to not to overdo the directness. Apart from the prose, the directness is implict in the chapters of the book which are just numbers, placed such that your most likely to miss. The author doesn't confuse the readers by using too many words about anything, a fact corroborated by the size of the book. "
2225,Jenna,I had been looking for a really good book to read and I came across a lot of people saying how much they loved this book. So I decided to read it. I honestly did not this book. I can't believe I read the whole thing. The reason I did I think is because I wanted to find out what people loved so much about this book. I never found it though. The book was not terrible but it was not at all as good as I thought it would be. The book was filled with swear words in ever paragraph and the story to me did not have a really good message. Maybe I didn't like it because I'm only in 14. I think i have to read it again in high school so maybe I'll like it better then.
2226,Melissa Mitchell,"UGH!!! I hated this book!!! It was completely stream of consciousness, nothing made sense. It was so completely random. UGH!!"
2227,Jesse,"Maybe because so many people told me this book was amazing I had expectations that weren't possible to meet. I guess it doesn't really matter, the entire book was a let down."
2228,Delicious Strawberry,"Yes, I am not ashamed to admit it - I hated this book. Why? It certainly is not because I was forced to read this for school - I actually read this book of my own volition because I'd been hearing about what a classic it was, and I am an avid reader. So I pick it up and started reading it.I freaking hated Holden Caulfield. Now, I have read the other reviews on here (five-star) and dissertations on the deep meanings within the book and etc etc, so I listened with an open ear and mind on why people liked this book, and I respect that. I am not trashing anyone who liked this book, everyone has different tastes. But that doesn't cause me to hate Holden any less. I found his character utterly shallow and his adventures pointless especially since he got himself booted out of a private school, and this book a waste of paper, and that's how I feel about it.If you found this book to be awesome and learned something from it, then I'm happy for you, and I'm also glad that others could at least get something out of this book even if I didn't."
2229,erin,"I am sorry, but I could absolutely not stand Holden Caulfield. I kept wanting to shake him and tell him to grow up. And I was even supposed to identify with him, being all confused and adolescent. Also, the word ""crumby"" drove me up the f-ing wall."
2230,Janice Hsu,Honestly don't know why so many people like this book. Holden is just immature.
2231,Georgia,"I read this in high school and while I know it was supposed to express the feelings of youth, I didn't relate to it or felt it tied to my experiences. "
2232,Rashaad Smith,Well I think this book is really garbage. Holden was an imature self centerd arogant drunk that needs to get a life. He calls people phony's but really inside he know's he's a big phony. If he died at the end of the book I really would make it way better. If u like this I dont know how this book needs to ban again. 
2233,Ally,Wish I could have given the book a 0! It sucked and I couldn't have been more disappointed. With the narrator cursing on every page and never voicing a positive opinion made the book intolerable. I do not and never will refer to this as a classic or recommend it to others. 
2234,Melissa Hurwitz,"Ok, I'm totally lying with the one star. It's like saying I give great sex one star! No more cheese or napping."
2235,Kim Garrett,"This has been on my ""have to read"" list for many years-- many people I know love this book. From page one, I found the book annoying and only finished it because with every turn of the page, I kept thinking ""this book has GOT to get better."" But it never did. There was no story-- literally no plot and I refuse to believe that this is a realistic portrayal of how a 16 year old boy thinks.I don't know what this says about me-- the fact that I hate a book that is considered classic literature, but whatever it means, the fact remains that I wish I had the hours spent reading this book back!"
2236,Robb Fleming,"Well, if you want to know the truth, I think that Holden Caulfield is one of the most annoying, pathetic, and frustrating characters that I have ever been forced to put up with. I really don't think that this should be assigned to students anywhere."
2237,Marco,Classico sopravvalutato?
2238,Maddyr,I was so disappointed when I read this. I had heard it was a great American classic and I had never read it in High School so I was excited to pick it up as an adult. I never connected with the main character and really just didn't enjoy it.
2239,Conrad Keely,Was this not the most overrated book of the 20th century? Shame John Lennon had to die for it.
2240,Wayne Landry,"THEE worst book I've EVER read. How this book has become a ""classic"" or ""must read"" is beyond me. I understand it is supposed to be written from a teenager's point of view...but it still stinks. ""Miss Peregrine's..."" is from same perspective and is a terrific book. I wish I have the two hours it took me to read this back!"
2241,Desa,"i read this when i was going through my "" i should read that classic"" stage of my life. well....i shouldn't have bothered! i so completly disliked this book. i have NO idea why its a classic or why they make you read this one. bleck!"
2242,blushenka,"My brand of dislike for this book is so particular, I'm not even gonna bother explaining *shrug*^ Before y'all start bitchin' about it, may I point out this is something the main character might say. "
2243,Maria,"I think this is one of those books that you have to read at the PERFECT time in your life. Sadly, I had passed that point by the time I read it and all it did was annoy the crap out of me. "
2244,Spazz,"This book is a God awful waste of time. No wonder people who read it are murderers. It made me want to kill somebody, too, after suffering through that bullsh*t."
2245,Ace,HOLDEN CAULFIELD IS A WHINY BITCH.The plot was nothing but him being an indecisive little prick for three days as he went around New York city.
2246,Hanna,"I wanted to like this book. I'd heard a great deal of ""good things"" about it. Unfortunately I didn't care much for it. I felt almost as though I was being yelled at.... and when I wasn't being yelled at, it was like being trapped inside someone elses internal thoughts and they just WOULD.NOT.SHUT.UP. EVER."
2247,Damien,What on earth was all the fuss about? This came to me super highly rated as an all time classic and a must read. What a joke I found it boring and the main character was a pain. Even though it was short it was still a struggle to finish
2248,Amy J.,"I couldn't quite get into this book, I think I need to do some research on what the author is trying to tell his readers, maybe try harder to interpret the book. I picked it up because I read that t was a favorite book of one of my favorite childhood tv stars so I figured it must be good, but like I said I was having a hard time trying to figure out where the author was going with all his jibber-jabber. I'll try finishing it again later but I'm not too excited about it. "
2249,April,My problem with this book is that Holden is a whiny little punk. There is nothing redeeming about him until the very end and by that time I just wanted it to be over with.
2250,Morgan,"Couldn't get into this book at all. Sorry to all those who love it, but I finally stopped trying. Too many good books in the world to waste my time on those I dislike."
2251,Talha Saleem Qureshi,"This book was seriously weird. Halfway through it, I began to seriously question its status as a classic. I mean, it isn't worth it at all. At various points in the book, I couldn't help but skip entire paragraphs as I grew bored and frustrated. Holden is a seriously strange character, and I just don't get how people identify with him. I'm about the same age as Holden is, in the novel, but reading all of it was seriously a drag. Thankfully, it wasn't very long.I'm just stating my opinion. I didn't like it at all. Maybe someone else does; people like strange stuff these days.I almost forgot to mention that the frequent use of the words ""Goddamn""and ""Lousy"" really got on my nerves. "
2252,Sandra Sandle,"I found this book incredibly difficult to read and didn't make it past the first few pages. I guess I don't really like stream of consiousness style writing and as an English person, the American language was really hard for me to get into."
2253,Page,I hated this book! I think mainly b/c it seems like it was stream of consciousness writing and I just couldn't take it. 
2254,Arimas Jones,"I absolutely hated this book with every fiber of my being. It was boring and stupid and pointless. It doesn't seem like a classic peace of material and does not need to be studied every year. It is a waste of time. And it was not special. It seemed pretentious to me and over hyped. It is similar to modern day novels I read all the time just with no plot, not decent ending or beginning and of course a different era. Point being. This book was awful and I hate it."
2255,Mariana Schneider,"Now I know why this book is famous as ""the book that was being read by Lincoln's and Kennedy's killers."" It also made me want to murder someone. I hated it.I love reading, I love books, and I'm a pretty fast reader... but it took me two weeks to read this book, like it takes you a while to chew a mouthful of bad food that you don't really wanna swallow but you can't spit out.The main character is a whiny kid who hates everything and can't do anything right. It makes me want to punch him in the face until he has something to whine about."
2256,Alba,"És un libro horrible. En todo momento parece que lo haya escrito un chico de 16 años inmaduro, y sé que esta es la ""grácia"" del libro, pero en realidad no tiene ninguna. Aún así, el final esta bastante bien. Bastante bien teniendo en cuenta el nivel del libro y el odio que se le termina cogiendo al protagonista. Aunque al final todo mejora un poco."
2257,Bettina,"i wanted to re-read books from my younger years, unfortunately i started with this one.....it was awful....i couldnt get past it in high school and i still cant get past the first 4 pages of it now.....i dont feel so bad reading everyone elses reviews....im not sure why its on the top 100 books to read before you die list.....maybe someone can tell me someday"
2258,Rebecca Calhoun,"One of the most inane wastes of time of my life. I absolutely hate this book. Holden was one of those people who is annoyed by everything, which is ironic since he is one o the most annoying characters EVER, and he thinks everyone is phoney, when in truth, he is the biggest phony in the book. The story was pointless, the constant barrage of using the Lord's name in vain was not only offensive, but was downright annoying in it's constancy. I wanted to stop reading it, but I labored through just so I could say that I finally read the darn thing. This book reminded me just how much teenagers can get on my nerves, heck, if I could go back in time, I's smack my teenage self right across the face for being such a whiny brat. ugh... This book, which had no real plot stole many hours of my life that I will never get back, and if I could rate it lower than 1 star, I would. "
2259,Xan Holbrook,The single most overrated book in the English language. 
2260,Sobroderick,"This is the book my english teacher tortured me with and made me want to never pick up a written page again.Unfortunately, after years of therapy and bio-feedback training, I picked it up to read again.I hated Holden C. then, and I hate him more now.As a mom, he's the boy I'd forbid my daughter ever to see and call the police if he showed up on my door step.Someone smack him (and his little sibling), tell him to stop whining, slap a hold on his trust fund and make him get a job washing dishes at the local eatery for a while. And, force him to pay rent for once. Maybe he'll snap out of the ""fugue"" and listlessness he's been feeling and actually grow up and become a human adult.I have to say, though, that my English teacher was correct. A reaction, ANY reaction, to a book is always a good thing. Too bad that my reaction was one of complete and utter distaste and bile. This has to be the worst book I have ever read, and I have read some pretty bad ones in my years of devouring books."
2261,Garry Mccall,"Well what i thought about this book was that it was ok but really if i had to choose a book to read i wouldnt read this one because a charecter named Holden he always would complain about random things.He always call people phony and likes to skip school, he drinks at bars and smokes .This book was funny but annoying at the same time because of holden always complaining .We read this book during the first few weeks of school we read itr as a class and some times read for homework , we also took quizzes on it so that maid people have to read the book but the book was good."
2262,Sumin,"I feel like with this book, you either hate or or love it. I am one of those people who hated this book. I mean I just felt like it was really boring and there was an awful lot of cursing. And I found Holden Caufield just annoying. He just hated everything and everyone. "
2263,Nasha,Could not read it again now in 33 (first reading in 18 bewitching). Maybe now too old to identify myself with it. Sigh!
2264,Donna,"I read this in high school and I remember thinking ""Why does everyone think book is so wonderful?"" I disliked the Holden character and thought he was a whiner. Which ruined the whole book for me."
