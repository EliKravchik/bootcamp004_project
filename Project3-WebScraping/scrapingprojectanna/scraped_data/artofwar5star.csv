"29",28,"Ansar","The Art of War is a book worth reading simply because how you feel about it will determine what you actually know about literature and what makes a good book good.In the day and age of Twilight we often neglect books that are more than fluff. We often refuse to see the nuances or the allegory employed by authors of old. We don't like absorbing the content of a book and trying to understand it as much we like being given everything in black and white.The brilliance of authors of old was employing simplicity and leaving enough to the imagination. Growth from reading isn't about reading a bunch of words, anybody can read a bunch of words. Growth from books is simply about taking something that is as simple as sin in concept and growing from it.Shakespeare didn't want you to read the words on paper or watch actors badly portray the characters he drew. He played with the simplest of concepts like anger, love and lust. He wasn't trying to make you aware of the existence of such concepts since you no doubt already knew of their existence. What Shakespeare was trying to do was to get you to think and explore what seems like the obvious but what is often neglected.In the 21st century I suspect a lot of people would like to see The Art of War remade into a movie by Michael Bay with plenty of explosions. Unfortunately if you are looking for that in The Art of War or any great book then you are not going to get it.The sheer genius of this book is the inherent simplicity. There are no battles or wars, certainly no explosions. In fact perhaps this book isn't even suited to being called the Art of War. For a book about war it certainly seems to advocate winning without a single battle if possible.The Art of War engenders the warlike aspect of humanity and like any good book it doesn't teach you anything you wouldn't have known it just teaches you how to open your mind to things you are not thinking about. It's a book that will never get old."

Essential reading for life."
"39",38,"Leo Boulton","a new permanent read in my bookshelf"
"41",40,"Georgene","I have wanted to read this book for years. I finally found a copy at Barnes & Noble that was inexpensive and fairly well translated.The book is in two parts. The first part is the translation of Sun Tzu's ""The Art of War"". It is difficult to describe this as a book. It is more of a ""laundry list"" of ideas of what generals and leaders should and should not do during the course of fighting a war. That part runs about 51 pages. The second part is again the translation of ""The Art of War"" accompanied by several commentaries on the original book. Many sources are used. It seems to be fairly well researched. What I found astonishing is the stretch of time that this book encompasses! ""The Art of War"" was written down sometime around 600 BCE. However, within the book itself are references as far back as 1700 BCE and some of the commentaries were written as recently as the 18th century CA.Despite the incredible span of time this book covers, it is still relevant today. There has, of course, been much more added in terms of military tactics since 600 BCE, but what was relevant then, is still applicable now. "

If they had, we wouldn't currently be a war in Iraq or Afghanistan. Sample this book, you'll be surprised how smart they were in the 1500's."

"75",74,"Rahul Dhanik","The book is composed of 13 chapters, each of which focuses on a different aspect of war and one can use these 13 aspects in many areas of life like business management, office politics, sports, personal life etc. It's a smart and poetic book. Initially I was thinking what does an age old book about warfare and combat have to do with business or personal interactions? But later I found out that “The Art of War” is not about war so much as it is about the art of winning. Much of the text is about how to fight wars without actually having to do battle. It teaches us all the knowhow of facing life and its wars. This book is a gem in terms of knowledge and in terms of applicability to modern times.Anyone can apply its concepts to many areas of life. Moreover one do not have to be in the military, or politics or business to benefit from the direction in this text. Its insights can be applied in any situation that needs resolution and works even in interpersonal quests.As Sun Tzu quoted“One who knows the enemy and knows himself will not be in danger in a hundred battles.” it can be implemented as, business intelligence is crucial to learning the competitor's strengths and weaknesses and understanding one's own capabilities. It’s the same what we calls nowadays SWOT analysis.“Never fight a battle that you haven't already won”.Definitely a key insight here is Plan before you execute, and be ready for all situations.Every mantra of life i.e. from keeping your cool, to being patient, to finding your opening always represent a tactic that when wisely applied can dictate a winning strategy. The lessons learned in this book can be allied to relationship, friendship, career and make you a more complete person in general. I recommend every person to read Art of War, it’s a must read."
"76",75,"Justin Allen","Awesome book, a great read which took no time at all. loved it think every one should atleast check it out!

"81",80,"Ray Chahal","This great book of war edifies the ambitious souls about the taoist way of living, while enriching the mind with the various methods to abide in order to win any war and destroy even an enemy, much more powerful than us, even before the battle takes place; it teaches to succeed a battle even by staying a million miles away from the actual arena. Thus, this book detest the bloodshed by weapons and direct confrontation with an enemy, but emphasis on the practical benefits of winning the war by deceiving the enemy through intelligent strategies and unshakable principles.

"91",90,"Christopherseelie","This book is like a collection of Sudoku puzzles with all the values made relative. A mind-expanding presentation of ancient wisdom applicable to any possible conflict. Conquest is not victory. Deception can be genuine. The absolute goal of ""taking whole"" invites the possibility of a world where egos needn't clash and victory needn't be costly. The translators provide cogent commentary and helpful notes for approaching a text usually hindered by its removal from our everyday understanding. All in all, a provoking exercise that can enhance the reader's view and relation to conflict."

It is easy to see how 'the art of war' could be applied to many different situations and aspects of life -- sport, business, etc. etc. I never paid attention to how psychological war is -- of course it is!

"126",125,"Chris Reel","Not many books written for war time strategy can so easily be translated into a guide book for how to overcome struggles in life. While reading The Art of War, I could not help but see enemy armies as challenges that try to hold me back from success. I saw each strategy as a way to handle different obstacles that arise in day to day life. I recall this one time in particular where I applied the rules of combat from The Art of War. I was training at my martial arts academy and was partnered up with a much younger student at the time. I was trying to help him understand the point of maintaining a ready position so he would not hold a guard at only one position at a time, therefore leaving himself wide open elsewhere. I used a lesson from The Art of War to help him understand this idea, and by the end of practice he was doing much better. I would recommend this book to all age groups, men, and women. I feel that everyone who has an open mind can benefit greatly after reading The Art of War. This book was written hundreds of years ago and still maintains frightfully accurate information on how to handle yourself during war. I wonder if Sun Tzu intended his book to be so versatile on its potential for self help. I think that General Tzu was much wiser than people give him credit for, and that this book will remain on my shelf for years to come. "
"127",126,"Mauro Marchisotti","My review refers to an (old) italian translation (L'arte della Guerra).I find this book a masterpiece of strategy, centuries before Machiavelli.For those who are familiar with 'Marketing Management' by Philip Kotler you will find the first concept of SWAT analysis.....(Strong / Weak points, opportunities / threats....) "
"128",127,"Matt Sautman","An artifact of its time, Sun Tzu's Art of War has transcended its initial uses as a manual for war tacticians into a manual for any variation of nonmilitary perceived warfare, especially within the realm of business. Having not read the original manuscript, it is difficult to know for certain if the translation has given the text an aura of self-help feel or if Sun Tzu innovated much of the genre of self-help over 2500 years ago. Either way, for a person who choses to take notes as one reads as opposed to reading it ""dry,"" there is much to take away from the book dealing with management, the art of division, hypotheses of war effects on economies, etc. The beauty in Sun Tzu's philosophy blends elements of the Loazi's Taoism and business management that strikes the reader as altogether modern, as if it had been written for the Western world within a contemporary context. Once having studied it, the reader will not see the world entirely as she/he had before (as all good books should do) and (ideally) she/he will think more strategically about her/his everyday interactions. I cannot make complete guarantees, but this is my conjecture as it currently stands. Since having read it, I see everything from chess and checker games to active shooter training in context of it. Perhaps the same will be true for you."

"137",136,"Makai Freeman","My book review on the book THE ART OF WAR and what I thing and fell about it. The first thing I thought about this book was that it was very interesting. I have never read a book on how to take out another army in so many techniques and strategies. I was so festinated by the rules and laws that they had to go places and do certain things. That is the first reason why I like this book. The second reason why I like this book is because there are a lot of things you can learn from it, for instance it could tell you how to take you enemy out within a matter of time. Also it tells you how to take over your enemy’s empire and turn it into you own to rule. Another interesting thing is that they will make sure they will win the battle before they even start the battle. If they did not plan out all of their battles then they could have lost and died. That is the second reason why I like this book.The final reason why I like this book is because it is the most important of life and fighting style that we use today. Also because our ancestors would use this as a guide to lead them to victory in the war. Another cool thing that you can learn is how to sneak into the enemy empire to plan an attack for your army to come in. the last thing is that it is a great experience to read how armies would win their wars. That is why I like this book and the reason why I am doing my book review on it."

"147",146,"Brendan Ahern","My book was very good educational and very easy to comprehend. It takes place in the warring era's of Asia/ Middle East. Basically all it is Master Sun Tzu's ideals and beliefs of how to succeed using military strategies and is translated/ explained by other war lords into their own perception. He explains the true art of warfare, what I mean by that is, Business, War, Chess, Football, Lax etc.. The object is to win and only the person with the right strategies, mindset and follow through will win in all things I just mentioned. This book teaches you the art of warfare and has strategies and saying to which every military to this day uses. The best thing I took from this book is the power of control of your mind body and spirit. Knowledge from this book can be translated into everyday uses and has personally helped me. My favorite quote and probably one of his most famous quotes was ""When Superior, Act Inferior"" Now it took me a while to truly understand the depth of which this was written and when i go it my eyes were truly opened. What is said is not to show your hand, let people think youre weak so you're under estimated therefore you have an advantage. Even when you know you're superior let people explain to you why it is that they are right and you're wrong, empowering them gives them hubris which can ultimately lead to their demise. Thats what this book has taught me that's just one quote that i really took a liking to and theirs a book full of them."

"156",155,"Laala Alghata","“So it is said: Know the enemy, Know yourself, And victory Is never in doubt, Not in a hundred battles.” — The Art of War by Sun-TzuIt a wonderful book. Of course, it’s a piece of literature that’s survived 2,500 years and people still quote it, so if I were to trash it I wouldn’t count anyway. But its great, whether taken literally (if you’re a soldier/general etc) or if taken metaphorically. The latter is the way I read it, of course. I’ve been going through some things and honestly, The Art of War is better than any self-help book. If only because I’d read this and there’s no chance in hell you’d catch me with a self-help book. Anyway, find yourself a copy, read it, pass it around. "

Такое у меня было только после прочтения ""Веры падших"" Терри Гудкайнда. Сейчас же было неожиданностью, что меня так зацепило. Купив себе издание ВСЛ я не пожалела. Во-первых: качество самого издания. Кремовая плотная бумага, оригинальные вставки китайского текста и шрифты. Читать одно удовольствие. Во-вторых: качество перевода. Сразу видно, что над текстом работали долго. Выдержан стиль старого наречия, и, что удивительно, на украинском хоть слова были старые, понимались без особого труда. Были еще сноски на некоторых моментах, но они не напрягали. Лаконично, информативно и ясно. В-третьих: подобная книга действительно должна быть в личной библиотеке. Над ней ты думаешь. Пропускаешь через себя. Вполне возможно, ты начнешь мыслить немного иначе после ее прочтения. Подмечать ранее не замеченные детали. Лучше разбираться в психологии людей. Да, именно в психологии. Не смотря на то, что книга называется ""Искусство войны"", в ней очень много психологии и минимум советов по поводу проведения самих боев. Если задуматься, то война действительно полностью состоит из психологических аспектов воздействия на людей. Как на солдат, так и на мирных граждан. Мышление Сунь-дзи не теряет свою актуальность даже по прошествии стольких тысячелетий. Многие его советы можно использовать в бизнесе. Ты только выиграешь если прислушаешься к его наставлениям. В общем: советую для общего развития. Это не та книга которую нужно ""глотать"". Ее нужно читать вчитываясь и обдумывая каждый абзац. Иначе толку будет никакого. А подумать там есть над чем.

"164",163,"Sebastian.t","The Art of War, by Sun Tzu , is one of the most interesting books I’ve read in a long time. The book expresses the importance of strategy within war, as well as using your surroundings to your advantage. The book speaks of different constants that happen as well as rules to follow. Much of the book speaks of suggestions. One of the many “rules” you should follow are not to engage you’re enemy when he has the higher ground. This can be taken literally or metaphorically. There are many of these “rules” and “laws” that you are to battle by, but the book also describes what the perfect balance is in how to lead, or what a leader should be like, as well as what a soldier should be. I found the book to be very helpful and it read out to sound very wise. It makes you feel smarter when reading it. I don’t think it was for my age group, but I enjoyed it nevertheless. I would not recommend the book to those who are very self-centered, nor to people who care not for strategy. However, I highly recommend the book to those who enjoy strategy. "

I think the most likely criticism I could imagine hearing is that it's just a bunch of very basic military tactics, which it is, but the fact that this one work is really the grounds on which generations and generations of leaders have based their strategy is pretty impressive. This book is 2400 years old! And all of the strategies and theories are fully applicable today, both on the battlefield or in any other sort of adversarial setting.

"181",180,"Ericy Yine","Day 1/middle: page 29 - So far the book has talked about how to prepare an army for combat and plan out the battlefield and the route and strategies along with what to do in a desperate or planned retreat. It has also revealed the common weak points in an army, or how to spot one and how to deal with one. I predict that the book will, chances are, talk about the types of situations to do what and its alternatives as it has not briefed on that yet, and should be an important factor.Finished: The book has talked on the different types of terrain to avoid or put it to your benefit, and the different cases your army could get into, and what to do in that case. It has talked on how to use fire in war properly and the procedures. Lastly the uses of spies and their importance in the army. Overall, the book specifically states all the possible situations and precautions one should take to ensure victory. This is the book for all the general's needs and to lead him on to victory. Quite strangely the strategies in the book has even helped me in my strategy war game!I recommend this book to anyone looking for pro strategies in a strategy game, or to any fan of history.I picked up this book when I was browsing the online book store and found this book on it, while I could not find a copy anywhere else, so got the book in curiosity of strategies used in war.I finished this book because of the strategies he used and the strategies to come and of plain curiosity."

"203",202,"Conrad Zero","A masterpiece of Eastern philosophy. Applicable to so much more than just military tactics if you have the slightest imagination. The introduction by Nigel Cawthorne gives slight detail about Sun Tzu and the history of the text. The uncredited afterward ""How Sun Tzu's Strategies Can Help In Business And Other Areas"" is a lovely bonus section, pointing out the book's influence on recent military, business, marketing and culture.This particular edition is worth tracking down just for the binding. The book itself is wrapped in rich, red satin with gold-foil inlay, and then boxed in a sturdy, hard-case. Every page of the book is beautifully illustrated. If you're going to keep a copy of this on your shelf, this is the version to have."

"208",207,"R.M.F Brown","Given the importance of warfare as a factor that drove human civilization since its inception, and given the stellar reputation that the art of war has accrued for itself over the centuries, I find it remarkable that such an important treatise could be...well...short! Succinctly written, simple without ever being simplistic, the art of war stands the test of time as one of the greatest philosophical works known to mankind. Far from being a weakness, its brevity is its greatest strength - the important lessons of war condensed into practical ideas that never become over-complicated - a vital lesson hard won from the fires of battle. Who was Sun Tzu? We shall never know, but his universal truths regarding warfare shall forever be known, studied, modified and adapted, because for as long as humans abound, war will follow in their wake. "

"218",217,"Ahmet","that's a book to re-read in need. The initial main take-away thoughts were the necessity of information and avoidance & management of conflicts. I might re-read some chapters in more details and putting more thought if I need to recall some ideas/perspectives."

"220",219,"Nana Fredua-Agyeman","Sun Tzu's The Art of War (Oxford University Press, 1963; 197 (Originally written in 500 BCE and translated by Samuel B. Griffiths)) is one book that has inspired several other books. It's been applied to various fields from business to friendship and more. In this book, Sun Tzu discusses what a good General should do if he is to win wars. The discusses almost everything that one needs to do and know about war and its effects from war-induced inflation to food shortages that accompanies it.read the rest here http://freduagyeman.blogspot.com/2012..."

"227",226,"Azhar Ali","A book written about war strategy became corner stone for management professionals. Written almost 3 millenia ago whole book is still valid no matter where you want to apply it, be it war, management or self success."
"228",227,"Adwait Kulkarni","Intensely loved and respected and very equally panned, The Art Of War stands as one of the finest look at management and strategy.Although many of its ideas may seem very commonplace and trivial, the beauty of the text lies not in following it to its word, but adapting and interpreting it as one's context.Highly recommended to people having a taste for management and strategy."
"230",229,"Marthese Formosa","on the front of my edition, it says it's the most influential strategy book in the world. I didn't read that until I realized how good it was though.I think this book is a classic because of it's flexibility. There are some parts where he speaks about geography that are applicable only in battle situations (unless you are running away from something, in which case it is handy to think about them), but there were sections where I was seeing parallels between what he was saying and strategy in an activist campaign!For being so short, like many Chinese classics, it needs a lot of thought. He offers very realistic and ethical strategies. Some we probably already know, some we haven't thought about. I don't want to spoil anything since it's so short, but I definitely recommend reading it. It's very worthwhile. For sure, take notes on the side on how they can be applied to different contexts. Some things which he seems to say are:-Protect your own-Hide your intentions-Be adaptable-A good general (leadership) is crucial-Do not obey orders if they do not make sense-Sometimes alliances are needed-Be kind to your enemies-Spies are neededHe also classifies a lot of things that will make the reading easy and at the end he joins some things together in a sort of summary which I appreciated.

"277",276,"Robert Martinez","If I had one word to describe this book, it would be ""Classic"". If I had two words to describe the Art of War they would be ""Classic strategy"", and with three words I would throw Military between the two. However and most unfortunate for my readers I have more then three words to describe it and will now proceed to use that liberty. It is a book that all young men should read early in life as well as often. Even if they cannot fully grasp the better part of Sun Tzu's meaning in his masterful work. As they get older they will learn the full concepts of the strategies that Sun Tzu puts forward, and grow up, as did I as a fan of this ancient book. But in essence I mean to say it is never to early for an army man loving, action figure playing, toy gun marksmen of a young man, to read (or have someone read him) The Art of War. By: Sun Tzu. This is one of my all time favorite books. Not to be read in a day of even two, it is not a book that will have you reading it long into the night, for by that time, unlike with most other books your mind will be far to tired to comprehend the full depth of what Master Sun is saying in the “greatest classic military strategy book of all time.” Robert L.D.CLR"

"308",307,"Ria","A fascinating treatise dealing with all forms of ""the art of war.""Although credited to Sun Tzu the version I had mentions many interpretations, commentators and amendments so in fact I find it very hard to decide WHICH parts are the actual work of the accredited author.Although apart from that the whole work was very interesting, although as intimated by the title it is to do with military warfare SOME of these hints and tips can be applied in real life such as ""know your enemy"" this kind of practicality can also be applied in real life.Sieges, tactics, provisions, prisoners, interaction with the armies and officers all topics are covered.Overall a great, interesting read that will appeal to practically anyone who has an interest in the great classics as this is not just a daunting military epic that might put potential readers off."

The part that sticks in my mind the most is the idea of practicing the moral law. If more leaders would employ this in the U.S., we would have a much stronger nation. "
"312",311,"Jose E. Santiago","This book is really interesting that I would recommend to other people to read. It has really interesting tactics that are currently used in the U. S. Military. However, it also explains, many tactics used in modern wars such as the civil war, World War I and World War II and the Vietnam war. Many tactics are even used in sports such as basketball,soccer and even American football. It's a great book, that would give you the history of major wars and how the weaker won the stronger and how slaughter doesn't matter in war, as long as you don't under estimate your opponent. It will give you a much more understanding about how countries won wars with the littlest military power. "
"313",312,"Debbie","The Art of War teaches the way an honorable and smart general leads his troops into battle and the measures that he has to take to be the victor. From this book, I learned how to take the battlefield that Sun Tzu talks about in his book and to apply it to the business world and to the world of academic achievement. They are both battles and if you have the right tools and the proper direction, you can definitely win the battle. "

"388",387,"Erica Herold"," “The Art of War” by Sun-Tzu is probably one of the most interesting reads for all ages. Despite the title, the reader can walk away from this work with more than just war tactics. Though the book centers on ancient warfare methods, one can find themselves applying particular methods to every day situations. The book offers tips for being prepared for success in any situation and that can apply to school, work, or any other personal complications that someone may face. 	Sun-Tzu divides the book into thirteen chapters, the first being “Laying Plans”, which explains how a commander can calculate his chances of victory. “Waging War” explains how to understand the economy of warfare and how to make decisive engagements quickly. “The Plan of Attack” defines the source of strength as unity, not size, and discusses the five factors that are needed to succeed in any war: attack, strategy, alliances, army, and cities. The remaining chapters are all equally informational and really explain matters such as tactics, directing orders, spotting weak points and strengths, and maneuvering resources as well as creating variations in plans and tactics. 	These guidelines are all extremely helpful for any situation that life may throw out at a person and it was a fun and easy read. It was interesting how such ancient tactics can still be used in multiple situations even today. I would definitely recommend this book to all ages because it’s helpful to see ideas and tactics that have been proven successful for difficult situations at any age. "

"398",397,"Pavel Panchekha","Brilliant and pithy. I think reading this improved my Go game by 2k."
"400",399,"Rick Marcello","This is not my first time reading this book. I read it again for the sake of this review. The author of the original manuscript is the Sun-Tzu and the translator for this version is Lionel Giles. The genre is military history and of course the title of the book fits in very well with the reading. The version I have is the one from Barnes and Noble classics. All chapters of the without commentary amount to 72 pages but the book has commentary included and the total amount of pages comes to 273.My curiosity for originally reading this work came from the general impression that this book can be applied to all facets of life, not just war. Businessmen for example have been reading this book to apply it to their dealings with others. This book, if you are focused, is a very quick read. Like I previously stated, the book covers all chapters within 72 pages. However the material is rehashed with commentary for in depth study. There are so many memorable quotes from the text. We all know the famous line ""All warfare is based on deception."" I would love to add more but it would be a lot more fun to read the book for yourself and pick the quotes that you like the most. Giles does a great job with the organization of the text it really is a joy to read.If I had to pick an arena of life where this book is most applicable I would say it would be sports. In the chapters ""Attack by Statagem"" and ""Tactical Dispositions"" the book mentions the way of the truly skillful fighter. When I read the chapter I immediately thought of a boxer, planning a way to beat his opponent. The book appealed to me in both a logical and emotional way. I saw the sense in Sun Tzu philosophy when he is dealing with both war strategy and tactics. It also captured my imagination on how I can apply the principles in a sport like setting. Although the book is used for business strategy, I find it a stretch. Maybe 10% to 15% of the material can be used for business. In age of transparency, the deception model of business transactions do not work. Also business is about profit which can be earned with or without direct competition whereas in sports and in war victory is the goal and there is always an opposing force. I highly recommend this book. It is only $4.95 from Barnes and Noble and even cheaper if you can get it online. "

In addition to its value as a work on strategy, it’s a damned good guide to dealing with human beings in general. As with any work of genius, multiple readings are necessary even to get an inkling of what Sun Tzu was writing about. Learning to apply his principles is even more challenging. My favorite version so far (and I admit that I’m biased, as I like the publishing company) is the Shambhala Dragon Edition, translated and edited by Thomas Cleary. Cleary’s translation contains commentary by later strategists such as Cao Cao and Wang Xi. I don’t think it’s possible to grasp even the mid-level application of Sun Tzu’s principles without a basic familiarity with the Tao Te Ching – another work that requires a lifetime of study.

Every time I find myself at a loss for maintaining momentum and dominance in conflict resolution, I consult Sun Tzu. If I'm unsure how to proceed when striving to impress a person in a particular way, I re-read ""The Art of War"". Should I fail to develop a protocol for getting what I want out of any given situation, I'll find what I need in this classical treatise on strategy.Sun Tzu breaks the battlefield down into its most basic components, and explores the roles each play to either victory or defeat. He was an astute psychologist long before Freud and the Viennese Schools ever existed, tapping into inexorable truths of human thinking and behavior alongside observation of history to derive his conclusions. All of his indicated observations of warfare can be transposed to virtually any scenario that can exist between people. I've come to find his wisdom applying to intrapersonal matters as well, particularly in defeating anxiety, despair, fear, doubt, and insecurity.I wouldn't attempt any kind of negotiation, investment, pursuit, or a romantic conquest without finding its equivalent situation in this book. Yup, ""The Art of War"" is the most useful work one can consult when dating, too--not joking. "

I want to win this fight and recommend it for everyone who doesn't feel well or is passing through a hard time of their lives but now I will no longer talk about me and begin talking about the book.How was the book? The book The Art of War is about a war in china translated and the book was written by Sun Tzu because he was the commander those times and to understand it I will summarize it. The first 150 pages contain a summary history of China leading up to the time when the book was written and explains the context in which the book was written. In these pages he explains the types of weapons, armor, vehicles, agriculture, political organization of the time period. The book itself as the story is about 80o pages. In the ""story"" he explains the strategy and tips and how was the war The last major section is the end notes to the first 250 pages. This section is about 80 pages long but the text is MUCH smaller than the rest of the book and leaves very fewer blank pages or gaps. It probably amounts to 100-150 pages if made the same text size as the rest of the book.What was it about?The art of War is a book about warfare. It happened centuries ago in China where Sun Tzu explains how the landscapes, unity, freedom, strategy, harmony,restriction,danger,security,distances were important for war because Sun Tzu believed that war can be defeated before starting it because the commanders need to plan everything and have to prepared to win. Then Sun Tzu explains the war and how to manage the plan depending the situation. Giving the reader tips.Who should read The Art of War? ""The art of war"" is a must read for anyone who wants to be successful. You don't become successful by reinventing the match. You become successful by imitating success and understanding the match why something is successful and adapting those rules to your actions. Sun Tzu said it best in the book with the best words ""the battle is won before the sword is drawn"". This quote is powerful and it is true when you reflect about war. My paragraph above is simplified in this quote. Read this book, keep it, as I have as a reference source to be successful in life and then reread it every time you want to accomplish something and this book will let you to success. There are many useful examples of how more was accomplished with less."
"485",484,"Yosua","One of book that inspired me the most!"
"487",486,"Richard Norman","Sun Tzu’s The Art of War could be used as a business manual, is profound, and can teach you how to crush the opposition with little or no resources. Some people miss the modern-day application of this book. Though useful as a war manual, required reading, and studied at West Point Military academy, even today its philosophies are still as true as the day they were written. The Art of War in my opinion most likely influenced Sherman in his legendary march during the Civil War. In business the philosophy of dividing the competition and getting them to misuse expenditures, their research and development money, misappropriate their advertising, and using their Goliath strength against them and in your favor is the golden thread which has graced the robes of the shrewdest business man. Sun Tzu beat armies outnumbered 30 to 1 and took cities and provinces without a fight. Business that use such tactics end up on top! The trick in war or business is to get your opponent to respond in a way that is contrary to his best interests to expend money and manpower in order to defend what did not need defending. To get your business opponent to support movements of his company in counterproductive expensive activities, this kind of attack cost nothing and is not illegal. You can read The Art of War in an evening and spend months thinking about its application. Five stars is not enough! "

"501",500,"Stepan Babayan","Most books I read every day are not more than 400 years old (and I believe that others’ preferences do not fundamentally differ in this case) That’s I think quite normal because these books are authentic and are easy to read, as we are not experiencing any problems with vocabulary and the context itself. So, what if I give you a 2500-year-old book? You’ll probably not want to read it, as you’ll think that the vocabulary is difficult, and the content is, well, “old”. That’s not the case with Sun Tzu: The Art of War.First of all, who was Sun Tzu? He was a famous Chinese general, strategist and philosopher whose military texts were very popular during the Zhou dynasty. But “The Art of War” had a completely different destiny. The military text written 2500 years ago is nowadays known all over the world. The Vietnamese soldiers knew Sun Tzu by heart and used the tactics described in a 2500-year-old military text during the 20th century. A Japanese general Takeda Shingen fought in a war without using guns, because he relied on Sun Tzu’s tactics. Most Western companies only employ people for the position of CEO if they have read “The Art of War”. We can already anticipate many things about the book by these facts.“The Art of War” is a non-fiction book. It doesn’t have any storyline. It consists of 14 chapters, each of them filled with independent statements, which are useful pieces of advice about war by Sun Tzu. The book isn’t very long, yet it contains a lot of important information. Each chapter speaks about a certain aspect of war. For example, the first chapter is about laying the plans, how we should plan our attacks and by what factors we can estimate our future failure or success. The book contains a lot of philosophy. The most interesting thing is the fact that Sun Tzu’s strategies are used not only in the realm of military, but also in business, communication, international relationships and in many other realms. Don’t think that the book is filled with instructions about how to fight in the war. Sun Tzu mostly persuades us to avoid conflict if possible, and to capture the army instead of destroying it. Also, the book is filled with very “tough” quotes. The quotes like “All warfare is based on deception” became so popular that most of the people who know these quotes don’t even know that they are from “The Art of War”. The vocabulary of the book is very easy. I mean, it can’t be that you’ll know every single word from the book, but you’ll easily understand the meaning of every single sentence, that’s for sure. That’s quite strange for a book which was written 25 centuries ago. We should say thanks to Lionel Giles, who carefully translated the book from the original Chinese into English in 1910 and managed to keep the philosophy and meaning of the book unchanged. (My review is based on Giles’ translated version).Reading “The Art of War” is absolutely not boring. Every part of the book is completely unique and different from the other parts. You’ll probably never read a book like “The Art of War”. Not that it’s the best book in the world, I can’t say that. But it’s unique by its age, it’s unique by its way of expressing ideas, it’s unique by the arrangement of the information in the context, it’s unique by its information. We can even leave out the positive sides of the book because it is so popular all over the world that I think every person should read it in any case. Nobody will be disappointed."

"503",502,"Chris Summer","I read ""The Art of War"" out of pure curiosity. I don't have anything to do with war, I'm not a soldier or anything like that. But I found this book really good. Except some parts that seemed kind of ""too much"". But I can understand that if someone is desperate would surely use them. The book is so old but it's still modern. The art of war would never change. What may -and will- change is the equipment (guns and stuff) but the strategy seems the same, to me personally. And Sun Tzu knows about that. He knows a lot about that. He explains it so simply, as if he thought of it easily and there's nothing complicated about what you should do in every situation. And as you read the book you think that ""Yes! That's what I would do"" or ""This is the best thing to do if...""I don't know if I'm explaining this the way I want but I think you get the general idea. It's a really good book. I can understand why it's a classic and I'd reccomend it to anyone. It's like 100 pages long so it won't take too much of your time if you think you won't like it.Anyways, that's about it.

"528",527,"Philippe Mansour","From the commanders in the battle fields of Ancient China nearly 2,000 years ago to the current Officers of the armed forces around the world, almost all of them have read or been educated upon Sun Tzu’s “The Art of War”. This book writes down the ‘declared rules of war’ that recently had just been generally known by the military itself. Although the book bases its writings off ancient Chinese wars and their history, one should not misunderstand its content. The book should in reality be called “A Step by Step Instructional Guide on How to Win Your Life”. Whether it is a literal military battle or daily struggles that one faces in life, be it school or business, this book is a great guide on how to succeed. Sun Tzu presents the reader with almost every situation of a battlefield and provides them with multiple solutions. A few things that can be learned from this book is one must not always obey their leader, never put yourself into a tight situation, if everyone is not in it together then failure is sure to happen, knowing the knowledge of your terrain will lead you to victory, work with instead of fighting against your terrain, and most importantly, if one can reveal information about his enemy then with no hesitance do it. These are just a few of the many lessons that can be extracted from “The Art of War”. With these entire life lessons one would think that this book will be a tough one to handle, however that is not the case. The beauty of Sun Tzu’s book is that despite presenting its reader with almost every situation one can face in life, it does it in a manner that is easy to read and in a length that does not even trip the triple digit scale, 99 pages."
"529",528,"Rick Allen","Less about war itself, than it is an assertive and magnanimous approach to leadership. Folly would be taking Art of War at face value, which is a millennially-antiquated battle handbook. This is daily philosophy for interacting with people, using literal war as allegory. Considering the diminutive length, this should be read by anyone and everyone. "
"533",532,"Jason Yang","This is the first book I've read on military strategy and philosophy. What a compelling work! It was quickly apparent how the teaching ascribed to Sun Tzu have a timeless quality.Sun Tzu advises that to overcome, one must know themselves and know their enemies; that warfare is both physical and psychological; that discipline and will are fundamental. Reflecting on his teachings on advancement and defense also help me to better understand some of our rugby set plays.All in all, an excellent Chinese classic. Definitely something I would read and re-read in the future."
"534",533,"Captain Buckwheat","512 BC Tradition claims that the text was written in this year.206 BC - AD 220 The oldest copy of The Art of War has been dated to this time.1782 Translated into a European language for the first time by Frenchman Jean Joseph Marie Amiot, a Toulon-born Jesuit missionary who had been living in Peking since 1751. Amiot worked at the court of the Qianlong emperor and devoted his life to fostering Franco-Chinese relations. He was a chief correspondent with Louis XVI's government on Chinese matters. When Amiot learnt on October 8, 1793 of the execution of Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette by revolutionaries, he was so overwhelmed by the news that he died that very night. Amiot's translation was - to put it mildly - awful, and bore little resemblance to the actual text. It was, however, read with interest by some members of the French establishment. Outside of this, however, it was not a significant translation.1905 Translated into English for the first time by one Captain Everard Ferguson Calthrop, RFA, who was dwelling in Tokyo at the time. The translation was made with the assistance of ""two Japanese gentlemen"". The text was revised in 1908 and published in London. Both editions are awful; Calthrop skips difficult-to-translate passages and butchers everything to pieces. Calthrop also inserts commentary by anonymous Japanese scholars who, for all we know, may very well have just been the two translators who assisted him. The text is a corrupt, Chinese-to-Japanese-to-English mess of no historical value. Whether it had any impact on the book's popularity I really don't know.1910 The first scholarly English-language version appears, written by one Dr. Lionel Giles. This would become the definitive edition of the text for over fifty years. In his introduction, Dr. Giles cites the awful 1905 edition of the Calthrop translation as one of his motivations for writing his own edition. It was written primarily for members of the academic community who held an interest in the Chinese language and in Chinese literature. This was the first edition to achieve any popularity.1944 The Giles translation is re-edited and published in the United States for the first time as part of a series of military science books, no doubt to be read by members of the armed forces. Its republication by the American military itself can be seen as a testament to its growing popularity among anglophone readers.1963 The first 'popular' (as opposed to 'scholarly') translation of the text, by Samuel B Griffith, is published. This translation was considered equal to the Giles translation and is still in print. (source reddit)"

La battaglia, lo scontro, sono l'ultima risorsa.Come qualsiasi saggezza, anche quella di Sun Tzu è espressa in modo semplice, la difficoltà sta nel coglierla e saperla applicare.Infatti bisogna accettare di non dover attaccare se non ci sono le condizioni giuste, adeguarsi allo stato delle cose e cogliere il momento giusto per agire, allenare il corpo e raccogliere conoscenze per quando quel momento arriverà ma anche saper porre le basi per creare momenti propizi sconvolgendo la strategia del nemico.Cosa più importante, bisogna agire non per distruggere il nemico, ma solo per vincerlo e se ciò può portare un vantaggio. La frase che meglio riassume il Sun Tzu è ""conquistare intero e intatto il nemico"" ma per comprendere il significato di questa frase e tutta la saggezza di questo stile di vita bisogna leggere il libro.

"556",555,"Andrew Ye","I originally chose this book because after I watched the movie Wall Street 1987 version, Gordon Gekko, a wall street broker has many of his ways from The Art of War. I was interested in how a book that is thousands of years old can still have an impact in our modern businesses. This book taught me that conflict is an inevitable part of life, but everything that is necessary to deal with it is also present. The main idea within this book is that it is that it is better not to fight than to be involved in a conflict, but if you are going to have to fight, then you have to do it to win, and these are the various strategies, that will get you that result. ""The wise warrior evades the battle""(Tzu,37). His book teaches you how to be a better leader and how to deal with people which are important in every aspect of life and war.""If your enemy is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him. If your opponent is temperamental, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them. If sovereign and subject are in accord, put division between them. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected”(Tzu, 68). The philosophy in this book can change a person because it makes you think what should you do and what you do can change how you act which can change the environment you are in. I understood how Gekko used the philosophy in this book to do business because the stock market are full of risks you take. The principles in this book can change how you act in a situation like that. The principles in this book can be used in every aspect of life which can change people."

What most remarkable, though, is that even though it's obvious Sun Tzu was a genious, he speaks simply.

I bring this book up in conversations more than I can count and I'm thankful I've read The Art of War. I use to be, still am, introverted and quiet. I put other people's needs before mine and always end up screwing myself over. After figuring out that people took advantage of my niceness and took me for granted, I realized it was time to change my attitude. The Art of War helped me with the adjustment. Not only did the Art of War talk about strategy in war, anyone can apply the rules in the Art of War in daily aspects and conflicts in their life. I can still be nice, but more firm and assertive. I can panic and be upset inside, but I'll stay calm and put together on the outside. Basically a ""fake it til you make it"" tactic."
"576",575,"Bryan Simmons","Short and sweet. I really like the emphasis placed on non-violence by Sun Tzu. Of course it must be acknowledged that avoiding all conflict is not possible. But, so poignantly stated by Sun Tzu, ""to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting."" A cogent point is also made about pride. Over and over Sun Tzu warns against fighting when it is not needed. Fighting just to prove a point is not, as he would say, ""supreme excellence."" To the modern reader then, the true art addressed is not HOW to fight so much as a reminder of how careful we should be about WHEN to fight. "

It did not disappoint. Tips like fighting the enemy where they aren't and making it seem like you are weak when your strong, really progressed my understanding of war tactics.I recommend this book to people who enjoy reading about strategies, not just for war but for the knowledge.

"636",635,"Fulton Zinser","This book is honestly one of the most interesting books I have read but also requires an interest in anything war related. If you're wondering why, it's because this book doesn't have a story to it at all. No, no, no, you see, this book is all about how you should go about war. Things that you should strive for, and things you should avoid. For example, he talks about how you should always be stealthy and have your enemy never predict your attacks. Also about how you shouldn't stay in a war too long because the economy will start falling apart. The best part of this ancient text is how accurate it still is today. The majority of the book is still taught today and commanders in the army all read this text to archive the knowledge that is inside. If you are the type of person that would be interested in war and how to go about battles, though you probably won't find this information useful, then definitely pick up this book and enjoy the heck out of it. If you aren't a fan of war then go back to your Judy B. Jones novels you used to always read back in elementary school and gloat about constantly. I honestly can't stand people who think they are special after reading a Judy B. Jones book even though any girl with a childhood read that book. It's almost as bad as that stupid Twilight fad that caused a war between Twilight fans and Twilight haters. The only thing worse than an overly obsessive Twilight fan is a person who tries to explain to you why Twilight is a bad movie and book. I bet that's a war not even Sun Tzu can tell you how to go about. Oh wow, I just realized how off topic I got. Oh jeez... Ummmmm..... Wow I messed up my last book review.... Shoot.......... Bye."

"658",657,"Jaclyn","In ART OF WAR, there is a rare thing in books in which all of it or most of it can relate to many things. If the reader uses some of these war tactics and strategies in the modern world, they may find it easy to relate. Business is war, but in a different scenario than actual battles. Thus it is easy to relate to this book. Even rivals in sports and entertainment can be outwitted by the wisdom in this book. It also adds examples of some actions, which show how these sayings and writings apply to the real world.So no matter what you were looking for in this book, whether it be business, entertainment, sports, war games, actual wars, or even travel, you can be sure to learn more on how to attack life here.The book's age is hard and easy to see at the same time. You can tell that it was written thousands of years ago by what Sun Tzu tells of. (Chariots, gold pieces are currency, etc...), but some of the grammar and language are shown well in the translation in the book, making it easy to read in English as well as other languages you would be able to find the book in.The only weakness of this book would have to be its accented topic towards foreign countries, and much older devices. The way to break through this is for the reader to be able to translate it into his/her life."
"660",659,"Raina Verhey","This is an ultimate classic. The direction in this book goes well beyond the battlefield, entering into the ideas of social interactions and basic life structures. A man who deals with his business as Sun Tzu dealt with his war, would be a wise man indeed. "
"663",662,"Mila Dorji","So I actually read a different edition of this book: the Denma Translation from Shambhala Classics. That said, I think that the essential message of the book, and much of the actual text, is similar (if not identical) in both versions. I found this to be almost more of a meditative experience than a book in the conventional sense of the word. That is to say my usual tense, excited attitude when reading a novel was replaced by a sense of peacefulness and calm. One particular excerpt reads:""As for the nature of trees and rocks- When still, they are at rest. When agitated, they move. When square, they stop.  When round, they go.Thus the shih of one skilled at setting people to battle is like rolling round rocks from a mountain one thousand jen high.""It is exactly this unembellished writing style that allows the crucial underlying messages of the Art of War to pass smoothly from text to mind without the usual laborious process of trying consciously to retain and understand information. Through its metaphors, comparisons, and simple writing style, The Art of War relays a set of complex, immensely wise ideas from ancient China directly into the modern world. Loved it :)"

O livro escolhido para início desta longa jornada foi justamente A Arte da Guerra.Pude identificarem várias passagens do livro comportamentos que já possuía, outros que via nas pessoas com quem convivo além de tantos outros que passaria a observar melhor.Impressionante o quão atual são os ensinamentos de Sun Tzu! Tão simples e antigos mas ao mesmo tempo tão atuais que parece terem sido escritos ontem por um desses escritores de livros de auto ajuda.Fica nítido que os grandes valores de qualquer negócio, ou batalha, está atrelado ao racional, ao fator humano. Valores como respeito, humildade, simplicidade e objetividade além da pratica do planejamento genuíno são indispensáveis para o sucesso.Sun Tzu valoriza o triunfo sem a destruição do adversário. No nosso dia a dia, podemos comparar às relações ganha-ganha, ao trabalho em equipe e ao reconhecimento dos resultados das equipes envolvidas nas tarefas desprezando-se a monopolização das atenções para o líder quando há sucesso ou escolha por parte deste de um culpado no fracasso."

"674",673,"Maryange","Une bible de stratégie et de management !"
"675",674,"Andre Soares","SUN TZU foi um grande general que viveu na China estimadamente 200 anos antes de Cristo. Sua obra famosa chama-se “A Arte da Guerra”, e foi traduzida e estudada detalhadamente em todo o mundo ocidental. Suas idéias foram e ainda são amplamente aplicadas tanto na guerra como na paz. Sun Tzu (Sun Wu) foi também um filósofo antes de se tornar um general invencível, e discute neste livro todos os aspectos da guerra, do tático ao humano, numa linguagem ao mesmo tempo penetrante e poética.Esse pensador escreveu um tratado sobre a guerra que até hoje serve como inspiração a políticos, empresários e até treinadores de futebol. No livro 'A arte da Guerra', o autor explica, em uma das mais significativas passagens, que para se vencer uma batalha, além de se conhecer o adversário é fundamental a presença do autoconhecimento no front. Sem a noção exata de nossos defeitos e virtudes não podemos almejar grandes conquistas, por mais que estejamos preparados.Ao ler esse livro, muitas pessoas podem se perguntar: qual a inter-relação entre a “Arte da Guerra” e a Administração? Contudo, como se verá a seguir, o livro de SUN TZU está intimamente ligado às estratégias de negócios e à arte do gerencimento.A relação entre o livro ora analisado e a Administração pode ser traduzida em apenas três palavras: “táticas, planos e estratégias”, as quais, por sua vez, estão contidas em uma outra: “planejamento”. Na guerra, um exército possui inimigos mortais aos quais precisa vencer. Para tanto, é preciso conhecer as intenções desse mesmo inimigo, bem como seu potencial de ataque e defesa. Na Administração não é diferente. Uma organização também possui inimigos mortais, cuja concorrência direta ameaçam sua sobrevivência. Para vencê-los, e preciso também conhecer seu potencial de ataque (capacidade de produção, rede de distribuição, mercado, preços, público-alvo etc.), além de conhecer, ainda, suas defesas (produtos novos a serem lançados, promoções de vendas, táticas de marketing etc.).Em uma guerra, para que se possa vencer o inimigo é preciso, de um lado, conhecer ao máximo esse inimigo; e, de outro, preparar-se ao máximo para o combate. Na Administração dá-se a mesma situação. Assim, deve-se entender que, tal qual na guerra, quando uma organização investe em treinamento ou reciclagem de funcionários, equivale ao esforço dos exércitos para fazer com que seus soldados sejam melhores que os soldados das fileiras inimigas. Da mesma forma, quando uma empresa encomenda uma pesquisa de mercado, isso nada mais é que a versão capitalista moderna da espionagem. Afinal, o que se quer é fazer o levantamento dos pontos fortes e fracos que o oponente possui. Portanto, como se vê, não é por acaso que a frase mais famosa de “A Arte da Guerra” seja: “conheça o inimigo e conheça a si mesmo, e você pode lutar cem batalhas sem derrota”. Dessa forma, ressalta-se que, na era da globalização os ensinamentos de SUN TZU estão presentes nas estratégias empresariais e nas táticas de competição entre as empresas. Hoje, em função da acirrada competição pelo mercado, a empresa que não inovar esta fadada a mediocridade ou ao fracasso, por esta razão é que empresas bem sucedidas constantemente introduzem inovações em seus produtos. Em suma, gerenciar uma empresa não é muito diferente de comandar um exército, posto que o mercado é tão-somente uma forma aparentemente ‘pacífica’ de batalha.A obra de Sun Tzu aqui analisada é um rico livro de filosofia, não devendo ser estudada apenas por militares ou adeptos de esportes combativos. Ao contrário, pode ser lida por todos indiscriminadamente. Trata-se de uma lição de vida, um obra que visa ensinar o homem a postar com coragem e lógica diante dos fatos mais variados. A linguagem fácil, que não remete o leitor constantemente ao dicionário, faz desse livro algo perfeito para estudantes de qualquer grau, mas principalmente para aqueles cujos estudos se voltam para as áreas gerenciais (administradores, contadores, economistas etc.), visto que os ensinamentos contidos nessas poucas páginas são, em teor, maiores do que se pode encontrar na literatura convencional.

"678",677,"Kuv Patel","A book on strategy written over two thousand years ago. Translated into many languages including English, it's methods are accessible to everyone, from world leaders, military strategists, business executives, to the average person looking for ways of better managing their daily lives. Although the book is about warfare, the strategies discussed can be filtered into your own way of life. It does not encourage war, but shows that if war is inevitable, then victory can be achieved through such methods as planning, tactics, offensive strategy and many other methods from direct assault on the enemy to their destruction from within. Some great phrases in the book include: ""the enemy's vulnerability is of his own making"", ""we move when there is advantage to gain; we halt when there is none"", and ""when capable pretend to be incapable; when active, inactive; when near make the enemy believe you are far away."" The Art of War remains one of the most intriguing books I have read.

"692",691,"Vincent Buscemi","Written in 500 B.C. the ""Art of War""is not only a manual for practical military tactics but also a manual to which one can live their life by.Here are Sun Tzu's 13 laws for being victorious in war1. Laying plans ""The art of war is of vital importance to the state. It is a matter of life and death, a road to either safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.""2. Waging War""When you engage in actual fighting, if victory is long in coming,, the men's weapons will grow dull and their ardour will be damped. If you lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your strength. Again, if the campaign is protracted, the resource of the state will not be equal to the strain.""3.Attack by Stratagem""In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy's country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so profitable.""4.Tactical Dispositions""The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat and then waited the opportunity of defeating the enemy.""5.Use of Energy""The control of a large force is the same in principle as the control of a few men. It is merely a question of dividing up the numbers.""6. Weak points and strong""Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has hasten to the battle, will arrive exhausted.""7.Maneuvering an Army""The difficulty of tactical maneuvering consists of turning the devious into the direct and misfortune into gain.""8.Variation of tactics""There are roads which must not be followed, armies which must not be attacked, towns which must be besieged, positions which must not be contested, commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed.""9.The Army on the March""We now come to the question of encamping the army and observing signs of the enemy. Pass quickly over mountains and keep in the neighborhood of valleys.""10. Classification of Terrain""The natural formation of the country is the soldier' best ally; but a power of estimating the adversary, of controlling the forces of victory, and of shrewdly calculating difficulties, dangers and distances, constitutes the test of a great general.""11.The nine situations"" At first, exhibit the coyness of a maiden, until the enemy gives you an opening; afterwards emulate the rapidity of a running hare, and it will be too late for the enemy to oppose you.""12.Attack by fire""There are five ways of attacking with fire. The first is to burn soldiers in their camp; the second is to burn stores; the third is to burn baggage-trains; the fourth is to burn arsenals and magazines; the fifth is to hurl dropping fire amongst the enemy.""13.Use of Spies""What enables the wise sovereign and the good general to strike and conquer, and achieve things beyond the reach of ordinary men, is fore-knowledge."""

"709",708,"Austin Miller Bella Vista"," ""The Art of War"" was written over 2,500 years ago by Sun Tzu, a Chinese philosopher and general. It is not so much a story as a manual on warfare, and it passes a great deal of information on to the reader. Sun Tzu explains the thirteen factors in winning wars, while transforming war from a test of power to an art, in a surprisingly gripping and fascinating way. He delves into strategies that I would never have considered; he mentions incredibly well thought out retaliatory tactics. From laying plans, to waging wars, to winning them, Sun Tzu is very wise in explaining the road to victory. Even as short a book as this is, it is likely one of the most inspiring works of literature that I have ever read. I can't quite think of a genre to categorize this under, but I would recommend this book to nearly anyone."
"710",709,"Kyle Kays","Although written about combat, The Art of War applies to all aspects of life. When reading this I found many connections and applications to my everyday life.

From the depths of when to attack, to the 9 terrains. This book has it all. You can even relate this book to your own life.

Tzu describes the many elements and variables that go into maintaining and deploying an army. For example, traveling long distances and going without food can ""empty"" an army, making them vulnerable. Sun also says to avoid corruption at home while creating it in your enemies' ranks.

Even though it was written in the 6th century BC, you can apply the approach Sun Tzu uses for military combat to almost any conflict life can offer you.

"781",780,"Huw Evans","I first came across this as a reference in another book, I wot not which. I pursued it, found a copy and read avidly. The most incredible thing about the book is its historical aspect; written two thousand five hundred years ago at a time when we Celts thought wattle and daub was pretty smart and warfare was at its most bestial and basic. Small wonder it has become compulsory reading for the officer class. It has applications, however, throughout live in all fields. I have used its axioms repeatedly in medicine and I know that it has been reqorked as a management tool. It should be read by anybody who has an open mind and especially by anybody who professes an interest in China. "

"806",805,"Eric Kinney","""The Art of War"" is an ancient Chinese military doctrine widely believed to have been written by one of history's greatest military figures, Sun Tzu, who was a high-ranking general, strategist, and tactician in the 5th century BCE. Though a relatively short book, ""The Art of War"" consists of 13 chapters each covering one aspect of warfare, from the management of a state during periods of conflict, to understanding your enemy on the battlefield by respecting their advantages and exploiting their weaknesses. Despite it's background, ""The Art of War"" is not a celebration of the honor and glory of making battle, but an insightful warning of recklessness and abuse of power. As well, peace should always be the objective before any conflict; therefore the road to war as a last resort. If war must come, victory should be obtained quickly and not prolonged to cause further suffering abroad and at home. Historians and generals today believe that if Western civilization had embraced such counsel, many of Europe and America's bloodiest wars could have been avoided with fewer setbacks. Ironically, ""The Art of War"" is not only referred to by present military powers, but is also a practical guide for athletes, lawyers, and businessmen. Now, why exactly would a treatise on ancient Chinese warfare pertain to any of today's modern vocations? Simply put, many competitive industries value it's insightful philosophy concerning the essence of preparation, the calculation of risks in decision-making, and the many roles of leadership in obtaining one's objectives. Sun Tzu as a teacher instructs how to counter adversity through the employment of psychology, discipline, and awareness of your advantages and disadvantages (""He who knows when he can fight and when he cannot will be victorious."") ""The Art of War"" is an incredible book for anyone seeking self-improvement and empowerment, while understanding how to confront life's predicaments through the perspectives of a rational commander."

"819",818,"Alejandro","The art of war is an extremely subtle book that somehow expresses truly deep and complex concepts using a simple straight forward writing style. I find it is more of a general guide on how to live than a military handbook. All it requires is for the reader to use his imagination and find parallels in its day to day life. Thomas Cleary's version is in my opinion one of the best translations out there. Especially due to its incredible ""translaters introduction"" which masterfully introduces the reader into the prevailing taoist mentality under which the book was written. If you already read the Art of War and found it somewhat simple or weird or just plain unintelligible, read Thomas Cleary's introduction"

"822",821,"Sever","Well, the great nation of the Chinese, since old ages contributed with great knowledge to the universal development of the world in science, art, philosophy, culture and much much more.Sun Tzu's Art of War is not a military tactician's 101 lesson book.It teaches us how to approach conflicts, how to battle social circles, how to approach your foe and friend.A famous quote within the book is generally known as : All warfare is based on deception. Most cunning plans have been born from the idea of illusion and deception, mostly in social encounters between most people of a certain intellect and equally civilized.Either way, the book simply speaks for itself, every man must read it, in order to build his character, respect for one's opponent and the tactics to overcome one's issues in all fields possible."

"850",849,"Igor Veloso","Sempre quis ter este livro na minha Biblioteca e é sem dúvida indispensável na mesma. O motivo é simples e óbvio: permite de uma forma fria e pragmática analisar um problema ou uma situação e agir da forma mais eficaz. Não é necessário aspirar a ser um grande líder militar ou empresarial para entender e aplicar as ideias apresentadas. Este é um livro puramente pessoal e que cabe a cada um tirar o seu próprio partido do mesmo. A cultura asiática tem fama por dar valor ao introvertido, ao sábio e à eficácia, e ao ler, verá isto reflectido. Dou também os meus agradecimentos ao tradutor Lionel Giles e às suas notas, que foram igualmente indispensáveis para entender melhor os pontos apresentados em todos os capítulos. Se gostar de um auxilio para tomada de decisões e manter uma mente equilibrada, Recomendo.NOTA: Como não encontrei a versão de Lionel Giles no Goodreads, deixo menção e opinião nesta página.O que interessa é que a mensagem passe."

"862",861,"Veronica Morfi","I needed some help with an upcoming presentation and I decided to read The Art of War by Sun Tzu. It must have been one of my best choices. First of all, this book is brilliant. Yes, there are parts that are about the actual facts, food, money, ground of war and yes, those details won't help anyone who is just searching for some strategic help, but you have to remember that this book was written in 500 B.C. and it was about actual war. Otherwise, there are so many parts of this book that will help anyone who is in need of great advise to win over at any 'battlefield'.Here are some of my favorite quotes:""The way of war is a way of deception.""""I have heard that in war haste can be folly but have never seen delay that was wise.""""Ultimate excellence lies not in winning every battle but in defeating the enemy without ever fighting. The highest form of warfare is to attack strategy itself.""""Be ready for the unexpected.""""Know the enemy, know yourself, and victory is never in doubt, not in a hundred battles.""""Weakness stems from preparing against attack. Strength stems from obliging the enemy to prepare against an attack.""""Words of peace, but no treaty, are a sign of plot.""""Never move except for gain. Never deploy except for victory. Never fight except in a crisis."""

All of the segments can be used as metaphors for running, not only others more efficiently, but also yourself. The title is quite deceiving as well, as Sun Tzu takes the stance that war should be the last resort of diplomacy."

If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle."" This quote in particular struck me as sound advice for not only battle, but daily life as well. Despite a thousand or so years passing, most of the tips Sun Tzu gives are still solid battle strategy. That's what makes ""The Art of War"" so good. It's still relevant today."
"877",876,"Mrbeaujangles23","This was not the translation I actually read, but I could not find the one I did -- from Shambala Press. I have read this book probably 13 or 14 times -- by far the most times I have ever revisited a book -- with the exception of perhaps Calvin and Hobbes comic strips. At one time, I was making a point to read it once a month. Basically, it is ancient Chinese strategy for how to conduct warfare -- but the true message of the book, I believe, is in seeking a way to peace. There are volumes of wisdom here -- and in many ways it is perhaps my all time favorite book. While it is largely a manual written for generals of armies long ago, its lessons have parallels in all facets of our day to day life: to our interactions with others, to business, to negotiations, to politics, to poker (especially!). Just writing this all down makes me want to read it again. I will never be without this book close at hand. "
"882",881,"Martti","Sodankäynnin taito on kirjoitettu Kiinassa noin 2500 vuotta sitten, se on siis Raamattuakin vanhempi teksti. Kun teos on kestänyt näin kauan ajan hammasta ja sitä luetaan vieläkin ahkerasti, kyseessä täytyy olla poikkeuksellisen hyvä kirja. Niin se onkin. En osaa edes kuvitella, millaista elämä oli 2500 vuotta sitten, mutta teoksen kokonaisvaltainen ajattelu sodankäynnistä, strategisesta ajattelusta ja ihmisten johtamisesta jaksaa hämmästyttää ajankohtaisuudellaan. Sun Tzun teksti on yksinkertaista, selkeää ja samalla filosofisen syvällistä. Kenraaleille johtajina asetetaan kovat vaatimukset. Heiltä edellytetään mm. viisautta, tyyneyttä, puolueettomuutta ja itsehillintää. Heidän tulee kohdella alaisiaan hyvin, kuin omia lapsiaan. Sun Tzun mukaan ihmisten käyttämisessä on oikea menetelmä käyttää sekä ahneita että typeriä, viisaita ja rohkeita, ja antaa kullekin vastuu tilanteessa, joka sopii hänelle. Ihmisiltä ei saa vaatia sellaista, mihin he eivät kykene.Kirjan kokonaisvaltaista ajattelua kuvaa, että sotataidon huippuna on vihollisen kukistaminen ilman taistelua. Ensisijaisen tärkeää sodassa on hyökätä vihollisen strategiaa vastaan. Huonoin toimintalinja on hyökätä kaupunkeja vastaan. Sodankäynnin taidossa korostetaan toimintojen nopeutta ja oikea-aikaisuutta, vihollisen harhaanjohtamista ja yllättämistä.Sun Tzun mestarilliseen ajatteluun kannattaa tutustua siitä riippumata, kiinnostaako sodankäynti vai ei."

You, as the reader, will be able to obtain a great knowledge of Sun Tzu's principles in an easy to read, list-style format.This is a book that I would recommend to anyone. I would especially recommend this book to any individual who is in the process of embarking on a new journey in their life such as attending a different school, beginning a new job, or entering any other kind of network in today's world.

"918",917,"Kang","This is one of two editions of Sun Tze's classic that I own; the other is a bilingual edition published by a Hong Kong publishing house which I vastly prefer over the BN edition. Neither translation, however, is adequate. For example, in the first verse, both translators translate ""guo"" as ""state,"" when it should be more properly translated as ""country."" No one says, ""I will die for my state,"" but people do say, ""I will die for my country"" (wei guo er si). Or again, in the famous or infamous 6th verse or chapter, Sun Tze employs a phrase which the two translations render as, deception is the basis or basic quality of war. But Sun Tze employs a three word phrase, the middle character of which is ""dao"" (or ""tao"", as in ""Taoism""), so that a more literate translation that gives a better feel for the original would have to say that deception is the ""way"" of war, where ""way"" (""dao"") is allowed to carry with it the moral and indeed cosmic resonances it would have for a Chinese reader. Sun Tze's use of ""dao"" anticipates, some 2000 years before the fact, Machiavelli's use of ""virtu."" Hence I prefer an edition with the original Chinese. The Barnes and Noble edition suffers the further defect that Sun Tze's original divisions into 100 verses/chapter have been butchered and disregarded. In short: a classic and immortal text, a shoddy edition."

The book contains philosphical techniques and military tactics that we can use in our everyday lives or when we're facing something challenging at school or work. It gets right to the point without boring the reader with long introductions. I disagreed with some points but agreed with more. I myself couldn't stop underlining every sentence. It should definetly be on everyone's to-read list."
"931",930,"Robert Palmer","This is one of the great classics of military thinking. It is one of many books I read during the time that I served as an officer in the U.S. Army. Indeed, I have read and own many different translations. The translation by Samuel B. Griffith was required reading for all officers when I was assigned to the First Cavalry Division.At first, western readers may have some difficulty understanding Sun Tzu because of his use of abstract metaphors. For example, he says, ""the potential of troops skilfully commanded in battle may be compared to that of round boulders which roll down from mountain heights."" His point is that the effort required to start such a boulder rolling down the mountain pales in comparison to the force it has when it gets to the bottom of the mountain. Thus, this roughly corresponds to at least two of the principles of war espoused by U.S. Army doctrine -- the principles of mass and economy of force.For those who want more depth, another very useful translation is the Gary Gagliardi translation (http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23...). In his introduction, Gagliardi explains that the ""formulaic nature of the original Chinese does not translate well into English."" For that reason, Gagliardi has the original Chinese words and a word-for-word translation on the left page and a modern English translation on the right page.Another version I have read is the translation by Ralph Sawyer (http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31...), whose extensive commentary is very helpful."

"954",953,"David Jedland","About a country going to war... If it is in winter it will be too cold ; if it is in summer it will be too hot. So it should be neither in winter nor in summer. If it is in spring it will take people away from sowing and planting; if it is in autumn it will take people away from reaping and harvesting. Should they be taken away in either of these seasons, innumerable people would die of hunger and cold, And, when the army sets out, the bamboo arrows, the feather flags, the house tents, the armour, the shields, the sword hilts -- innumerable quantities of these will break and rot and never come back. The spears, the lances, the swords, the poniards, the chariots, the carts -- innumerable quantities of these will break and rot and never come back. Then innumerable horses and oxen will start out fat and come back lean or will not return at all. And innumerable people will die because their food will be cut off and cannot be supplied on account of the great distances of the roads. And innumerable people will be sick and die of the constant danger and the irregularity of eating and drinking and the extremes of hunger and over-eating. Then, the army will be lost in large numbers or entirely; in either case the number will be innumerable. And this means the spirits will lose their worshippers, and the number of these will also be innumerable."

The student is able to adapt these principles to modern warfare and even now twenty-five centuries after its preparation one can adapt the fundamentals, which influence the way we can win by the decisions we make in a variety of situations and circumstances.

Very sly. If however you see yourself in opposition, arguing your point, try Sun Tzu first.For the rest of us the books are short and make interesting historical and somewhat philosophical reading but they aren't going to change your life other than giving you a leg up on the intellectual book ladder, always a plus for the pseuds!

It discusses tactics and strategies in military affairs, that are implicitly related and indirectly applied to the fields of business affairs, human psychology, management, ancient history, military sciences, politics, anatomy of organizations in conflicts, and the likes. Classics remain classics not because they were written in the ancient times; they were called classics because they continue to have meanings - different meanings when read in different circumstances and moods. They become more useful as we use them, therefore we grow wiser with them. Understanding Sun Tzu's treatise is understanding ancient methods of resolving conflicts, handling battles, and hailing to the great spiritual tradition of Taoism."

Yes under attack , as well as in the war , feeling to be heated and being beaten , threatened. Well , i thought , that s life and that' s my life at moment. I started to read the ART OF WAR , 1 page every day for elaborate an exit strategy : be capable to win my ex wife Sentences in the book as : The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop of a falcon which enables it to strike and destroy its victim Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline, simulated fear postulates courage; simulated weakness postulates strength. The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable. Therefore those sentences thought me a diffferent approach and point of view facing the divorce and consequently the life after divorce.

"1041",1040,"Sergio","Dünya'nın en önemli ve en temel eserlerinden biri yaklaşık 2600 yıl önce Çinli düşünür ve komutan Sun Tzu tarafından yazılmış. Hasan Ali Yücel Klasikler Dizisi sayesinde kitap ilk kez Çince'den Türkçe'ye çevrilmiş oldu. Daha önceki Türkçe kaynaklar İngilizce veya Fransızca çevirilerden Türkçe'ye çevrilmişti. Bu denli önemli bir eserin dilimize 2014 yılında çevrilmiş olması çok büyük bir eksiklik - zira, Çince'den Fransızca'ya çevirisi 1772 yılında yapılmış. Bu kitabın 18. yy'da Fransızlar ve İngilizler tarafından keşfedilmesi ve dikkate alınmış olması Osmanlı'nın çöküşünü hızlandırdığını söyleyebiliriz. (Bkz. İngiliz Ajanı Lawrence)Savaş Sanatı günümüzde sadece askerler tarafından değil, iş dünyası alanında da rağbet görmektedir. Kitabın bu kadar kısa olması ilk bakışta beni hayal kırıklığına uğratmıştı, fakat sonradan anladım ki bu eserin her bir cümlesi için 20 sayfalık düşünsel yazı ve açı yakalanabilir. Bence bu durumu şu sözlerle açıklayabiliriz: İnsanların yazı yazabilmesi için gerekli araçlar her geçen gün daha da gelişiyor. Daha az düşünüp, daha çok yazıyoruz. Piyasaya her sene kalitesiz kelime dizilerinden oluşturulmuş kitabın salınmasına şaşırmamalıyız. Yüzlerce yıl önce yazı yazabilmek bir servet demekti ve insanlar bir cümleyi yazmadan önce belki de günlerce düşünüyorlardı.

An emperor send him a group of females to see wat he can do, sun Tzu separate them into two different group an pick two specific leaders but the first time he choose the females were only fooling and giggling around so he slash their heads off in front of the other so they can see that he's really serious about them being a great warrior like himself . Sun Tzu choose secondly but this time the females see that he meant every word that already being said from his mouth so they all listen to him an do what ever he told them to do. This is not really a story it a book of strategy an tactics that he have done an said.In the book the way his strategies are setup if you follow them no way you can loose a war unless u didn't follow them right. Some of the laws he mention in the book are ""To know your enemy, you must become your enemy. To a surrounded enemy, you must leave a way out. Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer. You have to beleave in yourself. Avoid what is strong,and strike at what is weak. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.""

All fun and games aside, I think this should be required reading for all military officers as well as politicians who command military forces. "

"1071",1070,"Anum ","“Victory can be known. It cannot be made.” Sun Tzu’s “The Art of War” is one of the most rational works I have come across to date that deals with conflict management. Written more than 2500 years ago, the wisdom in its verses is still applicable today. Some may argue that, considering it was written for the military, it is only applicable in war, but I would consider them wrong. Conflict has become a part of our everyday existence. We disagree with our colleagues at work, with our peers at school and even with family members at home. However, to effectively manage conflict, one has to look at the bigger picture and bring all parties to view that bigger picture as well. To manage conflict by force of will is the key, not by the force of power. In order to have all parties agree on a matter, a compromise needs to be made, and that situation can only be gathered by observing the “Tao” or the way of things enfolding around us. One has to use the great force of the environment, physical and human to realize the bigger picture and take action in accordance with it. This is “Shih”. “Shih” is improvisation but not just improvisation. It is the key to everything. One has to note the “Tao” of things around him and then decide the best course of action that uses the force of the environment around. What’s more, timing is everything. An action taken too soon or too late will result in nothing but disaster. One has to be patient, gauge out the surroundings, decide the correct course of action and take it at the right time! The most intriguing aspect of the philosophy behind Sun Tzu’s work is the idea of victory without battle. Whether it is war or everyday conflict, fighting leads to nothing but a great expenditure of resources and entails nothing but disaster. It could be a legal battle in court or a heavy debate in the board room. It could even be an all-out war between two nations; however, the trick is to win over all parties involved and bring them to view things from your perspective. Only such an action could bring lasting victory and a true end to any battle. Lastly, the most important lesson Sun Tzu teaches us is to pick our battles. Every fight is not worth fighting and every battle not worth pursuing. The great wisdom lies in the idea that victory needs to be known before going into battle. One has to know how the fight will be won over before marching into the battlefield. If one knows that the fight is for a lost cause then one must NOT proceed. This shows us that if one is to put our resources into any task, one must know the true outcome one wants to achieve from it. One has to assess whether that outcome can be achieved or not, and proceed only if it can. Otherwise, it is not worth pursuing and will only lead to wastage of a sort that we cannot afford. This book will prove to be a treasure for all and its wisdom will prove immeasurable to anyone facing conflict in any aspect of their lives."

"1119",1118,"Big Dude","	Today, we're reviewing the legendary Art of War, a legendary book about military strategy by the general Sun Tzu. The book isn't really in a single genre, it's easily a part of plenty, such as Military Science, with the reason being that The Art of a War is a military tactic book. It doesn't have a main character, but the writing constantly seems to refer to the reader- so I guess you're the main character. It was written in 520 BCE in China, with the author being... Well, Sun Tzu of course. It's purpose is to serve as a guide about how to wage war, and the dos and dont's of warfare as well. It has 13 chapters, each dealing with multiple areas of war. Each chapter speaks of different parts of war, and notes what should be done, what shouldn't be done, and the correct and incorrect strategies of war. Surprisingly, the book isn't a mere celebration of war, it is instead filled with cautions and warnings about what happens if you do not follow Sun Tzu's principles. For example, being too hasty will annihilate you, while not discipline your soldiers makes them utterly useless, as they are equivalent to spoiled children. The book also notes war can only be declared when it's the only option, otherwise it is pointless. It must also be quick, because, as Sun Tzu said, ""There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare.""Do I recommend this book? To quote M. Bison from the Street Fighter movie: ""OF COURSE!"" This is a masterpiece of literature, and something that is surprising is the fact that The Art of War isn't being utilized solely by the military- businesses, sports teams, even lawyers use this book. Why? Many of the Art of War's strategies can be utilized in real life- granted, they aren't used violently by civilians. For example, Sun Tzu said, ""Do not press a desperate foe too hard."" This can be interpreted as, ""Don't keep pestering someone who is upset,"" which is a valuable life skill. Overall, the Art of War should be on your bucket list, and if it isn't, you're missing out big time."
"1120",1119,"Todd Baltz","Thoroughly enjoyed this book. Read it every year."
"1122",1121,"JuJu","The thing about this book that is so brilliant is the fact that all the tactics and lessons Sun Tzu discusses are applicable to any type of conflict that is imaginable, not just in war and battle. I'm not saying the book provides complete specific answers to any type of conflict, but it does provide ideas that make you think more logically about solving a conflict on hand. Some of the advice appeals to the psychological factors, some appeal to the physical factors. This is the reason why the book is useful in terms of serving as a starting read to give ideas and push for people to think about how they deal with their problems. Where it doesn't give a single instruction on what to do, it tells you factors you should consider, what factors you shouldn't consider and how your decisions will affect direction of the outcome. The even better thing is that he explains each strategy with common sense and simple terms that make it very easy for you to understand the main idea of something. By using common-sense and easy-to-apply lessons, Sun Tzu has written the ultimate strategy book to solve any conflict, of pretty much anything, serious or not, political or personal, personal or otherwise."

"1158",1157,"Terryn Nichols"," My book was the Art of War by Sūnzĭ bīngfǎ. I did not finish it but I will give you my best of what I read, as I read the Art of War. I learn that war is based upon strategy. You have to be at the place where your enemy will not see or suspect you to be at. “The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.” ― Sun Tzu, The Art of War. You need to try to outsmart your enemy with out killing your self. 	The art of war is importance to the state. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. It is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.” So begins The Art of War, the rules of war that was first published in China. Historians don’t know the exact date of the book’s publication in fact, they don’t even know who wrote it! The Art of War’s author was a Chinese military leader named Sun Tzu, or Sunzi. Today, Sun Tzu who wrote use the book as a compilation of generations of Chinese theories and teachings on military strategy. Whether or not Sun Tzu was a real person, it’s clear that “he” was very wise: The Art of War still resonates with readers today.	The point of the book was to help with war. By giving the best strategies known to man, and help with the teaching of winning the war, “If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.” ― Sun Tzu, The Art of War. That is the point of the story always know what your capable of doing and focus on doing the little things right. And everything else will fallen to place like it is supposed to. 	I loved the book so far, I’m try finishing it because it you can use everything in the book not just on war. But in everyday life, by learning strategies to pass the big test or even help with a football game. I like how the book gives really good detail about everything the author is talking about. It is incredible that the military use this book to help with combat.	I would recommend this book to my brother because he is a war person. And this teaches you how to be ready for war and teaches how to stay alive. He would like this book after he learns a little more about war and then reading this will most likely give him everything he will need to fight in combat."
"1160",1159,"Joel Jokinen","A cornerstone of leadership and strategy. Maintains the position of most unlikely book to be on its place on my book shelf - I like to come back to this book as often as possible; reflecting my current situation and means of life. Simplistic, intriguing, as eternal as a book can be."
"1167",1166,"Anthony Trevino","Classical and base knowledge of tactics and military discipline. Useful for the strategic mind to meditate on the root cause. Once the reader has a good answer for each fact stated in the book the mind should be able to think thoroughly through problem of business, and life."
"1168",1167,"Himanshu","You can say it as an epic for tactics and strategy making. A marvelous and must read for those who seek to be great leaders."
"1169",1168,"Masen Production","“""This is one of those books that one reads it every day to understand the nuances mentioned. Thomas Cleary translation is my favourite because he has not influenced the transcript in any manner. Thus Sun Tzu is a must read for everybody, everyday to help them develop a strategy towards life. "" ”"
"1170",1169,"Javier Contreras","The Art Of War. Sun Tzu was a Chinese general and strategist from the kingdom of Wu, in Eastern China. He was born on 544 BC and died on 496 BC. The book was originally written vertically on chopsticks about 1 inch think. It is said that he wrote the book while he was in exile after helping the ruler of Wu defeat against all odds the army of the kingdom of Chu. As well as conquer their capital. It is very hard to depict the strengths of the book, because of the way it is written. There is also no way to know how much was lost with the translation (if any). What I can say for a fact is even though it didn't leave you with any kind of hunger to know what was coming next, I always felt like I was learning and feeding my mind, and I felt a sense of satisfaction after reading it. Never did I think that it was giving me useless information. I felt it accomplished this quite nicely. This proves that the book, is in fact, timeless. The only way I can summarize the book is to explain how it is composed. It is divided into 13 different sections, each depicting and including tips for that specific section. For example, in the section Maneuvering armies he says ""Where there are hills, keep on their sunny side, with them to your right rear"".Thousands of years after it was written it is still relevant, which is quite impressive to be honest. For example, one of his most famous quotes is ""Every battle is won before it is fought"", is still relevant, and not only in one field of knowledge, in many. It basically means to know what you are up against and scout properly, it applies many things besides war, sports, for example; you must correctly scout the opposing team to know their strengths and weaknesses. Know your own weaknesses and strengths as well. That way the battle is won before it is even fought. In the end, The Art of War is truly timeless and it still nourishes the mind. Useful for countless jobs and for life in general. Thousands of years after it's creation, Master Sun's most important teaching ""To win 100 battles is not the height of skill-to subdue the enemy without fighting is."" is still pertinent, and it always will be."
"1172",1171,"Lionkhan-sama","Personally, I was rather surprised at how small the actual Art of War treatise was.It, specifically, is not a very long text.However, I feel this book adds a fantastic extra layer of pages and understanding, taking into account the historical, cultural, philosophical, military differences that the reader might be faced with in respect to Chinese literature.This translation was fantastic, and easily comprehensible, and I very much appreciate the fact that this particular translation takes all the most recent architectural findings into account.This book has really opened my eyes to some of the fundamental differences between Eastern and Western thinking.I am eager to read more Oriental classic texts and expand my knowledge in completely new ways."

"1181",1180,"Ambar Yadav","It had been a long time since I'd read Sun Tzu. And though I remembered it as an excellent book, I didn't much remember the contents. And what a pity that was! Not only is it an intelligent book, it is also extremely practical. Sun Tzu accomplishes an enormous task under 200 pages; laying out the general and specific principles that govern war. Of course, the original text itself is a bit ambiguous in places (owing to corruption over the years and the intricacies of the Chinese language, coupled with Sun Tzu's colourful analogies and metaphors), but Sun Tzu successfully enumerated the principles that would lead a belligerent to victory, then and now. Lionel Giles' commentary and translations are a delight, offering other Chinese authorities' interpolations of the text, and allowing the reader excellent insights and modern day examples of Sun Tzu's principles being upheld in war, alongside snippets of wisdom straight from the likes of the Duke of Wellington and Stonewall Jackson"

"1204",1203,"Latie","A fascinating 2000 year old text that offers still relevant advice on leadership, foreward thinking, and cunning.One of the greatest lessons emphasized in this book is to avoid war at all cost, but to treat it as a necessary evil when no other option is available. Sun Tzu also advices to avoid unnecessary bloodshed, preserve captured cities; as they are worth more in working order then burnt ash. He also emphasizes that you use everything to your advantage, from terrain, battle formations, to your enemy’s weakness. For example: converting your enemy's spies to your side via bribery. Winning a war is not accomplished by strength and intellegance alone, but by remaining steps ahead of the enemy. In order to get ahead- one must be level headed, have the trust and respect of their subordinates, and most importantly- have knowledge (spies). Analyze the enemy so that you may interpret accurately what words may not convey but body language betrays. Knowledge is power and knowing your enemy as you know yourself guarantees victory. Overall a good read with a wealth of knowledge to offer (but no detailed tactics- mainly advice). Definitely recommend it."

"1209",1208,"Morgan Sohl","Interesting read. I like the logical and strategic process of his outline on how to crush your enemies. "
"1212",1211,"Tony Spicer","This classic of Chinese military philosophy has been used as a guide to military and business tacticians, alike. The ideas contained within the book are not reserved for military commanders and business executives. Rather, Sun Tzu's ideas are helpful to a person trying to buy a car, a house, ""this"" bushel of potatoes rather than ""that"" bushel of potatoes, walking through a questionable neighborhood, being victimized by inter-office politics, running for a local school board, or trying to convince one's significant other to take out the garbage. Taken as a ""method of living,"" it also goes a long way to helping one avoid the ""beige hell"" that often accompanies age and growing comfortable in our space. That is to say, Sun Tzu's philosophical side can help us shake up the nest and live a little.This edition of the book contains commentary by Ralph Sawyer, whose insights, explanation, and delineation of Sun Tzu's ideas is pretty enlightening; I don't always agree with him, but his tone suggests that everyone may not, and that he doesn't mind. The book contains The Art of War, but also Military Methods, by Sun Pin, a follower of Sun Tzu, whom the editor argues may have either been a contemporary, or that they may have been the same person. Either way, the texts work so well together that, to read Tzu, one must read Pin. The are both enlightening, and the edition is quite wonderful."

Once you really start to dig into it you realize that a lot of the thoughts and ideas are applicable to becoming a successful person in life. But caution should be taken before doing so because it is first and foremost a book of military strategy and making it to personally applicable can make you a hard, crass, deceitful person. Especially the chapter on espionage. Sun Tzu, from the writings and commentary in the book seemed to value life, discourage rashness and not to act on the whims of a bloodthirsty, vengeful or greedy ruler. This is good advice for any good general, as well as any half way decent human being."

Sun Tzu's genius is complemented by examples of battles throughout history that are specific to his lessons. The teachings of this book could spell success in life for those who use them correctly.The style of this book is mainly instructional. The lessons are divided up into sections that are in order in they way Sun Tzu felt the topics needed to be considered before a war. While the lessons were inteneded to be military tutorial, the wording allows for easy translation into infinite aspects of life. If any are hard to understand, this confusion is cleared up by the examples that use each tactic.To those who are in a position a of leadership, read this book.

"1258",1257,"Robert A. Binger","This was an incredibly interesting book. It's basically structured so that Sun Tzu presents an aspect of strategy, and then several strategists of that time give a broader explanation and sometimes use metaphors or stories to go into more detail.This book covers a wide variety of military strategies and things to take into account. Though written long ago, it's still possible to translate the things in this book to modern warfare. I would definitely recommend it if you're interested in the details of war and the wide array of strategies behind it, or if you were someone looking to become an officer in the military or you play tabletop games such as Warhammer or Heroscape."

"1263",1262,"Ehab Atalla","To those without a business background, this book may seem confusing. Sun Tzu's book is about military strategy. It is most suited for generals. But there is much in common between military strategy and business strategy. After all, business does possess many of the same characteristics as warfare (you battle competitors to gain customers/it's a zero sum game). Sun Tzu begins talking about the five heads that all generals (and business people) need to be familiar with:1. Moral Law2. Heaven3. Earth 4. Commander Skills5. Discipline and methodMoral law in warfare is about having soldiers loyal to state; it's about having soldiers who are willing to put themselves in harms way and die for your success. In business, this is the equivalent of having loyal, hardworking employees and business partners who are motivated to work their best for the good of the company. Heaven, in warfare is about keeping in mind the seasons (are you fighting in winter, spring, etc.) In business, this is the equivalent of understanding legislative, regulatory, economic, and technological trends that will affect your business. For example, will new technology make your business obsolete? Will a new law be passed by congress that proves unfavorable to your business?Earth in warfare is about understanding distances and terrains in battle. In business, it's about understanding your competition, suppliers, customers, etc. It's about understanding the landscape you are entering. Commander skill and discipline are self explanatory. Overall, this is a great book if you tie it to business principles. Much of what Sun Tzu discussed ties in directly to business. The only downside is that the book is not explicit. Sun Tzu uses many metaphors and military definitions that you must analyze through a business perspective. For example, will there be a new law passed by congress that will damage"

"1283",1282,"Doc","I consider this to be essential reading. For everyone. In business, the strategic concepts are easily translated. In personal life, it helps to understand and deal with conflict situations. Combined with A Book of Five Rings by Miyamoto Musashi and The Unfettered Mind by Takuan Soho, this is part of a set that I frequently give to people."
"1284",1283,"Benjamin Parry","""Sun Tzu said: The art of war is of vital importance to the state""It would not be unfair to say that the Art of War is generally considered to be a 'must-read' book recommended to philosophers, students, business leaders and politicians alike. It is certainly deserving of this high-esteem.In the Chinese philosophical canon there are two main branches. Both originated in China around the 5th century BC and have permeated the society, religion and politics every since. These two groups are Taoism and Confucianism. Although they share some core concepts, notably the idea of the Way, they are in many ways separate. This blog is actually named after a quote from the Tao Te Ching, the key philosophical work of Taoism and I have a great reverence for the philosophy as a guide as well as it's inherent spirit. The Art of War is a taoist work and this shines through both in it's style of telling as well as it's advice.""Let your rapidity be that of the wind, your compactness that of the forest.In raiding and plundering like fire, in immovability like a mountain.Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.""The book is unmistakably about how to defeat ones enemy's. Although there is some general life advice to be found, it is with this purpose in mind that the book was written and it is in pursuing victory over ones foes that the most benefit will be found in its reading.""In Battle, there are not more than two methods of attack--the direct and the indirect; yet these two in combination give rise to an endless series of maneuvers.""The direct and the indirect lead on to each other in turn. It is like moving in a circle--you never come to an end. Who can exhaust the possibilities of their combination?""There are a number of chapters that deal with more specific aspects of war such as: the use or misuse of geography and the economic costs of different activity's. However, the majority is much more general and can be applied to almost any field in which one has to engage in combat. Although there is much to be learned from Sun Tzu's I feel that there are two key takeaways that should be internalized by anyone engaged in conflict. The first is that:""The Art of War is the art of deception""The surest path to victory is through appearing as one is not and acting as one is not expected. Bait the enemy with traps, make your forces appear weak when they are strong, obscure your plans so that the opponent can have no knowledge of your actions before you take them. These and similar principles are the fundamentals of brining about victory. It is very telling that the last chapter of the book deals with spies and how to best learn about the moves of the enemy as Sun Tzu commands ""Be subtle! Be subtle! and use your spies for every kind of business"". Almost as important as learning everything you can about the enemy's movements is to feed him false information and make yourself opaque to the same tactics ""In war practice dissimulation and you will succeed"". By doing these things you will keep you adversary in a constant state of confusion and apprehension unable to prepare adequately for any move that you may make. Which leads to the second important point.""To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself. Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat, but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy. Hence the saying: One may know how to conquer without being able to do it.""Although the practices mentioned above will be the cause of your victory they are pointless if you cannot make sure that you will not first be defeated. And it is this step that is in fact the only thing that is fully in your control. While you may be able to fight better and use tactics to win a battle if the enemy is also skilled or has a force that is much larger then your own then you cannot be sure of victory. In all instances, however, you are able to guard against defeat and this is done through the five key aspects of battle:- Morals- Heaven- Earth- The Commander- Order and DisciplineSun Tzu deals with the problems of Heaven(luck) and Earth(physical circumstances) separately and I don't think they are as worth a further examination here. The other three however are what any leader must keep in mind at all times during warfare. Firstly, he should make sure that he and his soldiers(troops, employees, allies) are in accord with the moral nature of their purpose. In a word they must understand that they are 'fighting the good fight' with this on their side the army will be imbued with a super human strength and will sooner die then surrender. Secondly, good order and discipline must be maintained and is dependent on the organization and treatment of ones troops, it is through the proper giving of rewards and punishments that this should be achieved. The last, and most important aspect is the commander. You.There are many admonishments throughout the book that the good commander should heed, however I want here to reproduce the five faults that Sun Tzu considers the prime parties responsible for the failure of any leader, as it is mainly through avoiding these that you can ensure you do not fall prey to the enemy:1. Recklessness, which leads to destruction2. Cowardice, which leads to capture3. A Hasty Temper, which makes one provokable by insults4. Delicacy of Honor, which makes one sensitive to shame5. Over Solicitude For His Men, which exposes him to worry and troubleWithin these two categories: understanding the art of deception and the mastering of one's own force lie the seeds of victory. These are discussed in greater detail in the book itself and the Art of War is truly more complex and detailed then these two alone, however they are the core upon which all of the rest is built. I am not going to go into the other sections of the book partly as it is a very short read and you can finish it in a day or two if you are really interested. However, I will here put down the most standout quotes to give an indication of the magnitude of the work:""supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting""""So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and attack what is weak""""It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war that can thoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying it on."" If you are facing an opponent in any field be it business, sport or anything else then this book will provide for you the perfect starting manual on how to defeat them."
"1287",1286,"Kelly","“If you know the enemy and know yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt; if you know Heaven and know Earth, you may make your victory complete.”Very compelling and powerful read. There is so much to be glean from these pages that can be applied in varying aspects of our lives. I definitely recommend this as a must read to all. "
"1288",1287,"Sidharth Vardhan","Now I'm ready to invade Poland...Okay, I understand that is not the kind of reaction Sun Tzu would have liked(best victories are won without fighting) but it makes a nice heading. His philosophy is simple - be good even if it means looking bad and to know your surroundings while you fight. He is against pretentious heroism, plunder or useless bloodshed whether that is blood of his own men or his opponents. Yet he wants you not to miss the opportunities where you can find them or to break the old moral laws where it is of advantage to you.Not that I'm looking to lead an army or pretend that I can but there is something so honest in there that you just love it. Perhaps it is book's realism (as against the bookish morality) - something comparable to Machiavelli's 'The Prince'. "

"1296",1295,"Hammy A!?","The Art of War is a military classic written by Sun Tzu in the warring states period of china's history. The book is filled with military and philosophical truths and strategies. The principals in the Art of War are still used in business and our armed forces today. It gives ways to engage an enemy but also to avoid him\ her. It is one of the first known written methods of warfare and is still the most popular book of its genre. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in a strategic field. People of all ages will enjoy this timeless classic. I thought this book was very interesting and a nice addition to my repertoire of knowledge. Generally translations of the book come with a lengthy and complicated introduction, so I would recommend having a reading buddy if you want to tackle that."

"1302",1301,"Yuval Hermelin","This is a very interesting book. It talks about how to defeat your opponent in battle and some battle tactics. I read the book because I thought it might help me with a video game I was playing. Also, I am really interested in war tactics. Sun Tzu's tactics were used around the world at his time, and were used to truly win battles. The specific version of the book I read had a little snipet here and there on how to apply Tzu's war strategies to businesses in the modern days. It was really interesting to see how they were interconnected. All in all, read the book. "
"1303",1302,"Amanda OH MY GOD IT Burns","Quite a while back I decided that there are certain books out there in this big wide world that I have to at least try to read before I die, a bucket list of books. I haven’t officially made a list on paper, it’s just a small part of my mind sectioned off to remind me when I come across one. This one here definitely fell on that list, and a few months back I happened upon it and knew it was time to check it off.My first snag was the fact the copy I picked up contained other books as well, so adding it to my reading shelf was a bit of a challenge. I quickly discovered that there are so many copies available with different add-ons that I finally just went with a selection that only contained this book without all the fluff. I swear it took me longer to sort this mess out then it did to actually read the damn book.On to my review or should I say thoughts:Initially I found myself thinking, “What the heck is the deal with this one? This book is total common sense.” Then it hit me, this book is ancient, most likely making the concepts it introduced revolutionary for their time. These concepts probably went on to affect the history between our times in ways my little pea-brain can’t even begin to comprehend. I use the terms “most likely” and “probably” because my knowledge in these matters is extremely limited. Taking the time to research it all does pique my interest, but honestly not at this time. So in the mind files it goes to be addressed at a later date.Do I necessarily have to enjoy the read? No. Do I just need to appreciate the book for what it is, a piece of history? Hell yes.…and that my friends, sums it all up."

I've read quite a few reviews for this book claiming ""The Art of War' is simply that - a book about war. And that it can't be used in a modern setting...to them I say:“Engage people with what they expect; it is what they are able to discern that confirms their projections.

This proves the practical and fundamental nature of this book, that otherwise can only be gained through painful experience. 3. Historians still debate if Sun Tzu was a man or a group of men, or if he even existed. Post-script: one of the most insightful chapters is the final chapter which addresses Espionage and how a general should use and protect against it. "

There are times I found myself agreeing saying 'OHH' and 'AHH', sometimes I am in deep thought because some of his words are profound. One factor why I am fascinated by this book is because like history.People may think that what he is saying in the book is already known like ""If your enemy is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him"" - It is indeed common sense but be reminded that during his time, this thought/idea may not be that common.

By doing this, this book also explained how the progression of war happened. This book was just a great book if you wanted to read about the tactics of war or for just entertainment purposes. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a book about tactics of war or just to read. I think anyone would like this book if they payed attention to it and read about it.

Es un tratado de psicología lo mismo que de antropología filosófica. En cada epígrafe de Sun Tzu hay una lectura oculta, una significación soterrada que generaliza sus planteamiento y los universaliza del terreno bélico al de la acción humana en su globalidad. Incluso si se diera, por hipótesis, la ausencia de esa lectura oculta, el libro ya sería del máximo interés para comprender la mentalidad militar de la época en la antigua China.

"1403",1402,"Victor Lam","The Art of War is a Chinese military treatise that was written during the 6th century BC by Sun Tzu. Composed of 13 chapters, each of which is devoted to one aspect of warfare, it has long been praised as the definitive work on military strategies and tactics of its time.The Art of War is one of the oldest books on military strategy in the world. It is the first and one of the most successful works on strategy and has had a huge influence on Eastern and Western military thinking, business tactics, and beyond. Sun Tzu was the first to recognize the importance of positioning in strategy and that position is affected both by objective conditions in the physical environment and the subjective opinions of competitive actors in that environment. He taught that strategy was not planning in the sense of working through a to-do list, but rather that it requires quick and appropriate responses to changing conditions. Planning works in a controlled environment, but in a competitive environment,"

"1416",1415,"Vania Melamed","This book is required reading to complete certain MCIs. While I wouldn't call it an 'Art', Sun Tzu explains the ""science"" behind war, mentalities and strategy. I read this book along side two others: Machiavelli's The Prince, and the DoD's Command and Control. This book was also required reading during a course on the former Soviet Union, though I'm not sure why; Stalin certainly would NOT have been a fan of this book. This is a great tactical book for hippies, because it explains in great detail why war is so necessary, yet only a last resort. It should be a staple of all Humanities programmes. Sun Tzu doesn't wax about war with a throbbing poetic erection; he merely tells you how to conduct yourself honourably, swiftly, and thoroughly in situations where confrontation is unavoidable. Think of it as encased, with a sign reading,""In case of emergency, break glass"". Hopefully, however, in the event of a real confrontation you'll have time to read the book. "
"1417",1416,"Alpha","To be honest, I listened to this audio book for one major reason: it is praised for its views towards war. In short, I am not disappointed by what this audio book has presented for it makes absolute sense on many of the concepts of warfare described in this book. I also understand the history behind on why it is such a famous book for it pertains to the history of the book itself. Sun Tzu wrote this book back in ancient Oriental times when information was limited to travel on horseback or carriage and access to such information was limited by status of one's person. Many modern readers today may say they don't understand why this book is so popular and praised yet they're probably seeing everything on terms of how we live today.The first big thing I must bring up is easily the details of common sense in the book. War is all about deception and in any warfare, that is true. However, there is also conduct and rules on what must be done during war beyond the battlefield but also the economical and political. There is always more to war than just slashing swords and killing people. Nevertheless, the audio book does an excellent job describing exactly what Sun Tzu was trying to express in his Art of War.The extras are probably fodder to some but can be worth it to those who love history as a form of entertainment. On this audio book there are extra tracks that describe the history part of the making and writing and distribution of The Art of War. This also includes the history of how it has survived for so many years. I do like this and find it appealing for my intelligence but it is unnecessary if all you want to know is the actual study of war itself. All in all, a great read for those who can see every factor on why it is so good. I gave it a perfect score for what it was. True military has changed but the basic principles have not...and a las, it is the basic principles which have seemed to be forgotten in war today."

"1427",1426,"Jacob Barton","In the Art of War, Sun Tzu’s main goal is to portray the height of intelligence that comes from staying away from any sort of battle. He doesn't try to make someone weary of battle, but implies that if a person looks into the situation properly he or she will not have to physically fight, but use their mind to beat the other person. Sun Tzu also tells that each captain or general should always be ready for every possible circumstance. Each general should be able to view all signs of a battle, and also have the intelligence to follow the rules that he sets forth in his book. Much about this novel is true and very applicable to life. When reading this book, one will see that the rules Sun Tzu lays out for battle are not only successful at war, but also when one tries to gain peace for the world. War itself is never peaceful and often the goal is to achieve a status of power, but Sun Tzu's novel shows us tactics on how to outsmart the opponent without enforcing violence. Leaders that create a sense of fear into their enemies eyes are not admirable. They are damaging to the peace and should not be leaders of their countries. Anyone who is interested in managing a group of people should read this book. It gives great insight on a peaceful way to take control and thrive. It has taught me ways to cope with different situations in life. -Jacob "

Traditional strategists exploited the enemies' weaknesses as a means to victory- an important, but incomplete focus. Sun Tzu builds on this idea by teaching how the wise leader begins their conquest by first mastering themselves, their emotions and acknowledging warfare as a struggle against both foreign and internal opposition. Applicable even today for the average person, uses can be found in the mini-battles of jobs, school, relationships, etc. Intentional or not, Sun Tzu's work transcends its original purpose and is an excellent read for all aspiring warlords.

To this day The Art of War is being used around the world not just on a military standpoint. It stands as a handbook for successful entrepreneurs, competitive businesses, athletes aswell as a required reading for several military squadrons. The art of war teaches that no victory comes from fighting a battle when not knowing and respecting both yourself and your enemy.

"1505",1504,"Rachald","The Art of War by Sun Tzu was a collection of 13 “chapters” on how a militia should be run, including strategies and tactics, in ancient China (circa. Ch’i state) Sun Tzu recorded the way that a militia should be run and perceived for his time period, along with the five governing factors of war: The Moral Law, Heaven, Earth, the Commander, and lastly method and discipline. Each a specific role in the way the Imperial militia was run along with all militia/soldiers in China. Though none of the information was fully one-sided or bias it shows subtle hints of influence directly from Sun Tzu himself that he gathered from his own experiences, and those he determined that worked best in all scenarios. The “chapters” of Sun Tzu were, for their time, considered a complete recollection of all things pertaining to war and war efforts. Although now it could be argued that the ideals of war tactics have changed and updated, if you will, to modern era. Even though we see some of the same ideas from Tzu’s complete chapters implemented into our own war efforts today.  Tzu was known for being a well-organized man on and off the battle field, thus is expected from a war general of the Imperial Court of Emperor Ho Lu of Wu. Seeing the same tactics and grouping in his writings would be accepted, as was shown through the “chapters” of his experiences. His arguments are sound, not only verbally but tangibly when he put his methods to action with his own soldiers and even women to prove that the methods of warfare were universal. The writing style is very formal and, for lack of better terms, frigid. Giving it the well written standpoint of a man who has been educated and lived, most likely, in the upper class of his time. Though it is expected to have more of a vivid depiction of his encounters instead of the frosted tone given to the writings of a man who lived on the battle field, none the less the writings were incredible insightful and well thought out.  Many others have opinions as to how war should be approached, therefore it could be assumed that many could have written valid and impressive arguments to a well-written piece but such is the endless opinion of man. Thus it could be said by many, that it may have been better off that a number of persons had written the approach to warfare of the course of our ever evolving history and change in society and ideas. The most striking part of these recollections would, in a biased opinion, be ‘The Use of Spies’. This is a detailed chapter of how using the men of a particular regiment, and installing them across enemy lines, can be extremely beneficial in gaining access to information that otherwise would have been lost to you, and more than likely, be the downfall for the surprised platoon on the battlefield. Resulting in a resounding defeat. "

Ketika belajar teori strategi memakai strategi Sun Tzu, saya sebenarnya agak bingung karena menurut Sun Tzu, Kemenangan dalam perang dapat diraih tanpa perang. Jadi Sun Tzu menyarankan agar perang sebagai ""alat"" terakhir untuk mengalahkan musuh. Sun Tzu menjunjung tinggi sekali ""wisdom"", makanya Sun Tzu tidak mau ada orang lain menjadi korban pwrang. Makanya Sun Tzu menciptakan beberapa keyword perang, yaitu deception, intellegence, the commander, dan context of war. Yang intinya, semua cara tersebut dilakukan agar perang sesungguhnya (bunuh-bunuhan) tidak terjadi.Sun Tzu berpendapat, perang akan menang jika memiliki jenderal yang cakap. Makanya salah satu tumpuan teori strategi perang Sun Tzu adalah pada seorang jenderal. Itulah beberapa poin yang saya dapat dari mata kuliah jurusan Hubungan Internasional saya.

"1558",1557,"Keith Bolden","	The Art of War by Sun Tzu is a military science novel about all the tactics, regulations, and the art of war. This book is broken down into 13 different sections of war that’s all interconnected with each other, giving a general a guideline to lead by. This book gets into the specifics of each part of war, with every potential outcome and how to react to this outcome. The Art of War goes far beyond just war. It touches on economics and business along with the ability to relate the material to many different things in everyday life. 	There are many things I like about this book. One thing I like about this book is that it’s concrete and straightforward. This book covers almost all bases of war with each rule that’s numbered through every section. It goes into extreme detail, even at times explaining every possible outcome of using fire in warfare and how to precede after. Another thing I enjoyed about this book was that it forces the reader to think critically. This book being only 126 pages caused me to think more than reading a 500 page book by far. I had to dig deeper with every statement made by Sun Tzu and left me in awe when he said things like, you can only be defeated if you allow yourself to be defeated. This book allowed me to apply these principals and rules to everyday life along with other professions. There weren’t many things I didn’t enjoy about this book but one of these things were that at times the book became repetitive. As I read further into the book I notice things that were previously stated already made an unwelcomed return. I understand that everything is supposed to be connected but when I read something that have been stated it causes me to question the intellectual value of the book. Another thing I disliked was that at times the rules lacked clarity. It seemed that some statements weren’t modernized or were still stated like it was from thousands of years ago.	Despite of being repetitive or unclear at times, I would highly recommend The Art of War. The great detail made this book well rounded, causing it to be very beneficial. Since it was so beneficial I had to keep reading, attempting to become a well-rounded individual like the book. Anyone interested in the military or just learning would love this book. This book is influential for many people and will continue to influence people for the rest of time. This is a timeless classic and a must read for any human being."

The Art of War is a short yet incredible book written in 5th century BC. Its age does not make its content irrelevant, as the interpretation of the book can be abstracted from specifics about military war to conflict in general, everyday life. The premise of the book is to rather ""subdue the enemy without fighting"", but if you must fight, you need to ""know the enemy and know yourself"" and develop strategies in order to secure victory.

The basic premise of the points can be applied to business and all forms of relationships. To know one person, their habits, can teach you about their thoughts, their desires and their goals. From an observation standpoint, you can learn how to work with people, how to listen to people and how to properly lead people, as well as yourself.I recommend this book to everyone.

Vencer sem combater, esperar o inesperado, conhecermo-nos a nós e aos outros são algumas das ideias que Sun Tzu explora, entre tantas outras de valor, que mais do que representarem formas de vencer uma guerra, são pressupostos que podemos aplicar no nosso quotidiano sempre que enfrentamos problemas ou obstáculos.

"1643",1642,"Coolchips101"," This is the most interesting history book I have ever read. In this edition, it tells about the Art of War, in great detail, and the man that wrote it. Sun Tzu was conciderd a mighty warrior and a great philosipher. What made him famous though was the book he wrote over two thousand years ago. The Art of War is the most famous ancient chinese work that is used today. The Art of War is useful in both life and war. It's useful in any competition, whether it be warfare, politics, business, and sports. The book was written as a result of Sun Tzu taking command of an ancient chinese army in 500 B.C. The original Art of War was written on thirteen vertical bambu strips, each about a foot long, consisting of just as many chapters. Every chapter in the Art of War pertains to every principle of warfare.  This particular edition is translated by Ralph D. Sawyer. My personal favorit parts of the book would have to be the fisrt few chapters. Reason being they tell of the main ponits of what the Art of War is all about and they seem to be the most useful. My absolute favorit quot that Sun Tzu emphisizes is ""Know your enamy and know yourself, and in 100 battles you will never be in peril."""
"1645",1644,"Amaha","Required reading for anyone who wants to study strategy- not just in the military but in the civic/political arena. If there are any other social justice campaigners out there who would like to discuss lessons learned and applicability of this book to our work, I'm down."

The simplicity and clarity of thought changed the way I approached things in my own life. The message, ""Slow down. Think. Access. Determine. Then, when certain, attack"" and the other ""Know when to cut your losses"" were new concepts for me. Thankfully, in the world of chaos I lived in as a child, I was able to apply these things as I made my way into adulthood. I still go back and read Sun Tzu from time to time. Not necessarily from cover to cover, but I open it and read a portion. It reminds me of how important it is to think before I act and for that, I am eternally grateful to a man and an ancient Chinese philosophy on war that can to this moment be applied to my every day my own life."

If I was in any army, at any time, I'd say would be a great way to educate command officers. I noticed Sun Tzu was mentioned in the only TV show I watch, so it has withstood the test of time. "

"1718",1717,"John Wiswell","The Art of War is one of the great classics of any language, and this is an admirable translation that I've enjoyed revisitng dozens of times since I first read it. It gives you a sense of the cutting edge of war centuries ago, cuts to basic human motivations. Further, Sun Tzu's advice can mostly be reapplied to the combative aspects of business meetings, arguments and conversations that we have every day. Supply, morale, high ground - it's all been re-adapted for use in virtually every profession. Personally, I find his academic thought process calming, and will often return to this book when I need to escape irrational anger or fear. Even after all these centuries, Sun Tzu can put a person in the mental place where they can work in a few dozen pages."
"1719",1718,"Ricardo Chévere","A strategy book based on the old Chinese concept of ""war"". The reader learns how to become the general of the forces of his life. Great for martial artists, but it could also be considered a self-help book. Don't be misguided by its name; war is not simply the angered, thoughtless and violent engagement of two oposing forces, but the calculated, well-thought, balanced and intelligent avoidance of violence to achieve victory when resolving matters of great importance."

É uma leitura bem técnica com interpretações que ajudam a dar leveza, a carregada frieza e inúmeros conflitos daquele tempo."
"1725",1724,"Cindy","Glad I gave this another try! The free Kindle download was impossible - Sun Tzu's actual text all mixed up with endlessly boring commentary. But the book itself kept all the commentary in the back, where it belonged. So much great stuff in here. As I read it, it really brought together all the history books I've read on the Civil War, the Revolutionary War, etc, and made sense of it all. I can see why this is still required reading in military academies across the globe. Brilliant stuff. And as my husband pointed out, it really does apply in business settings as well, anywhere good leadership is important."

"1749",1748,"5 Rein N","Sun Tzu, the author of ""The Art of War"", writes about many strategies used by the ancient Chinese military. This book is translated in most languages and is recommended reading for members of the armed forces. Many concepts in ""The Art of War"" are applicable today, and not just for military use. Many use the philosophies illustrated in ""The Art of War"" in daily life as well as business. One such principle is proper planning. This can be used in school, work, and in daily life. Sun Tzu lays out proper planning by saying ""Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking to determine the military conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison, in this wise."" when talking about military affairs. Sun Tzu also highlights the importance of tactical dispositions by saying "" To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself."" which can be interpreted to suit daily life. This quote especially pertains to the cutthroat business world where one must almost play a game of chess to traverse it successfully. "

"1795",1794,"Oscar","The Art of war is a book that illustrates military tactics, the book was written in BC so you can imagine the amount of age it has on it. The most amazing thing about it is how it has been used countless times by many military leaders. One famous quote that s also featured quiet a lot in history is ""Appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak"" , this tactic has been used countless times and has always worked, this shows that the book is obvious very popular for its correctness.The book has many inspiring features the great thing about it is how the battle tactics used here can also be applied in the business world as well etc. An example being “If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself,you will succumb in every battle” this can be applied in the working world because if you know what you opposition is aiming to achieve and you know what you have and want to achieve you can over come them and defeat them to that goal.This book is recommended to anyone that wants to learn about ancient warfare styles or even what type of tactics work in the current world."

"1811",1810,"Rhiannon","Love this book."
"1813",1812,"Mic","This translation is easier to understand than my Samuel B. Griffith 1963 translation. The book is divided into 3 parts: Sun Tzu's The Art of War; 3 detailed discussions, including Taking Whole (my favorite), The Sage Commander and Joining the Tradition; and commentary on The Art of War by scholars (including other generals) of Sun Tzu's time and later. Recommend that you read The Art of War once and then read the 3 discussions before reading it again. It helps make sense of concepts like shih, nodes and Tao that are difficult for Westerners (like me) to understand. It's not necessary to read the commentary, which is not helpful for the most part.Situations that continually shift and change from day to day are the ideal context for applying the principles of Sun Tzu. Read Sun Tzu patiently and thoroughly to help solve problems involving other people, in such situations. Even so, understanding it well enough to apply it comes only with perseverance and patience. You'll have to work at it, but the benefits are tangible. You've probably read Moltke's saying, ""No campaign plan survives first contact with the enemy,"" which was influenced by Clausewitz. I compare Moltke's saying to project plans within modern government or business settings. Sun Tzu will help you see, anticipate and deal with all of the setbacks and so on that arise in the face of any such project.Whatever has attracted you to Sun Tzu's The Art of War, you crave both a deeper and a broader understanding of the often hidden meanings in this little book. No doubt, you want to know how these passages apply to the daily and lifelong challenges in the wide world about you. The Denma Translation provides a thorough discussion, in Taking Whole, of shih and node (as in drawing the bow and releasing the arrow) as well as Tao. In The Sage Commander, you can begin to learn the personal traits you must develop to apply Sun Tzu's principles. You already realize that you'll be studying Sun Tzu for the rest of your life. You'll come back to this little book again and again on that journey."
"1814",1813,"Amro Ali","An Eye opener, ancient wisdom applied to modern circumstances."
"1815",1814,"Jason Marciak","There is little work on warfare and conflict so pivotal as the collected treatise of Sun Tzu. What you will find is this book are battle tactics, the mentality of a king. And yet there is a powerful reverence for life and a set of guidelines for a leader to rule any country well. A must read for any person who fights for a goal. "
"1816",1815,"Narek Grigoryan","Have you ever read a book which was written more than 2000 years ago? I have. “The Art of War” is a 2500 year-old book written by Sun Tzu, a famous Chinese general and a great philosopher. He is one of the best warlords ever, his philosophical texts are well known all over the world. Many other commanders used Sun Tzu’s philosophy to succeed in battles. “The Art of War” has a unique structure. It does not have any plot and there are no characters. The book is composed of 13 chapters. There is not any coherence between these chapters, each one is a separate statement. The main concept of Sun Tzu’s philosophy is that it’s better not to fight than to be involved in a conflict, but if you are going to have to fight, then you have to do it to win. Sun Tzu mentions various strategies, often brutal, that will bring you to that result. In the chapters Sun Tzu shows us the strategies to succeed, and the fruition of these strategies is just the art of war. The book is a bunch of tips. And by following those tips you can reach success in any realm. I can prove it by bringing some examples. “The Art of War” is listed on the Marine Corps Professional Reading Program. It is recommended reading for all United States Military Intelligence personnel and is required reading for all CIA officers. Many Japanese companies make the book required reading for their key executives. The book is also popular among Western business management, who have turned to it for inspiration and advice on how to succeed in competitive business situations. One of the main values of the book is its quotes. Each line of the book is a separate quote full of deep philosophy. And some of them are very illustrious, for example, “The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.” My favorite quote is “Even the finest sword plunged into salt water will eventually rust.”. I think “The Art of War” is a “must read” book for every person, especially for the future businessmen. Maybe you can’t find a book that’s expressing its ideas and whole philosophy of the writer as “The Art of War”."

I think that the things in this book could help someone mentally prepare for some sort of competition particularly in some sort of sport.I think the authors purpose in writing this novel was to educate people about the strategies of war. I say this because throughout the book it constantly gives accounts of how the strategies and different ideas were demonstrated in many battle situations. This book is basically a manual for war. It talks about all the different strategies and tactics and everything essential to a military. It goes on to talk about how to go about certain thing like maneuvering one forces to how soldiers should be treated. Overall I liked the book and i recommend it. "

Written in China(or what was in the process of becoming China) over 2000 years ago,it is one of the few books that not only hasn't lost it's relevance over the ages it has in my opinion only gained. Sadly, it gets overlooked by many people because they hear about itand they think,""I'm not in the military and never plan to be so what use is it to me?"" Yes,primarily it's purpose is to teach how to fight and win military conflicts,but it goes much,much deeper than that. If you desire accomplishment in any field: business,sports,politics,you name it,then this book can help you in some way to attain your goal."
"1890",1889,"Ford Waters","This book, although written in snippets of knowledge, more like a series of quotes than an essay or a book, is extremely beneficial in so many ways. Although the language and references are a bit outdated, the theories and observations still apply. And even though, this book is soundly used for military use, it applies itself readily to any situation and can be used as a wonderful self-help book; not because it gives affirmation to your existence or it makes you feel all fuzzy inside or tells you that all your dreams will come true, it's a self-help book because it draws metaphors for all facets of existence and gives logical and concise strategies for overcoming obstacles."

Everyone can win, from time to time, if they fight hard. To win without moving a single feather is the true victory. The most respected general does not wage war to win: he has won before it even began."

The book can be useful in any profession, in our everyday life, or even for games/video games. Being a chess player, I use it to improve my strategies and tactics — and the result is satisfying.Overall, The Art of War is one of those books that should read at least once, even out of curiosity.

I read this in one sitting, since it's relatively short, with and/or without the commentary. I read without commentary first, then followed up with commentary. These guys seriously played to win.

"1987",1986,"Tamcamry","I remember that I read The Art of War a long time ago, and I realize now that there really was a lot I didn’t understand. First off, many people will tell you that this book is good to read for business, and in some respects it is, but if you try to put all of the lessons in this book about war in effect in business, then you’ll be out on your ear in short order. This book does however give you a good idea of the things needed to do in any conflict. Know yourself and know your enemy, if possible use deceit and subterfuge as opposed to open conflict. These are very wise things to do. Moreover, these lessons will help you in business quite a bit. It also teaches that in whatever your field of battle may be, if you truly want to succeed, unfortunately, things like loyalty, trust, and honesty have very little place other than pawns in a morally bereft playing field. As in battle, in the fourth century B.C., these things are true in business today. Be very careful about who you ally yourself with, and always be ready to change sides. I would like to think that things are different now, but recent events show me that they are not. Many of these lessons I will put into effect."

As a child, I was drawn to the drawings but as I grew older, I realized that the words that came along with those works of art are more important.

"2023",2022,"Stefano Finazzo","""All warfare is based on deception""Sun Tzu montou um guia rápido para generais de como conduzir seus exércitos, provavelmente transcrevendo todos preceitos orais conhecidos à sua época numa forma conveniente para consulta e lembrança posterior.Com algumas máximas, seguidas de exemplos ilustrativos e práticos, ele mostra o que um general deve fazer e, principalmente, o que NÃO deve fazer, para ser bem sucedido numa guerra.O planejamento demorado, mas execução rápida. Conhecimento de suas forças e, em igual medida, das forças do inimigo. O uso das condições dos homens e da natureza a seu favor e contra o inimigo. O papel da imprevisibilidade nos olhos do oponentes. A necessidade de saber alterar seus planos face aos planos do inimigo. A vantagem de se evitar o embate direto quando desnecessário. São partes dos preceitos básicos de Sun Tzu.O que mais me espantou foi a sobriedade e a racionalidade dos preceitos. Sun Tzu parece nos dizer: ""Dado que você tem de sobrepujar seu oponente, siga meus conselhos para fazer isso da forma mais eficiente e menos devastadora possível"". Uma moral fria, calculista transparece nos preceitos; mas essa frieza deliberada é assim de forma a maximizar as chances de vitória e minimizar as perdas - um objetivo humano, em última instância. Friamente humano, mas humano. Eu acho, pelo menos"

""Those that excelled in warfare first made themselves unconquerable.""""The combat of the victorious is like the sudden release of a pent-up torrent down a thousand-fathom gorge.""""There are roads that are not followed.""""One committed to dying can be slain.

This time, however, I got a better understanding of the strategy, how war isn't waged on whim or reaction. It must be strategically engaged for victory. Sun-Tzu's work deals less with how to 'win a war,' than how to practice the intelligence and insight to understand the enemy, take advantage of the entire lay of the land, and then proceed with caution and, when necessary, with swiftness. No wonder this ancient book is still taught in our military academies."

"2084",2083,"Malquiviades","I have to admit that I have not read any other translation/edition from this classic. In any case, both this translated work and introductory essay from Mr Griffith are both superb. This is important, as a set of ""quotes"" it might be really hard to read without proper introduction, poor translation or poor foreknowledge on the subject. It is a 2500 years book, in Chinese, so pay attention to the translator.Also, the Annexes are quite interesting, too.My feeling is that this translation is quite closer to the original objectives and intention. It seems to me that Mr Griffith's military background is clearly put on the translation so to bring a new point of view beyond the usual translation from other renown sinologist. This is quite a nice feature, because it brings light to Sun Tzu verses that might be kept obscure otherwise. Also, it makes it more amiable.Probably this fact makes the difference between this and other editions/translations. Therefore, this 5 star goes for both the disputed Chinese author and the translator.As for the content itself, surely one can wonder how such simple compilation of common-sense can be regarded as a master work. To answer this, one should ask another question: how is that along 2500 years we have been and are suffering from misery, pain and distress due to ill-lead governments and wars of carnage. And how many more we should expect from the future...I think that many people miss the point that for Sun Tzu the war is a really bad thing to happen. It causes pain and misery to the people and may bring ruin to the state. It is a serious thing to consider, so the superb general is that who wins without actually fighting.It is not a 'militaristic' book. It is just common-sense applied to something nasty, but unavoidable: war."

"2087",2086,"Khalaf Alshammari","I remember when I first read it about 6 years ago, my first thought was that I had read this book way too late, and that I could've probably handled many personal and professional difficulties in a much better way had I come across it sooner in my life.The book is not just about war as an armed conflict. Most of its ideas and principles are applicable to daily life, relations and interactions with others. It provides an interesting and insightful perspective on life as a ""war"", as it really is in many ways."
"2089",2088,"Delicious Strawberry","I would like to preface this review by saying that I read the translation by Samuel Griffin, with a foreward by BH Liddell Hart. There are quite a few translations of this work, so I thought I should clarify. This is the only version I have read, so I can not compare it to other versions, but I did enjoy the foreword and additional notes, as well as the commentaries by other scholars.I will admit that if I read only the Art of War, without the commentaries, my understanding of some of the phrases would be a bit muddled as Sun Tzu was sometimes very brief in his ideas, so having additional commentaries and some examples helped to illuminate the text. I also took the time to read the additional biographies, and the effects of Sun Tzu's work on Japanese military thought, so I will say that the version I read was rather illuminating. Some people wouldn't care for the extra stuff, but I found it helpful as an expansion on the original text.And what of the original text itself? Sun Tzu was quite correct in many aspects, and his wisdom is practical not just on the battlefield, but in relationships and the business arena, so it's no wonder that this book is such a classic."
"2090",2089,"Scott Yates","ClassicI chose this book because it's one of the classic literary treasures in history. I like this book because it defines war and tactics well before the authors time. Not only is this a book on war, but it's tactics can be used in everyday life. I recommend this book to everyone."
"2093",2092,"Samuel ","All warfare may be based on deception, but all books on warfare, tactics and scheming are based on this. It's brilliant, has stood the test of time, having ""endorsements"" from men such as Napoleon, Mao and reportedly General Giap. The majority of reviews will say the same verdict as I have, its brilliant. This translation also has many bonus anecdotes about Chinese warfare's greatest blunders and triumphs. If you want to buy only one book on tactics and strategy, this is all you will ever need. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. "
"2096",2095,"Roy Love","Just brushing up on an old favorite."
"2098",2097,"Morris Graham","This ancient book of military strategy has been followed by military men and businessmen for thousands of years-two notable ones being Generals MacArthur and Patton. This work is attributed to Sun Tzu, a high ranking general in China about 5,000 years ago, though several other strategists are also quoted. Master Sun believed that war was a necessary evil, and must be avoided whenever possible. He felt like capturing an army or city intact was far better than destroying it. His book outlines 13 chapters of military strategy, covering everything from morale, use of spies, to position and timing. This is a classic work that will no doubt never lose it's relevance."

I ended up buying a copy for my Dad as well."

"2133",2132,"Someone Whom","My books is not this version, its the comic version by someone whom I've forgotten. It is an enjoyable read, and its interesting to see how this book was and can be immplemented in real life. However, it does have its shortcomings in how technology had advanced and some of these concepts are now obsolete, but this was written some 2,500 years ago, so I guess that is excusable. For example, archers can be changed into the normal infantry, and strategies can be adapted. This is surprisingly also able to be adapted to the business world, but I'm not sure how. Although I've seen several books on it. Overall, everyone should read this classic, except those who can't read and nubcakes."

"2164",2163,"Lilia Zuhara","To Sun Tzu, war is not about winning the pride, but winning with minimum damage. It is always being emphasized that you don't have, even you better not, to be considered as well-prepared team. You have to look as you don't know anything, but in fact you are the master of the whole war scenario. This is one point of Sun Tzu's ""Art of War"".There are plenty of strategies to be learned in this book. And fortunately, most of the theories could be used in real modern-life. After reading this book, you will realized that all of the war strategies inside was intended to avoid bigger conflict and put yourself in vantage point. By this point of view, I also realized that basic ground of the whole strategies is as same as economic theory. Maybe that's why a lot of business school using this book for lecturing material. "
"2167",2166,"Fady Safwat","one of my absolute favorite books, a guide to life and leadership in the modern times"
"2169",2168,"William Geerdes","The teachings of Sun Tzu have be handed down for thousands of years. Originally by word of mouth, his teachings have been collected into a treatise known as “The Art of War”. The treatise is a great manual for anyone looking to conquer and/or dominate their world. This is because it has been organized into thirteen different books (chapters), giving the reader the option to pick and choose what they want to learn about in their quest for domination. Because of this, it has been translated into several languages and has been used by politicians, businessmen, and CEOs throughout the world. 	I give this treatise a 5 out of 5 star rating as it is interesting and still relevant in today’s society, thousands of years after its printing. The superb ability of the treatise to remain relevant throughout time shows how well Sun Tzu’s logic and reasoning creates one of the best guides to controlling and dominating states. This is seen in the multiple versions and translations of the treatise throughout history that are still being printed today. The ability of the manual to transcend multiple facets of everyday life further solidifies its position as one of the best guides to controlling and dominating the world around you."

"2221",2220,"Jon Gabriel","Back 2500 years ago, when The Art Of War was written by Sun Tzu, a military commander, in China, he was part of the most advanced and prosperous societies on the face of the planet. Let me put this in perspective: when the British Isles were still overrun by barbarians, and when the Roman Empire was not even on the map (it was only a very small republic) was this work on military tactics being written. Let me also put this in perspective: that very work is still to this day on the United States military’s recommended reading list for officers, and was considered a bible by Douglas MacArthur and Napoleon Bonaparte. That is just how important Sun Tzu’s writing is, 2500 years later. It would just be nice if more people in charge of our militaries and countries today would read it too, for if they did, I would go as far as to bet that many of the largest conflicts and political disasters of the modern era would not have escalated to the extent that they so tragically did. “The wise warrior avoids the battle”. This line came as a surprise to me. It felt odd to find that the number one strategy presented was to avoid battle altogether. However, it later became clear to me that what Sun Tzu was trying to say, and what he wanted the message of his words to be was: avoid conflict at all costs, but conflict is an inevitable part of life, so when in conflict - fight to win. At first glance, and this was true at mine, I took this book to be a hardcore book on military tactics (which, to a certain extent, it is), and thought it to have no relevance outside the battlefield. However, and I am sure I can speak for all readers of The Art Of War, once completing this work, you realize and appreciate the significance of the cliché of life being a battlefield, for it truly is. The tactics detailed and presented throughout the course of The Art Of War can be applied to school, the office, the sports field, and many other aspects of daily life.Many critics of The Art Of War lambast the proponents by saying that the book really doesn't have a place outside of the minds of people who occupy positions of power, while others state that the lessons taught are nothing more than common sense. Lessons and tactics like: “Supreme excellence consists of breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting”, “So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong, and strike at what is weak”, and “Let our plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt” may seem a bit esoteric and non-applicable to daily life, and even obvious once you learn the meaning of them. However, I find this to be the true art of this work, which is to take an idea so complex, yet obvious at the same time, and give it context. Not just any context, but context that we can learn from. And, if we are to reserve this knowledge, these tactics to those who govern our lives, from parents to teachers, to top politicians, how are we meant to fight back? is that not the true art of war?Before finding a copy of this book, I highly recommend finding a translation or version of the book that fits your needs and desires. The Art Of War was translated from a series of scrolls found on the side of a mountain, so, as you can imagine, there are many different translations, some of which put large emphasis oh historical exposition and less on the actual original texts, and others vice versa. It may take time, but this preliminary effort will definitely make your reading experience much more enjoyable.Sun Tzu’s The Art Of War is that special kind of book that has just as much importance as id did 2500 years ago. That is what makes it a classic. It is full of life lessons for literally anybody who wants to know how to get more of what they want in life, and less of what they don’t, with the added perks of having a new armory of wise quotes, and the ability to examine all the enemies that life can throw at you through the mind of a seasoned commander. It is a very special book. Absorb and learn it. It will pay off in the long run, whether you think it will or not. “If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.” - Sun Tzu"

"2260",2259,"Quentin","Quentin Covert said: The Art of War is a blend of Chinese tactics as well as the tactics of it's writer's village, the home of Sun Tzu. This book gives an adaptable and genaric view of war and tactics, useable on both the ""battlefield and the meeting room"", to summarize it would take to long as each chapter is like an entire story, simply writen in two or three pages. So I shall sumarize the first chapter: Sun Tzu said: There are five aspects of tactics, Nature, Earth, The Commander, The Moral law, and the Ruler, from these aspects come many genaric questions such as ""Who's army is closer to the battle, who is stronger"" therefore all warfare is based on deception, making the enemy beleive he is at an advantange when he is truly the one to lose. This book is recomended for those who love the Chinese, and those who want to get an edge on mental warfare. 212 Pages"

The book was originally written in horizontal wooden planks. The book is wonderful, I learned a ton of information and how to apply the teachings to daily life, for example:""Know your enemy and know yourself and you can fight a hundred battles without disaster""-Sun TZUThis quote expresses that you have to be confident and trust yourself to overcome obstacles.Many professional athletes apply this teachings too.""The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting""-Sun TzuEvery time I read this quote I get inspired, this book is not only war, it says that fighting is always a loss and you loose supplies, words have a very powerful meaning too.Conclusion:This is a great book that everybody disserves to read and learn form a very wise person, it has a lot of lessons and inspirational quotes."
