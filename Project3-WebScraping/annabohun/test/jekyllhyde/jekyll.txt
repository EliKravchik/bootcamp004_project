OH BOY  OH BOY  PEOPLE I HAVE A NEW FAVOURITE This edition came with two stories   The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  and  The Bottle Imp   and they were both awesome let s talk about them  I m so excited I can t contain myself Jekyll   So  Well  Crafted  From beginning to end the story was engaging and the themes where quite straightforward  but I really love that in writing  see  George Orwell is my favourite author   I like it when authors aren t bogging their messages down in unneeded subtleties   Some of these sentences  I swear to god  One of my favourite ones   I slept after the prostration of the day  with a stringent and profound slumber which not even the nightmares that wrung me could avail to break   The context doesn t even matter  It s solid gold   My only distress with this story comes not from anything Stevenson did  but from the fact that it s so famous   spoiler alert    I wish I didn t know Jekyll and Hyde are the same person  Gosh darn it  The story is solid enough that it doesn t matter if you know or not   which is important  if one spoiler can ruin your story you don t have a very good story   but it would have been so wickedly fun not to know  Stevenson did such a good job of hiding it   The ideas of evil vs good in humans were great  And the idea that Jekyll didn t hate Hyde   GOSH DARNIT THIS WAS GREAT   That ending though  That ending  THAT ENDING  JESUS Bottle   I had no idea what the heck this was  which made it so much fun  What a story  Stevenson has an awesome imagination  To avoid spoilers I ll keep this brief   This story was so stressful  Oh man I felt legitimate anxiety  My heart  it was not happy  WHICH IS GREAT  It s amazing when a piece of writing can make you feel real dread   Why was it set in Hawaii  When talking to a friend  who is Scottish  and so is Stevenson  so I trust her on this subject  she explained to me that Stevenson was known for being a world traveller  so maybe he just wanted to explore something new  It was interesting  I d like to look more into the significance of the Hawaii setting   definitely something to do with being an island   I wanted this to end more sadly  Gosh it was so set up for a sad ending  and I was dreading dreading dreading that it would end badly but sometimes these things can t end well  I think  ultimately  the ending didn t feel too bad  It could have been done worse  I think the  saviour  situation that happened had legitimate merit  but still  I think this would have been better if it had ended horribly Go read this  seriously people   It came about that Edward Hyde was so much smaller  slighter  and younger than Henry Jekyll  Even as good shone upon the countenance of the one  evil was written broadly and plainly on the face of the other  Evil besides  which I must still believe to be the lethal side of man  had left on that body an imprint of deformity and decay  And yet when I looked upon that ugly idol in the glass  I was conscious of no repugnance rather of a leap of welcome  This too  was myself   Richard Mansfield was mostly known for his dual role depicted in this double exposure  The stage adaptation opened in London in 1887  a year after the publication of the novella   Picture 1895  Dr  Henry Jekyll is a brilliant man who in the course of trying to understand the human psyche has turned himself  with tragic results  into a guinea pig for his experiments  He has unleashed a power from within that is turning out to be too formidable to be properly contained  This book was released in 1886 and at first none of the bookshop wanted to carry the book because of the subject matter  but a positive review had people flocking to the stores to read this sinister tale of hubris overcoming reason   The American first edition is the true first edition because it preceded the London edition by three daysThe timing was perfect for releasing such a tale  The Victorian society was struggling with the morality that had been imposed upon them by the previous generation  They were embracing vice  Many men of means living in London now found themselves hearing the siren song of pleasures available on the East End  They could be as naughty as they wanted and safely leave their depravity on that side of town before they return to the respectable bosom of their family and careers  They were struggling with the dual natures of their existences  The thunder of the church and the faces of their sweet families made them feel guilty for their need to drink gin in decrepit pubs  smoke opiates in dens of inequity  consort with underage whores  and run the very real risk of being robbed by cutthroats  This walk on the wild side also allowed them the privilege of feeling completely superior to all those beings providing their means of entertainment  Jekyll as it turns out is no different  He relishes the adventures of his other persona even as he feels the mounting horror of losing control of this other self he calls Mr  Edward Hyde  Furthermore  his creation has no loyalty   My two natures had memory in common  but all other faculties were most unequally shared between them  Jekyll  who was composite  now with the most sensitive apprehensions  now with a greedy gusto  projected and shared in the pleasures and adventures of Hyde  but Hyde was indifferent to Jekyll  or but remembered him as the mountain bandit remembers the cavern in which he conceals himself from pursuit   Spencer Tracy plays Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde in 1941 Unfortunately indifference becomes more personal  more brutal in nature  as Hyde becomes more and more a caged animal who does not want to have to embrace the pretenses of Jekyll s respectable position   The hatred of Hyde for Jekyll was of a different order  His terror of the gallows drove him continually to commit temporary suicide  and return to his subordinate station of a part instead of a person  he loathed the necessity  he loathed the despondency into which Jekyll had fallen  and he resented the dislike which he was himself regarded  The tincture that has so far allowed Jekyll to contain Hyde is needing to be doubled and tripled to give Jekyll some modicum of control over his deviant nature  Jekyll contacts every apothecary he knows trying to find more of the solution he needs only to discover that the original batch that he used to make his  grand discovery  with must have been tainted with a foreign substance unknown to any of the suppliers  This foreign substance  unfortunately  is the ingredient that made the emergence and the restraint of Hyde possible  Dire circumstances indeed  Men who normally did not read novels were buying this book  I believe they were looking for some insight into their own nature maybe even some sympathy for their own urges  They made a book that quite possibly could have been thought of as an entertaining gothic novel into an international best seller  New generations of readers are still finding this book essential reading  Even those that have never read this book know the plot and certainly know the names of Jekyll and Hyde  It has inspired numerous movies  mini series  comic books  and plays  It could be argued that it is one of the most influential novels on the creative arts  It was but a dream  Robert Louis Stevenson was stymied for a new idea  He was racking his brain hoping for inspiration   He had his names for the agents of his dreams  his whimsical alter ego and writing self  Stevenson referred to these agents  it pains me to admit  as  the little people  and the  the Brownies   His hope was that they would supply him with marketable tales   RLSIt came to him in a nightmare that had him screaming loudly enough to wake the whole household  It was a gift from the depths of his mind  maybe an acknowledgement of his own dark thoughts  his own darkest desires He wrote the nightmare down on paper feverishly over ten days  When he read the final draft to his wife  Fanny  her reaction was not what he expected  She was cold to the tale  completely against publishing such a sensationalized piece of writing  They argued  thin skinned to any criticism as most writers are especially when it is a complete repudiation of a piece of writing he was particularly proud of  Stevenson  in a moment of rage  tossed the whole manuscript in the fireplace  Be still my heart  There is no arguing with success of this magnitude  but I can t help but wonder what was in that first draft  If there is a criticism of this novel it would be for the restrained nature in which it is presented  Did Stevenson just let it all go  Did he give us more elaborate details of Hyde s excursions  Was Jekyll s glee in Hyde s adventures more fully explored  I understand Stevenson was a fiery Scot given to flights of temper that could only be doused with something as dramatic as throwing 60 000 words into the fire  but how about flinging the pages about the room  and storming away followed by the proper slamming of a door to punctuate displeasure  In my mind s eye I can see his stepson  Lloyd Osborne  carefully gathering the pages  scaring himself reading them in the middle of the night  and keeping them for all posterity between the leaves of a writing journal  In 1920 John Barrymore played Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde Stevenson was obsessed with the concept of good and evil  We all have a side to our personality that we prefer to keep hidden  We all wear masks  For now our inner thoughts are still our own  but don t be surprised if the NSA has figured out how to tap in and tape those as well  Sometimes wearing the mask becomes arduous  Another entity fights to be allowed to roam free  We want to be impulsive  self gratifying  slutty  sometimes brutal  but most importantly unfettered by our reputations  I wouldn t necessarily call that evil  but there are people who do have true viciousness barely contained and we have to hope they continue to restrain it  The Victorians identified with Jekyll Hyde and maybe to know that others are also struggling with doing right without doing wrong certainly made them feel less like an aberration when they next felt the itch for the East End  I m sure this book was the source of many fine conversations as they drank their gin and smelled the musky hair of the doxie on their laps

Stevenson s wife Fanny Stevenson  and Joseph Dwight Strong  Isobel s husband The word that most of his friends and acquaintances used to describe Stevenson  RLS as I often think of him  was captivating  He was sorely missed when he made the decision to move to Samoa taking himself a long way from supportive friends and his fans  He was searching for a healthy environment that would restore his always ailing health  Unfortunately the new climate was found too late  he died at the age of 44 from a brain aneurysm leaving his last novel  the Weir of Hermiston  unfinished  Many believe that he was on the verge of writing his greatest novel  Oddly enough  F  Scott Fitzgerald a very different writer from RLS  but also a favorite of mine died at 44 as well  Critics also believe that The Last Tycoon would have been his best novel if he d had time to finish it  It does make me wonder about the wonderful stories that were left forever trapped in the now long silent pens of RLS and FSF  but they both left lasting monuments to literature  Even those that don t appreciate their writing the way I do still have to admit that their impact was undeniable  If you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews  visit http   www jeffreykeeten comI also have a Facebook blogger page at https   www facebook com JeffreyKeeten Robert Louis Stevenson was a man who knew how to play his audience  Utterson  the primary point of view character for this novel  is a classic Victorian gentleman  he is honest  noble and trustworthy  he is the last reputable acquaintance of down going men like Henry Jekyll  So  by having a character who evokes the classic feelings of Victorian realism narrate the abnormal encounterings  it gives it credibility  it gives it believability  thus  the story is scarier because if a man such as Utterson is seeing this strange case  then it must be real  Indeed  this gothic novella was considered very scary at the time  I think this was emphasised because Stevenson pushed the boundaries of the gothic genre  One of the tenants of the style rests upon the inclusion of a doppelganger  Instead of using this classic idea Stevenson transgressed it with having his doppelgangers relationship reside in the same character  Jekyll Hyde is the same person  and at the same time one and another s counterpart  I think this is a masterful technique because the relationship between the two is more psychologically complex and fear inducing  than  for example  the relationship between Frankenstein and his Monster  It breaks the boundaries of the normal role and establishes a doppelganger relationship that is stronger than any others  This all happened because one day a Victoria chemist decided to see if he could separate the two states of human nature  The result was a successful disaster  Utterson has to try and piece together the scraps of the strange situation  He is perplexed at the idea of the paranormal because logic dictates that this shouldn t be happening  therefore  it isn t real  but only it is so  again  it becomes more scary  The incident at the window is demonstrative of this  Utterson witnesses Jekyll s transgressive shift into Hyde and a shift between the doppelgangers  The blood of the Victorian gentleman is frozen by what he beholds   I learned to recognise the thorough and primitive duality of man  I saw that  of the two natures that contended in the field of my consciousness  even if I could rightly be said to be either  it was only because I was radically both  I love the gothic genre and I love this novella  I think so much can be taken from it because the number of interpretations that have been made of it are huge  It is told in my favourite style of narration  epistolary  There are a number of narrators  including Jekyll himself  Consequently  the interpretive value is increased significantly  I ve spoken a lot about Utterson  but there is also the strong possibility of Jekyll being an unreliable narrator as he has deluded himself almost completely  One could also compare the work to Stevenson s own life and his self imposed exile as he wrote this gothic master piece  In addition to this  Hyde can be seen as the personification of having the so called exact physical characteristics of a criminal in the Victorian age  and the homosexual undertones are also very implicit in the text  There is just so much going on in here  The literary value of this is  of course  incredibly high  But  it is also incredibly entertaining to read  I ve written essays about this novella for university  thus  I could praise this book all day and night  This is  certainly  the best novella I ve read to date  I had to buy a Folio Society edition of it  I just had to   After the overblown Frankenstein and the undercooked Dracula  it s pleasant to find that the language and pacing of the third great pillar of horror is so forceful and deliberate  especially since I was disappointed by Stevenson s other big work  Treasure Island   But then  this is a short story  and it s somewhat easier to carry off the shock  horror  and mystery over fewer pages instead of drawing it out like Shelley and Stoker into a grander moralizing tale But Stevenson still manages to get in quite a bit of complexity  even in the short space  As I was reading it  I found myself wishing I didn t already know the story  that it hadn t been automatically transmitted to me by society  because I wondered how much better it would be to go in not knowing the answer to the grand  central mystery  but instead being able to watch it unfold before me  Much has been said about the  dual nature of man   the good versus the evil sides  but what fascinated me about the book was that despite being drawn in such lines  it did not strike me as a tale of one side of man versus another  Indeed  it is the virtuous side who seeks out a way to become destructive  showing that his virtuosity is a mere sham Likewise  neither Jekyll nor Hyde seem to have any real motivation to be either  good  or  evil   it is more that they are victims of some disorder which compels them to be as they are  that causal Victorian psychology which  in the end  robs anyone involved of premeditation for what they do  Dracula kills to survive  Frankenstein does so because he is the product of the ultimate broken home and Hyde does it as a self destructive compulsion despite the fact that he loves life above all else  yet is unable to protect himself well enough to retain it This is not the evil of Milton s Satan  or of Moriarty  who know precisely what they do and do it because of the way they see the world before them  but that of the phrenologist  who measures a man s head with calipers and declares him evil based upon the values so garnered  independent of any understanding  motivation  or reason And yet this is not an unbelievable evil  indeed  Stevenson uses it as an analysis of addiction and other self destructive behaviors  where the pure chemical rush of the thing becomes its own cause  despite the fact that the addict will tell you he wishes nothing more than to be rid of it  to be normal again  never to have tasted the stuff in the first place  It is a place a man might fall into through ignorance and carelessness  never realizing how hard it could be  in the end  to escape And that s something we can all relate to  far more than the sociopathy of Moriarty  which requires that you have complete understanding but just a completely different set of emotional reactions to the world around you  It is much easier for most people to say that there is some part inside them that they do not like  that makes them uncomfortable  some thoughts and desires which rise unbidden from their brain  and which they must fight off  And it is the fact that they are strong enough to need to be fought off that unsettles us and gives us pause  for we do not like to think that such incomprehensible forces might always be there  working  just beneath the surface  and which might come out not due to some dark desire or motivation  but due to simple  thoughtless error   I have become a monster  I must find a place where I can hide  That s it  I shall call myself     DUN DUN DUUUUN     Mr  Where I can  The above is paraphrased from a  Morecambe   Wise  Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde sketch  they don t often make me laugh  but this one is gold Not so much  The Strange Case  as the  Overly Familiar Case   The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde is one of those stories that practically everybody knows so few people bother to read the original text  The original  Frankenstein and  Dracula are also often neglected by readers for the same reason  This is a shame because these are great books and well worth reading    Frankenstein is particularly beautifully written  Clearly the inspiration for  Dr  Banner and Mr  Hulk   The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde is  first and foremost  a damn fine horror story  If you ignore the fact that you already know all the plot points and just immerse yourself into Robert Louis Stevenson s wonderfully atmospheric setting and prose  Imagine walking around a foggy London street in Victorian times  whistling some spooky tune  and suddenly    DUN DUN DUUUUN       Mr  Hyde comes out of nowhere and whacks you on the head The theme of the duality of human nature is not exactly vague since it takes on a such a physical manifestation  However  Stevenson leaves you to draw your own conclusion of whether Jekyll s theory is valid  The story is also an allegory and a cautionary tale for inebriation  or getting wasted   and yielding to temptation in general   Just one more pint  and you may find yourself whacking people in foggy London Interestingly Dr  Jekyll is not as good a guy as many people may assume  The text clearly indicates that he is always up for a wild time  painting the town red  visiting houses of ill repute  and doing some serious S M   Besides  no decent gentleman is going to deliberately    and repeatedly    take drugs that turn him into a psychopath Anyway  do give The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde a read  it may be old hat  but it never goes out of fashion  Try it on for size Art by  MB CG  _________________  Not to be confused with M S which is Marks   Spencer  where you

chose the one read by David Barnes  as he sounds suitably English  The narration is a little bit of a monotone  but nice and clearly read  and it s free so I can t complain  Thank you Mr  Barnes  I m so glad that I decided to re read this book  because I enjoyed it so much more than the first time  And I have no idea why I didn t like it this much first time around  I guess I rushed through it to get to the end  And I just remember that I found some parts really boring to read  Well this time  not a single page was boring  I also really like how creepy the story was  and how well everything was explained in the end  This is that kind of a book that will make you think after you finish it  and those kind are my favorites Definitely changing this to 5 stars  and planning to re read it again some time in the future  hopefully soon   This book was the start of my on going love story with gothic fiction  Definitely one of my favorite classics in one of my favorite genres  I highly

wmthyr Gryb wmmt  This book has officially made its way to my favorite classics of all time list  I thoroughly enjoyed it  Let s discuss The characters  Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde were so well crafted  Jekyll represents the  good  side of the mind and Hyde is the  evil  one  They are complete opposites  appearance  behavior  social class   so you d think they would absolutely loath each other but then Stevenson throws this idea that Jekyll doesn t hate Hyde    Aghh that was GREAT  My issues  The twist of this story is actually pretty famous so I knew that  view spoiler  Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde were actually the same person   hide spoiler   but how I wish I didn t  If you can go into this story not knowing anything about it  that would make it ten times better  I feel like reflecting the ugliness inside Hyde by his physical appearance was kind of a cliche but it didn t bother me that much because it was relevent to the story  The Bottle Imp  This is a short story that was included at the end of my copy and I had absolutely no idea of what it was about before I started it  I loved it  From beginning to end the story was so engaging  you can t possibly put it down  If you haven t read this short story yet  I highly recommend it   Thanks to Jeffrey s recent DJ MH review series  which includes  Mary Reilly  and  Hyde  in addition to the original   I realized that I had not  in fact  ever become acquainted with  Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  as  Robert Louis Stevenson  wrote them  Actually  the closest I d come was seeing  Dr  Jekyll   Mrs  Hyde   a mid 90s movie adaptation that I cannot  in good conscience  recommend   at a friend s house in middle school    and  frankly  no case of two being one involving Sean Young could ever possibly top  Finkle and Einhorn   so that film was doomed from the start   I m glad I bothered  and not just because I m pretty sure I had been pulling a mental Frankenstein style name mix up  wherein I assumed the doctor was the more sinister half of the duo   The tale itself is more complex than a  man becomes monster   or binary morality tale  though I can see how excerpts could have been used for the likes of Reefer Madness   The philosophical substance of the story reminded me of one of my favorite passages from Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn s The Gulag Archipelago     If only there were evil people somewhere  insidiously committing evil deeds  and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them  But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being  And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart       It s short  and RLS  and a classic  So  really  you have no excuse for not giving the original a read ___________________________________________  If you were absent from class during the early 90s  and haven t seen   Ace Ventura  Pet Detective    you need to remedy that situation immediately   Relectura octubre 2015   Sin dudas  uno de mis libros favoritos  Me encanta la forma en que se trata el tema de la doble   o multiple   naturaleza del ser humano y de las cosas que pueden llegar a hacerse para mantener a flote el lado por el cual uno es aceptado en la sociedad  pero sin renunciar al que mas verguenza da      Pequena extension de la resena         no hay que excluir que el hombre  en ultimo analisis  pueda revelarse una mera asociacion de sujetos distintos  incongruentes e independientes   Si dos sujetos dan miedo  como en el libro  imaginen a varios    Relei por tercera vez esta historia y tuve ganas de escribir mas sobre ella  porque son de esas cosas maravillosas que uno quiere comentar  al menos un poco  con medio mundo   El extrano caso del Dr  Jekyll y Mr  Hyde  tiene una trama muy conocida gracias al tiempo y a diferentes adaptaciones  pero que no decae en el texto mismo  Un medico prestigioso y honrado  de las puertas de la casa para afuera  de repente se ve relacionado con un hombre  o algo que se le asemeja  que pisotea a una nina en plena calle  Eso es  a grandes rasgos  lo que le da comienzo a la historia Que Ya Sabemos  Utterson  notario y conocido de Jekyll  es quien va a llevar gran parte de la trama y empieza a atar cabos sobre el asunto  Y luego el asunto lo atara a el  porque se ve envuelto en una serie de acontecimientos horrorosos que pondrian en peligro el nombre de Jekyll y necesita tomar decisiones  Dr  Jekyll y Mr  Hyde  esta narrado de forma amena  sin complicaciones y con mucho dialogo de por medio  Hay varios sub textos que constituyen el libro  como las cartas  que permiten cambiar el punto de vista  Ademas  eso hace que el caso este contado directamente por sus protagonistas  lo cual significa que el momento de las transformaciones estan detalladas desde el interior  por ejemplo   que a veces suenan afectados  pero nunca acartonados  No es ningun descubrimiento senalar que Jekyll y Hyde acaparan toda la atencion del lector  porque tal vez Utterson sea el que mas responde a su clase y se define solo  Pero Jekyll y Hyde  en sus esporadicas apariciones  generan mas de una intriga  Engancha y se lee en una tarde  si no hay interrupciones  A pesar de que la accion refleja las concepciones de la moral victoriana   Dr  Jekyll y Mr  Hyde  no pierde vigencia  sobre todo porque el tema del bien y del mal en la humanidad jamas caduco  y no lo hara   Lo recomiendo con todos los sujetos incongruentes de mi ser  Y si  necesitaba hacer el chiste malo del dia   This classic tale is nothing but awesome  If you haven t done already  go read it  Now To be honest  I thought of this as a little bit too slow paced during the first pages  Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde were introduced in the very beginning through the main viewpoint character  Mr  Utterson  a friend of Jekyll s  from whose eyes the story is told for its major part  As soon as more and more details surrounding the true background of Mr  Hyde s existence emerge from the narrative  the story itself becomes more and more exciting  until the climax looms with an inexorable pace  cutting the story to an abrupt ending  Despite its comparatively short length  Stevenson managed to write a fascinating character study about one of the most recognized and famous characters of British literature Stevenson s verbal skills are unrivaled  drawing a convincing portrait of a conflict between good and evil  two opposed souls sharing one man s memory and fighting each other in the most obscure way    The hatred of Hyde for Jekyll was of a different order         A nd indeed  had it not been for his fear of death  he  Hyde  would long ago have ruined himself in order to involve me  Jekyll  in the ruin  But his love of life is wonderful  I go further  I  and freeze at the mere thought of him  when I recall the abjection and passion of this attachment  and when I know how he fears my power to cut him off by suicide  I find it in my heart to pity him    I wish I hadn t already been introduced to this story before finally reading it  if only because it would have become the most astonishing story I ve ever read by the mere intensity of that intense plot twist  Even though the plot was not unknown to me and the story itself was pretty short  Stevenson captured his reader with this tale of one soul ripped in half   and his perfect usage of different perspectives resulting in a piece by piece revelation of the true circumstances to the reader More than enough of the praise  This classic can be read not only for free on the Internet  but also in the course of a short time  so I cannot recommend reading it enough  And off it wanders on my list of all time favorite novels  Uma agradavel surpresa  pena a minha traducao pavorosa Opiniao em https   thefondreader wordpress com 2    It is a beautiful thing  in one s life  to come across a work of literature which is commonly regarded as a classic  and find it wholly deserving of every ounce of praise ever bestowed upon it This is the situation I have encountered while reading  The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde   Stevenson s Victorian styled narrative is so beautifully contrived  that his words flow through your mind like the music of Mozart  The language alone is worth the praise My only wish is that I could have read this legendary piece of literature with no prior knowledge of the story  However deserving this work is of all its praise  and popular retelling  I fear it has done a disservice to the original work  From Broadway musicals  to episodes of Scooby Doo  this story has been told time and again  The credit this shows to the power of the original story is due  however it sours the reader to never being able to experience it  how Stevenson originally intended There is no female love interest  to attracted the pop culture female audience  And there was no prophetic Jekyll  railing against the lack of foresight of his contemporaries in the scientific community The piece that I found most fascinating was in Stevenson s exploration of the duality of the spirit of man  It s well known that this is the main focus of this story  however  I feel it s a common misconception that Jekyll   good  and Hyde   evil  Indeed  Hyde DOES   evil  However  Jekyll is something far more complicated  Jekyll is the embodiment of both good AND evil  Jekyll is the original spirit  with good and evil wrestling within it  Through science  Jekyll is able to wrest from his soul its purely evil nature  which then becomes Hyde  When he returns to his Jekyll form  however  the evil is still present  The evil that was always there  Always lurking  Jekyll has no potion to free the purely good and holy side of the human spirit  It seems this is the very failing that spirals Jekyll uncontrollably into damnation  Never being truly free of his evil  and never being solely holy  eventually evil s strength grows and grows  until it is no longer able to be restrained Do I recommend this work  Most assuredly  And I recommend it to everyone  Everyone should read this masterpiece of literature  It s not called a classic without good reason  It s an almost perfectly plotted short novel  all the parts complementing each other  all serving to build tension and anticipation  The good doctor is suitably tragic  Hyde is suitably degenerate and  despite having seen the multitude of adaptations over the years  it still feels remarkably fresh and modern  All of Stevenson s stylistic flourishes are on show  as well as his rarely bettered storytelling ability  I d give it six stars if I could  Cinque stelle Una scrittura splendida e ricca  resa in modo veramente magistrale in questa edizione  scelta appositamente  dai mitici Fruttero e Lucentini La prima parte  quella preponderante  crea un

almeno una volta nella vita Stevenson regala alla letteratura l iconico personaggio del dottor Jekyll  inserendolo in una storia dai tratti molto cupi  anticipando i tempi su molte tematiche di psicologia Leggibile tra le righe una sottile critica alla Londra vittoriana falsamente perbenista  mentre ho trovato piu rilevante la duplicita psicologica del protagonista L acuta analisi di Stevenson mette in luce un protagonista coerente nelle sue contraddizioni in perpetua difficolta con l accettare un lato oscuro che e irrimediabilmente intrinseco alla nostra personalita Particolarmente intelligente l idea di sfumare il confine tra Jekyll e Hyde  rendendoli al contempo colpevoli e innocenti in ugual modo  il primo e ben conscio dell avida  e pericolosa  voglia di sapere  il secondo non e esente da momenti di lucidita dove prova vergogna per il male perpetrato Jekyll ed Hyde rappresentano la stessa persona  quello che cambia e l accettazione di limiti sociali ed educazionali che la cultura e la societa dovrebbero impartirci Capolavoro da leggere e rileggere  soprattutto contestualizzato all anno di uscita  Just finished re reading this book for part of my October spooky reading   in preparation of reading Hyde and Lighthousekeeping  Still love this novella    it s a perfectly crafted story  Just wish I could have been a part of the original reading public when this first came out so that I would have been completely surprised by the events of the story   October 2015                              I read The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson today   The edition I linked is one from this year   is a lovely  crisp little edition of the story   I had never read it   I must say that I  absolutely  loved it  I m a big fan of books that explore the duality of man s good evil nature   it has immediately joined my list of  favorite  books  It s a perfect short story  The story is somewhat different than what I expected  based on the lore of  Jekyll Hyde  that I knew going in    I  so  wish I had no prior knowledge of the idea of Jekyll Hyde  what a treat it must have been for the original readers of this story to be fully surprised at the revelations as they happened  Even so  it was still fabulous   wonderfully told  I enjoyed every sentence of this tense  tight tale  The writing   vocabulary are just spot on  imo  This is a great read   a classic that everyone should experience   Original review written in 2011   Actually I could have just given this book five stars when it was still in the  Currently Reading  tray  as of course it s not the first time I ve read Jekyll and Hyde  What still continues to amaze me though is how gripping and compulsive this tale remains  even though the one thing everybody knows about it is  in fact  the twist On re reading this book I m struck by how much it seems to say about Victorian hypocrisy  The characters within are mainly good and decent professional people  bound by the rules of politeness and correctness  Yet there is a barely repressed sexual anxiety right the way through  Utterson  the lawyer who is the reader s eyes throughout the book   wonders at the level of intimacy which exists between Hyde and Jekyll  he frets at what sin might lie in the good doctor s past for this monster to have a hold over him  he worries at what kind of disease may affect a man s mind and keep him locked away from the world all day  Nothing is overtly stated  as that wouldn t be the done thing   but the fear of moral transgression is there throughout the book  and the fact it can t be talked about just makes it more shadowy and sinister  For most of the story the dread is not that Dr Jekyll has gone against the laws of nature  but that he has gone against the rules of society And yet it is clear how liberated Mr Hyde is by his evil doings  by his breaking of these repressive strictures  Indeed he seems to draw his power  which eventually subsumes Dr Jekyll  from his capacity to act outside of society s norms  Of course the trampling of the girl and the murder of the MP are truly reprehensible  but there are other   seemingly more enjoyable   sins that Hyde indulges in  These  crimes  are ones that give Jekyll pleasure when remembering them in his own self  and the fact that they can t be named suggests these are matters of the flesh This book could not have been written to the same effect at any other point in history  Stevenson has created a tale which fears the social disgrace and moral degradation of seedy London  while simultaneously desiring to revel in it  CapolavoroRomanzo tanto famoso  quanto erroneamente interpretato  soprattutto a motivo di un approccio superficiale o addirittura inesistente alla sua lettura  La semplicistica contrapposizione tra un Dr  Jekyll bigotto e bacchettone e un Mr  Hyde gaudente e trasgressivo  con una chiara oscillazione delle simpatie verso quest ultimo  non ha senso  infatti Hyde non e  altro  da Jakyll  ne la sua versione disinibita  e Jekyll stesso  cosi come si trasforma in seguito all assunzione di una pozione  guarda caso   impura   e il male che e in Jeckyll  distillato nella sua essenza piu spaventosa e atroce  perche separato dal bene  in una scissione contro natura di quelle componenti positive e negative che albergano in ogni essere umano  Per questo e di bassa statura e di costituzione piu esile rispetto a Jekyll  per il fatto che ne e soltanto una parte  una componente  Per questo ispira sgomento e orrore in chi lo avvicina  non perche sia brutto o deforme  come di norma viene raffigurato nelle trasposizioni cinematografiche   ma per il fatto che da lui irradia un aura indefinita di mostruosita  di  inumanita   in quanto non puo considerarsi umano un essere ricolmo unicamente di pulsioni maligne e delittuose  Indefinito  nel senso di non enumerato ne descritto  e anche il genere di colpe di cui Hyde si rende responsabile  con l esito di ampliare fino all enorme  al raccapricciante  all impensabile il potere emozionale del non detto  Le scelte stilistiche dell autore sono sapientemente intese in questo senso  ovvero a concentrare sul mistero  su cio che e taciuto  la potenza suggestiva del racconto  in un climax di intensita e tensione che culmina con le straordinarie pagine della confessione di Jekyll  Vero miracolo di perfezione compositiva  questo romanzo ad ogni rilettura suggerisce nuove riflessioni e dischiude nuovi tesori  cio accade soltanto per i capolavori   Stevensons bekannteste Erzahlung kann man in der Ubertragung von Friedhelm Rathjen  die in der schon aufgemachten Ausgabe in seiner selbst verlegten ReJoyce Reihe wieder zuganglich gemacht ist  neu entdecken  Unterschiedliche wechselnde Tonfalle und individuelle Redeweisen der Personen lassen den Text fast modern wirken  Wie auch in seiner Moby Dick Ubersetzung erhalt Rathjen dem deutschen Leser die sprachlichen Eigenheiten des Originals und beschert ein grossartiges Texterlebnis  das die  klassischen  Ubersetzungen vor enthielten  Yes everyone knows the story but it s great to read the original  I did this with Frankenstein  Or  The Modern Prometheus and was actually a bit disappointed as the film s  had distorted it but this one has remained untouched and I really enjoyed it  Such a great classic Found this 1980 s leather bound edition while antiquing last weekend which made the reading all the more enjoyable  Love my IPad  but will always prefer holding the real thing  Clasico ejemplo de la tematica del doble  del bien y el mal  del titanismo propugnado por los Romanticos en esta pequena  pero gran  novela salida de la pluma genial de Stevenson  Un clasico que demuestra que no necesita tener 1000 paginas para ser inolvidable    Classic  No doubt about it  The plot idea is unbelievably imaginative and dark  The language can be challenging at times  but it s definitely worth the extra work and time to understand and make sense of it  One of my favourite pieces of literature  Top notch  Najzad sam seo i procitao ovu knjizicu  klasik knjizevnosti i moram da priznam zasluzila je sve pohvale kojom je obasipaju  U sustini u knjizi se malo toga dogadja vec vecim delom citamo pisma ili imamo obicne razgovore ali opet ubaciti tolko jeze i horora bez upotrebe nekih klasicnih klisea prosto maestralno Jedino sto moram da priznam knjiga mi je bila teska za citanje posto nisam navikao na taja cvetni  gospodski govor engleza 18 19 veka pa me je to dosta usporavalo posto sam morao mnogo vise da se koncentrisem nego inace U svakom slucaju svaka preporuka   The idea of this one is fascinating   Delightful The secret to a top notch reading experience is to forget everything you know about Jekyll and Hyde  Stevenson sets it all up as a mystery  there s a dastardly man named Hyde running around  trampling young girls  murdering members of parliament  et cetera  The reader sees the story through the eyes of the affable but rather dull lawyer Mr  Utterson  friend of Dr  Jekyll  who finds himself irresistibly drawn to the mystery of Hyde Anyway  Stevenson sets it up perfectly and he lands it perfectly  And he does it in a small number of pages  which is something to be admired    Ma se sono diventato    quello che sono diventato    lo devo alla mia smodata ambizione di essere un punto di riferimento morale  non certo agli errori commessi  Ed e per quella smodata ambizione che  giovanissimo  tracciai dentro di me un solco profondo fra due fratelli gemelli  il bene e il male  che dividono e uniscono  a un tempo  la duplice natura dell uomo  Ma per quanto fossi cosi  doppio   non ero affatto un ipocrita  Ero sincero sia nel bene che nel male  che coesistevano dentro di me  Quando abbandonavo ogni ritegno per tuffarmi nell infamia  ero me stesso ne piu ne meno di quando mi adoperavo per alleviare le sofferenze della povera gente Avvenne cosi che i miei studi scientifici gettassero una viva luce sulla consapevolezza di una perenne conflittualita tra bene e male  Non solo  ma capii che l uomo non e uno  ma due  come le facce di una medaglia  Fu in campo morale e sulla mia persona che imparai a riconoscere il dualismo profondo e primordiale dell uomo Mi resi conto che  delle due nature che si dilaniavano nella mia coscienza  io non avevo preferenze  perche appartenevo completamente a entrambe  E fu allora che cominciai a sognare ad occhi aperti la possibilita di separare il bene dal male   Se questa ipotesi fosse possibile   pensavo   avremmo uomini interamente buoni e uomini interamente cattivi  Il gemello ingiusto potrebbe compiere le sue nefandezze senza farsi distrarre dalla coscienza che gli chiede di perseguire il bene  perche la sua felicita sarebbe fare il male  Il gemello giusto  a sua volta  compirebbe il bene tranquillo e sicuro  senza neppure accorgersi delle tentazioni del male  perche la sua felicita sarebbe fare il bene  Era la maledizione del genere umano che questi gemelli antitetici  cosi legati tra loro  si dilaniassero perennemente nel grembo tormentoso della coscienza  Come fare  allora  a dissociarli    It s a puzzle  a mystery  a combination of accounts that the reader must piece together to discover the true natures of these men  Everyone knows the basic premise  but the book itself is a masterwork of narratives that slowly constructs a riddle of human nature  Perhaps a strange beginning  but short enough to read again and again  pondering all the while  This will affect how you view humanity  regardless of religion or worldview   Supongo que esto se debe a que todos los seres humanos  tal como los conocemos  son una mezcla de bien y de mal  en tanto que Edward Hyde  sin antecedentes en la historia de la humanidad  era ejemplo exclusivo del mal Este libro es perfecto  Comentar Dr  Jekyll y Mr  Hyde sin dar explicaciones resulta dificil  pero creo que todo el mundo deberia leerlo  Es una novela con altas dosis de intriga  misterio  sorpresa  suspenso y muchas emociones  La narracion es excelente y a cada pagina vas queriendo saber mas sobre este doctor respetado llamado Harry Jekyll y su amigo tan extrano  de forma fisica y en actitud  llamado Edward Hyde  La novela es tipo detectivesca  pero tambien busca exaltar las formas del yo  y mostrarnos las perversidades del ser humano  En mi edicion tambien se encuentran tres historias   Historia del hombre de las tartas de crema   incluido en El club del suicidio  Tambien se encuentran  El diablo de la botella  y  Olalla   Las historias igualmente tienen un aire de misterio y algo de fantastico  ademas del tono detectivesco  Hay muertes y cuestionamientos de la vida  Las historias terminan siendo adictivas Altamente recomendado y una de las experiencias de lectura mas placenteras  Edebiyat ve sinema dallarindaki coklu kisilik bozukluguna sahip olan  Hulk  Gollum  Two face gibi  karakterlere yon veren  Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde   Dr  Jekyll ile Bay Hyde   insan psikolojisini ve dogasini mercek altina yatiran  iyi ile kotunun savasini metaforik bir sekilde okuyucuya sunan gercek bir basyapit niteliginde  Robert

e intrigante  encontramos accion y suspenso en todas las paginas  Me ha fascinado    Mislim da nema osobe koja nije citala ili cula za pricu doktora Dzekila i gospodina Hajda  Davno sam je citala

A chilling tale which details the interplay between the forces of good and evil  A physician scientist endeavors to segregate his personality through alchemy into a  dual self  by isolating the good into one being and of evil into another  The consequences are tragic  At once  the narrative becomes an allegory for humankind  depicting the devilish results which occur when a human soul  through choice  gives innocent  or at least thoughtless license to darkness  Stevenson sequentially and artfully weaves this intriguing account into a masterpiece  It has been some years since I read Robert Louis Stevenson s book  Treasure Island  and I had forgotten what a gifted writer he is  He is a consummate wordsmith and has what seems to me to be a total command of the English language  His selection of words and their careful placement one after the other is breath taking and  for me  took precedence over the story line itself  Though England Scotland has produced many great authors  all with their separate abilities to deliver a great story  none I think surpass the shere brilliance of Stevenson s literary style  This book is a must read   Halfway through the first chapter of Robert Louis Stevenson s 1886 novella  The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  a character named Richard Enfield says   I took the liberty of pointing out to my gentleman that the whole business looked apocryphal  and that a man does not  in real life  walk into a cellar door at four in the morning and come out with another man s check for close upon a hundred pounds   He conveys this to his lawyer cousin  Mr  Gabriel Utterson  as he recounts the odd story he has of the  gentleman   a certain Mr  Edward Hyde  who one night deliberately trampled a little girl after she accidentally bumped into him  Several bystanders  including Mr  Enfield and the girl s family  witnessed the incident and were quick to seize the offender  However  Mr  Hyde was just as quick to think up a way to appease them  he entered a nearby door and quickly produced a check for a substantial amount signed by one Dr  Henry Jekyll  a distinguished gentleman who  as it turns out  is one of Mr  Utterson s clients  I cite the above line of dialogue as I think that  as innocuous as it sounds  it is a near perfect prefigurement of the essential characteristics of the excellent short novel where it is from  For one thing  it is spoken by a character in a burst of submission to gossip  thus itself qualifying as something of doubtful veracity  which in turn can also be said of the rest of the book  There s the mention of a man apparently posing as another  claiming no less than the other s signature as his own  However  it s not the book s subject  a man with a split personality  that lends an air of intriguing dubiousness to the narrative so much as the structure of the narrative itself  Stevenson s authorial technique is one which allows for a spellbinding sense of mystery to hang relentlessly over his story  For the most part  the story is told by a narrator who only knows as much as the characters about what exactly is going on  But near the end Stevenson abandons the third person narrative and transforms his novella into an epistolary tale  focusing on two revelatory letters  one written by Dr  Jekyll and the other by a colleague  addressed to Mr  Utterson  who I ought to point out is the real central character of the story  the fulcrum about which the two title characters move  But how much of the revelations contained in these letters  including Dr  Jekyll s reflection on the duality of man   Man is not truly one  but truly two     are true  when the circumstances under which they were created are already beyond Mr  Utterson s  or indeed  anyone s  belief  What is not open to question  though  is Stevenson s grace of style  as exemplified by the phrase  cellar door  arguably the most phonetically beautiful word combination in the English language  in Mr  Enfield s quintessential line  Stevenson s wife famously said that the story of Jekyll and Hyde came to her husband in a dream  It s no wonder then that it reads like one  terrifying like a nightmare and at the same time exhilarating like a trance  His talent is particularly evident in his numerous  mostly gothic  dreamlike descriptions of unpleasant meteorological conditions the characters are forced to deal with  Following the murder of an old gentleman in the hands of Mr  Hyde  Stevenson writes   It was by this time about nine in the morning  and the first fog of the season  A great chocolate coloured pall lowered over heaven  but the wind was continually charging and routing these embattled vapours     Then  when Mr  Utterson sets out to finally confront his client  the narrator observes    It was a wild  cold  seasonable night of March  with a pale moon  lying on her back as though the wind had tilted her  and a flying wrack of the most diaphanous and lawny texture  The wind made talking difficult  and flecked the blood into the face   Like Alice in Wonderland  Gulliver s Travels  and Moby Dick  Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde is one of those classic books whose stories most of us already know from somewhere  often from countless adaptations across various media and quick plot summaries stumbled upon while surfing Wikipedia  but haven t actually read  We know it s about a man who leads a double life  a man who oscillates between being the two title characters  one of whom is mostly good and the other downright evil  but how many of us  knowing full well that the entire text is available in the public domain  have actually gone out of our ways to experience the real deal I for one lament that my introduction to Stevenson s landmark story was by way of Dr  Jekyll and Ms  Hyde  a movie I remember watching on VHS with my family when I was in fourth grade  It starred Tim Daly as a descendant of Dr  Jekyll who  in a supposedly clever twist to the original story  transforms into a voluptuous woman played by Sean Young after an experiment gone awry  I was only ten then  naive and easily pleased  and seeing a man metamorphose into a woman with long hair and ample breasts amused me to no end  It was not until fifteen years later  as I breezed through a Jon Gray designed Headline Review  The Best Adventure Stories Ever  edition of the book which I found while rummaging through a bargain table in a secondhand book shop  that I realized what a travesty it was  even for a loose comedy film adaptation of this truly amazing short novel    Cross posted on Fully Booked  Me  One of the four Victorian novels that I have to read as part of my Victorian Literature module in my Foundation Degree  along with North   South which I ve read  and The Woman in White   Great Expectations  which I haven t   this was a quick  classic read that s free on the Kindle Fire in the UK at least   I ve always loved this book and like a favorite film  I find myself revisiting it every few years just because  It doesn t hurt that at 97 pages it is the perfect length for my morning walk on the treadmill Reading it again today  it occurred to me that most of us read this book already knowing Dr  Jekyll s secret  while the original audience was doubly blessed with an element of suspense as the mystery slowly unfolded Overall a good  quick read packed with meaning  A truly timeless classic  it has been studied and analyzed out the wazoo  It s an unavoidable part of pop culture and has provided the foundation and inspiration for many characters written since and  I suspect  those still unwritten    khyr nhyt ry    rwbrt lwys styfnswn   dktwr jykl wmstr hyd rwy  mn lmfrwD nh khyly  wlknh mn wjh  nZry Hqyq  tmm wtTrH sw l trykhy  mn nHn  nHn lshkhS

puede contener spoilers  aunque estos son conocidos por casi todos   Hace mucho tiempo que tenia ganas de leer este libro  pero por alguna u otra razon no lo hacia  Ahora queria leer algo corto  y cuando me puse a ver que seria lo siguiente que leyera me decidi por este finalmente El extrano caso de dr  Jekyll y mr  Hyde puede encajar dentro de varios generos  novela de terror  de terror psicologico  fantastico  o bien un ensayo de la psicologia humana  Para empezar a hablar sobre lo que me parecio el libro tendria que mencionar tres puntos claves que hicieron que el relato me gustara tanto  En primer lugar  los personajes  y principalmente sus pensamientos y o sentimientos estan increiblemente bien desarrollados  La descripcion del miedo y la repulsion que Utterson sentia por Hyde no podria haber sido mejor  El autor usa un vocabulario muy amplio que permite mostrar a la perfeccion lo que sienten sus personajes y estos lo transmiten plenamente al lector  o por lo menos es lo que me parecio a mi  En segundo lugar  todo el texto en el que se describe la situacion de Jekyll Hyde es espectacular  Todo lo que se narra permite entender cual es su situacion  como sucedio y como fue cambiando su pensamiento respecto de ella  Mientras leia  esta parte me hacia acordar a Frankenstein  de Mary Shelley  mientras en la novela de Stevenson  al principio  Jekyll deseaba con todas sus fuerzas convertirse en Hyde para saciar sus mas ocuros deseos  Viktor solamente podia pensar en finalizar su creacion  Al mismo tiempo  cuando Jekyll se da cuenta de lo que representa su otra personalidad  la aborrece completamente  al doctor Frankenstein le sucede lo mismo cuando ve a la criatura que el creo y se da cuenta de que habia roto una de las reglas morales mas presentes de su epoca  Por ultimo  la diferencia entre los personajes de Jekyll y Hyde son muy notorias  Eso me parecio esencial para que la trama tenga sentido  y el autor supo elaborar un personaje del que se desprende otro mas igual de importante que el original  Probablemente  me habria dado mas intriga no saber como se desarrolla la historia y su final  pero  igualmente  conocerlo no me impidio hacer un analisis sobre otros aspectos del libro igual de interesantes  Do 5 stelline perche la prima volta che ho letto questo libro avevo 15 16 anni ed ero rimasta estasiata  Purtroppo avevo dovuto leggere la versione corta e in inglese per la scuola  quindi non era esattamente come leggere il libro vero  Ricordo di aver amato questa storia e ora che mi sono trovata a rileggerla ho scoperto di aver perso un po  di quell amore  forse perche sapevo quello che sarebbe successo  Spesso quando rileggi piu volte un libro hai la sensazione che sia sempre la prima volta perche scopri particolari in piu  vedi cose che prima non avevi visto  Altre volte  invece  sai che un certo libro potrai rileggerlo infinite volte ma non proverai piu quello che hai provato la prima volta che lo hai letto  E purtroppo per me Lo strano caso del dr Jekyll e di Mr Hyde rientra nel secondo caso  Ho dato le 5 stelline piu per la prima volta che l ho letto che non per questa  Ma se le merita tutte perche e una storia che ti prende e ti porta in un mondo in cui devi capire che il bene e il male esistono in una sola persona e che se si prova a dividerli  le conseguenze sono assolutamente pessime  Avrei tanto voluto che il libro fosse piu lungo  o per lo meno che Jekyll avesse piu spazio   Most people are familiar with the story of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde  it is such a big part of our literary history that one need only mention those names and the reference is immediately understood  Imagine my surprise then upon finally reading the novella to find that there were nuances to the story that I had never fully appreciated  I had thought that this was a scientific experiment gone horribly wrong  that Jekyll had used himself as the guinea pig  that he found the evil acts of Hyde totally reprehensible but learned to his horror that he could not control Hyde  Ah   no  I learned that it was the release of the evil side of Jekyll s personality that he sought through transcendental experimentation because he was tired of hiding his naughty  fun loving side under the persona of the good  law abiding doctor  He was delighted to be Hyde at first because he could let Hyde do whatever he pleased  enjoy those walks on the dark side and not be bothered by a guilty conscience afterwards  Then he began to have second thoughts about the wiseness of his extracurricular activites and decided to give that all up cold turkey  which lasted all of two months when  like an addict  he backslid and decided to enjoy Hyde for one more evening  Upon being released by the dose again  Hyde burst forth with even greater  pent up rage  which with nothing to stop him  resulted in his murdering a prominent citizen and worse yet  being observed in the act and identified  Now it was even more important to keep Hyde under wraps but to Jekyll s horror  Hyde began to reappear at will  he was becoming much stronger and Jekyll weaker  Jekyll was even afraid to sleep  And then the greatest horror was learning that one of the chemicals that reversed the transformation was no longer working properly  had been perhaps tainted to begin with  The end to the dilemma became a choice between the gallows or suicide  Great horror story  I love that the idea came to Stevenson in a dream   Reading Robert Louis Stevenson s classic The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  I was reminded of Mary Shelley s Frankenstein  Both novels involve the idea of tampering with science in a controversial way and expecting positive results  Much like Victor Frankenstein learns that you can t  play God   Dr  Jekyll comes to realize the dark side of experimentation gone wrong  Neither character has the resolve to own up and take responsibility of their actions until things are well out of hand  As much as the novel illustrates how the results of science can turn awry  the story also questions duality within oneself  In the novel  the rational side  Jekyll  of a man is tempted into various forms of sin and sinister behavior  Hyde   One side soon becomes the more dominant of the two  and there is a struggle to escape from this dark side  When Jekyll becomes Hyde  he erupts into various forms of grotesqueness  Hyde is physically repulsive  but also repulsive in character  Hyde in many ways is an outlet for Jekyll to experience unrelenting freedom and  do as he pleases   despite the costs or consequences  It s ironic that this newfound  freedom  for Jekyll s other self actually turns into a form of a prison  where he has to physically isolate and hide himself from society to protect others  The many morals it delves into and investigates make this an amazing reading experience  There are also many thinking points about human psychology and human nature  In many ways  this novel is groundbreaking and innovative  ahead of its time  It s easy to see why this novel has spawned countless film adaptations and productions  remaining quite popular and part of our pop culture  Not only that  but this novel is just a great book  well written and with so many different elements  It has exceptional moments of suspense  mystery  philosophy  science  and a darkly Gothic atmosphere to lure you in  Stevenson s novel is one to read  and then come back to and read again    I Want to Be Evil  by Eartha Kitt would be an excellent theme song for this story  And  it could easily have been a Twightlight Zone episode of 1961 Here is a book that I have never seen a movie  cartoon or play  I ve heard over a thousand times the expression  Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  to describe people  but never knew the  whole  story  I know   Where have YOU been     I can t answer that  All I know is that I WENT IN FRESH  Thank goodness  It is spellbinding  You feel the suspense right from the first few pages The main theme of this novella is the conflict of good vs  evil  A London lawyer named Gabriel John Utterson investigates strange occurrences between his old friend  Dr  Henry Jekyll  and sinister Edward Hyde  The investigation keeps you wondering  what secret is Dr  Jekyll hiding  I fell in love with Robert Louis Stevenson s writing  He sets the mood so perfectly on the streets of London  My favorite description he wrote is   for here it would be dark like the back end of evening  and there would be a glow of a rich  lurid brown  like the light of some strange conflagration  and here  for a moment  the fog would be quite broken up  and a haggard shaft of daylight would glance in between the swirling wreaths   Aaaagghh  that is so beautiful  The last chapter is phenomenal  This is where everything is explained explicitly  This chapter works your brain  Very deep  It makes you think about yourself and how much good and evil is lurking inside you  I definitely want to read more of Stevenson s books and poems  I recommend this book to the SANE  Stiv ns n  podobno na Melvil  e poznat poradi vsichki greshni prichini  Nishcho obshcho s ekranizatsiite  ostavili izkriven obraz v pametta mi   Lee la resena completa en Hojas de Otono                            Hay algo plenamente retorcido en este libro que me ha encantado a sobremanera  Considero fascinante el modo en que Stevenson plasma ese temor humano a cometer errores  Yo supongo que la razon por la cual he adorado tanto este libro  ademas de la escritura del autor que me parecio impecable   es principalmente por mi carrera  Este libro cuenta con un gran contenido psicologico que para aquel que sepa apreciarlo  sin duda enganchara hasta la ultima pagina  No deja mas que dar la aceptacion del ser humano como un todo  no como la aglomeracion de individualidades   I got the impression it was about drug addiction or Stevenson s own abuse with some kind of substance  as much as it was about our own unwanted dark desires  Like all great horror books  it has these layers that go past just suspense and dread  Este cruel retrato de la lucha entre la razon y el instinto se disfruta mas si no conoces nada de nada de los personajes   Uno de mis clasicos favoritos http   muydenovelas blogspot com es 2    A heck of a lot more philosophical than the Bugs Bunny rendition with which I was familiar  I actuall  like this book a lot   The eternal battle of Good v Evil   A man and a child accidentally bump into each other at a street corner   a normal everyday incident  But when the child falls down  the man deliberately tramples over her  ignoring her screams of pain  When he is stopped by passers by  he shows no remorse  This is the reader s first introduction to Mr Hyde  a man who has no obvious deformity but gives off an air so repellent that strangers passing him in the street shudder without knowing why  But this man has some kind of hold over the eminently respectable and well known scientist  Dr Jekyll  who not only pays compensation for Hyde s actions  but also gives him the run of his own house  and has made out his will in Hyde s favour  leaving him everything should Jekyll die    or disappear  Jekyll s friend and lawyer is at a loss to understand  but feels it his duty to discover more about the mysterious Mr Hyde   Because the story has become so phenomenally well known  the reader is way ahead of Mr Utterson  the lawyer  In the novella  it s not till near the end that it s revealed that Mr Hyde is the result of a scientific experiment gone horribly wrong  But it s so well written that knowing the story doesn t hamper enjoyment in any way  Stevenson builds up the tension and horror beautifully  with one of the best uses of London fog I ve come across  both as providing a cloak for wickedness and vice  and as a metaphor for the darkness within each human soul  Darkness features throughout  with fog rolling into houses  and Mr Utterson having to face the terrifying climax with only the feeble flicker of a candle to light his way Dr Jekyll refuses to tell Mr Utterson anything about his strange friend  but assures him that he could get rid of Hyde any time he chose  Mr Utterson has to accept that and let the matter rest  But one day  months later  a woman looking out of a window sees a horrifically brutal murder take place  The description she gives of the murderer could only be of Hyde  Mr Utterson races to Hyde s address in sleazy Soho  but too late  He has vanished  Dr Jekyll seems nervy and upset  but after a while begins to get back into his old routines  Then some weeks later  Mr Utterson receives a visit from Dr Jekyll s servant   it appears that Mr Hyde is back   There is more than an element of morality tale about the story  Dr Jekyll has always liked to indulge his vices   mostly left  incidentally  to the reader s imagination  which works so much better than lengthy graphic descriptions would have done  But now that he has become a well known figure  he has to think about his reputation  So he decides the solution is to split his personality between good and evil  But the experiment doesn t work the way he hopes   the Hyde side is indeed purely evil  but the Jekyll side doesn t change   he still retains all his vices and weaknesses even when in that guise  and gradually the Hyde side begins to take control  The suggestion is that  if one gives in to one s evil side  it will always become dominant  so we must guard against it at all times  It s not nearly as preachy as I ve probably just made it sound  though  First and foremost  it s a thrilling  chilling tale of horror  Great stuff  I hereby forgive Stevenson for boring me in Kidnapped   www fictionfanblog wordpress com Robert Louis Stevenson in essiz ve

deaktive olsaydi  neler yapardik  I ll admit it   I ve deliberately avoided reading this book for years  I suppose it s entered folk lore and spreads through thoughts and cultures still  It s revered by many and I was a little concerned that I d be disappointed by the book  What a fool I ve been When I was in the library a couple of weeks ago  it was there face out and calling to me  It seemed so slight and vulnerable among the weighty tomes that I just had to do it  Boy  am I glad I did Unfortunately  I forgot to write down my memorable quotes before returning it  but there s so much for you to find out about this one that my lack of input is hardly going to matter I was somewhat taken aback by the brilliance of this story First of all  there s the way the story is revealed in snapshots  The disquiet and the sinister aspects of the story bite straight away  but I was always hungry to unpeel another layer to get to the bottom of things  even with my prior knowledge of what I would eventually find  imagine reading a book like this with no sense of what it was about   how amazing that would have been  The language is exquisite  A vocabulary that s at least a couple of pegs above my own is used to keep things tight and minimal  With very few words  Stevenson manages to offer a complete picture of a scene or an idea The characters are superb  from the upper strata of the social set to the butlers and servants of the world  Extraneous story elements just don t exist  In one scene  the lawyer Utterson visits a doctor to find out information  The scene is set and time and place are perfectly fixed  In terms of the conversation  there s no fluff  All the preamble is missing and all that s offered is the meat that is necessary to feed the tale I d love it if some of the craft and skill on show here were to seep into my words and wonder how much better I might be as a writer if I d come to this a long time ago The book s brilliant  The horror and darkness are cold and clammy  The plight of Jekyll is terrible yet understandable  who wouldn t enjoy that liberation from the cerebral ways of the human for a while   and absolutely tragic The only question I am left with related to the pronunciation of the author s name  A friend of mine tells me the middle name should be pronounce  Lewis  and he generally knows  Maybe drop a comment if you concur All in all  it s a must read   don t hesitate and pop down to the library or load that kindle right away   either way  it s free   Me cuesta trabajo creer que Stevenson escribia bajo la influencia de la cocaina  Estos cuentos son sobrios  solemnes y bien pulidos  Sus narraciones tienen una directriz oscura  pero no vacia  te guia por la anecdota como quien te lleva de la mano apuradamente para mostrarte una sorpresa y entonces no sabes que te mostrara  pero sabes por la andanza que sera algo bueno En cuanto al  cuento estelar  de estos relatos  entiendo por que Jekyll y Hyde se convirtieron en un fenomeno cultural  No se trata de una persona que brinca del bien al mal como tristemente se ha hecho creer  sino de materializar toda la maldad que cada individuo conlleva en si  Jekyll es un compuesto del bien y el mal  el lleva a Hyde en si mismo  mientras que Hyde es puramente el  se desentiende de la moral y la etica del doctor  no asi con Jekyll que observa  reprueba y considera lo que Hyde es y construye  No es pues el angel y el diablo en un cuerpo  es un cuerpo que puede exponer la parte malvada que lo conforma  A esto  agregar que Hyde no es un monstruo gigantesco  tosco y  hulkiano  como lo pintan muchas pantallas  sino un ser enano  encorvado  complexion justificada por el propio Jekyll que se recrimina el mal reprimido que guardaba durante tantos anos y que finalmente vino a convertirse en el andante Hyde  no fuera de Jekyll  sino usurpando el espacio que por naturaleza tambien es el suyo Con esta seleccion que hace Valdemar de los cuentos de Stevenson  me quedo con una sensacion de fantasmas en la mente  cobran presencia  debaten sobre la virtud y la monstruosidad  alzan la mano en protesta de su lugar reducido a un  tu no existas   El extrano caso del doctor Jekyll y Mr  Hyde evidencia la catastrofe personal que seria el tener demonios permisibles  tangibles que no porque se supriman quiere decir que no estan alli   Beginnings We start the tale by a long description of Mr Utterson  later on we learn that he is a friend of Dr Jekyll who employs his services as lawyer  We learn that this lawyer is able to love things but abstain from being without them for long periods  such as his love for the theatre which he has not seen for 20 years  it appears he is a patient man  This ability of abstention can be seen in his relationships  with his friends such as Dr Jekyll where over the years contact has dwindled  Mr Utterson is used as the opening for the book  he introduces the tone of the novel from his statements of  I let my brother go to the devil   However the description of him goes on to illustrate that his few friends were from a long  deep cultivated relationship  as ivy grows  The scene is set on the streets of London with Mr Utterson and his cousin Mr Enfield walking together rapt in discussion about an incident that Mr Enfield witnessed and was involved in  The eerie tale is recited to Mr Utterson who although he digresses does not get involved with such strange occurrences  finds himself engrossed in finding out the mystery of Mr Hyde and his relationship with his dear friend Dr Jekyll EndingsThroughout the book we discover the mystery of Mr Hyde and see the true relationship between him and Dr Jekyll  In the end we see the hopeless actions of Mr Utterson who now strives to save his brother from the devil  but is to late to stop Dr Jekyll s on his course of destruction  Dr Jekyll recounts his tale and his last moments in letter at the end of the novel  In this letter we see Dr Jekyll consumed by his desires  consumed by the evil nature of the heart  We see how he lost himself to the addiction of a life of certain freedom  of no constraints  of not being him  being another person  It is human nature illustrated so poignantly not wanting to be yourself  We are shown how Dr Jekyll walked into the sea  to drown himself in that perception of freedom  On the whole the novel is about an identity crisis  and is heavily imbued with sacrilegious themes  of science meddling in creation  in the soul and how ultimately the human desire in science will lead to untimely destruction of human kind  Introducing CharacterStevenson true to the thriller genre establishes the entrance of Mr Hyde classically  shrouded in mystery  The entire novel is the slow bone chilling introduction of Mr Hyde  an evil being  whose very existence is heretical  The malevolent spirit is emitted from the very first mention of this unknown disfigured gentleman stalking the streets on London  Throughout the novel we are teased with savage imagery and the immoral streaks of this Mr Hyde who is presented as Dr Jekyll tormentor  However Mr Hyde did not ask to be created  it was Dr Jekyll s continued addicted relationship with the release  to create such a creature and then confine it  to deny it freedom would not drive anyone insane  So in the end were we introduced to a savage monster  or a misunderstood victim not knowing how to survive  Who was the tormentor Mr Hyde or Dr Jekyll  a scientist obsessed with the destruction of the human spirit  In the pinnacle moments did Mr Hyde take hold of the only thing in his possession  the only thing in his control his life  along with his captor  his tormentor  Narrative ViewpointThe main plot is witnessed in the account of three characters Mr Utterson  Dr Jekyll and Doctor Lanyon  The three are close friends who over the years have drifted apart yet are still closely bonded by their experiences together  We are shown the disintegration of these three brothers who are all in someway consumed by the devil  Dr Jekyll and Doctor Lanyon is perspective both acquired through letters  which hold the voices of the dead  containing their secrets  their anguish and the causes of their demise  The perception of situation is also seen from Pooel a servant in the Dr Jekyll household  and Mr Enfield  both in conversation with Mr Utterson  The perspective seen from these two characters are mainly fillers for the blank periods of time  The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde is the recordings of Mr Utterson s investigation of Mr Hyde  Extrinsic Attitudes There are a number of influences and links that can be seen reflecting the society in the late 19th century  The stand off between the religious attitude in society and the meddling scientists was extremely strong  The scientific community in the late 19th century had a post Darwinian perspective  they were also beginning to examine various biological influences on human morality  including drug and alcohol addiction  homosexuality  multiple personality disorder  and regressive animality  The novella portrays human nature and how the ultimate desires leads it destruction  It submits a message that we should not play with things that we don t understand however the doctor pushes boundaries  he puts himself in a position of God  Although to learn  to experiment is what advances  what progresses humankind although this desire may end up consuming us  Scientists  doctors are seen in some sense as noble  yet Dr Jekyll though deluded felt he was doing something right in the beginning to understand the human psyche  However to meddle with the mind  will have no good outcome  it shows that there are places where we should still not venture  The evil in the novel is reflected in deformities shown in the appearance of Mr Hyde  it also demonstrates the society s reaction to those different  However could not the true representation of evil be seen in Dr Jekyll someone who could create such a sacrilegious existence  The fable of Mr Hyde could have been influenced through tales such as bogeyman like Mr Hyde the bogeyman s appearance depends on the beholder  however both are seen as an embodiment of terror  In the end to this society it was message that they should not reach for the stars  they are not Gods    It was a wild  cold  seasonable night of March  with a pale moon  lying on her back  as though the wind had tilted her  and a flying wrack of the most diaphanous and lawny texture  The wind made talking difficult  and flecked the blood into the face  It seemed to have swept the streets unusually bare of passengers  besides  for Mr  Utterson thought he had never seen that part of London so deserted  He could have wished it otherwise  never in his life had he been conscious of so sharp a wish to see and touch his fellow creatures  for  struggle as he might  there was borne in upon his mind a crushing anticipation of calamity   Honestly  I hadn t read anything from Stevenson before  I read this book on a whim really because I received it in the mail from Easton Press  It was short  about 120 pages  and I had heard so much of this story before  how many movies had I seen of this  Yet what I read really blew me away  I honestly loved it  Stevenson nailed the last chapter so powerfully to describe the duality of motives within us  On one hand  we want to do good  yet on the other hand  evil is right there with us  That which we feed becomes stronger in a sense  though in truth it is only possibly through the power of the Holy Spirit to ever do good  Yet it was brilliant  it was only somewhat archaic because I knew the plot  But imagine reading this book for the first time  never ever imagining the outcome to be the way it was  There is little stretch to understand the popularity of Stevenson when he came over to the states after it s publication  I doubt even Hunger Games sold as much  Please read and enjoy  It will be well worth your time  This is why I love the classics  This short little book is so very powerful and gives such a raw glimpse into the struggle that everyone has faced more then once in our lives I found myself relating to the characters in this story quite a bit  The overall theme in this book is something that I believe everyone can relate to  How often do we  as humans fall into something simply through our own carelessness only to find ourselves addicted and attempting to escape the darkness that we have caused ourselves to fall into The evil in this short story is quite believable  Robert Louis Stevenson is a genius  Instead of a sociopath  we simply have the error and evil of human self  Really  Stevenson summed up the emotions  error  and thinking of the human mind so perfectly  We THINK that we are simply testing something out and we won t become addicted or ensnared by it  but in the end it only destroys us  In the beginning we think we are strong enough to resist the evils that we have seen others fall into  but as time goes on and we become more and more wrapped up in whatever force has us ensnared we find that we are destroying ourselves and we must escape the darkness that we have fallen into  I didn t find this book depressing  I found it raw and real  I re read various pages several times because I could relate so much to what Stevenson was attempting to show the reader  He did it quite well in fact  Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde is an amazing piece of literature         Love  Love  Love  Full review to come  I recently read Robert Louis Stevenson s Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  and I would recommend that everyone read this short  insightful book at some point  The story has had a large impact on my own thinking  because I read it over a week ago and I still cannot get it off of my mind  If you have not read this story  I am sure that you are at least familiar with the work  Christians would benefit greatly from this book because it reveals man s sinfulness  his need for the gospel  and the importance of community Many people view Dr  Jekyll as the  good  personality and Mr  Hyde as the  evil  personality  We easily look to Hyde as the evil one for committing crimes  and Jekyll as the good one for living a respectable life   even doing good now and then  However  this book is not a story about good fighting against evil  Dr  Jekyll desires to do evil  yet he will not act upon his desires so that he will not tarnish his reputation  So his evil heart found a way to work out these desires by disguising himself as Mr  Hyde  Although Hyde commits the atrocities  he is only acting upon what Jekyll already wants to do  In fact  Jekyll is  more evil  than Hyde  because Jekyll is the one who creates Hyde as a means of committing evil without consequences  The Bible tells us that no righteous person exits  Even when man does something good on his own it is equivalent to dirty  filthy rags  Dr  Jekyll evidences this truth  as he would often do good deeds   even correcting the evil done by himself in the form of Mr  Hyde  This story clearly presents the sinfulness of man Stevenson s presentation of man s sin makes us acutely aware of our need for the gospel  Literature allows the reader not only to have a mental knowledge of man s sin  but also to be emotionally moved against sin  When we read of the horrific crimes committed by Hyde  we feel anger towards both him and Dr  Jekyll  So what is the solution  What do we need to combat this sinful nature that pervades men s hearts  We need the Gospel  God does not convict of sin without giving us the solution  In his book  How The Gospel Brings Us All The Way Home  Derek Thomas wrote  when God reveals sin He is calling us to repentance   When God makes us aware of the evil in our hearts  He wants us to call upon the promise offered to us in 1 John that  if we confess our sin  He is faithful and just to forgive our sin and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness  This story allows us to see our need for the gospel  Finally  this book helps us understand our need for community  As Mary Shelley explores what it means to be human in the popular story of Frankenstein  she points out that humans desire relationships  No matter what provisions a person has  or how wealthy a person is  human companionship is essential  The more recent Harry Potter stories make the same observation early on in the series by portraying Harry  although wealthy beyond his imagination  as sad and lonely on his first Christmas at Hogwarts because his friends have their families to celebrate with them  and he does not  Humans  at a basic level  desire community and companionship  More importantly  Christians understand that becoming a child of God also brings them into the family of God  God uses other believers to aid in the pursuit of holiness of other family members  Sinclair Ferguson reminds us that  our fellowship with other Christians is one of the chief instruments God has given us to overcome sin   We are not made to live on our own  separated from other believers  During Dr  Jekyll s worst moments he cut himself off from every relationship  minimizing any accountability in his life  Hebrews 10 24 exhorts believers to consider those around them   to take interest in the lives of our fellow believers  God uses other people to help us in our pursuits of holiness  Stevenson shows that man at a basic level desires companionship  and that believers ought to pursue Christian community  Stevenson teaches us about man s sinfulness  our need for the gospel  and the necessity of community in this short book  Although there is much to be learned from this story  these are the main points that stood out to me  I would highly recommend this book and hope that you will enjoy it as much as I did   Another classic that I have never read  I was surprised at how short this book is  Not really a  novel   more like a long short story  The beauty of this story is that we get the events from the perspective of a lawyer  Mr  Utterson   even though it s in third person  Then  at the end  we get the whole story from the perspective of Dr  Jekyll  himself  Oddly  all of the representations that I have ever seen of this story  even the Bugs Bunny parody  really don t quite do it justice  Hyde wasn t necessarily an ugly monster  as most people have depicted him  He was  rather  the embodiment of the evil that lives within each of us  I think  in some ways  this is a moral tale  Good vs  evil  and how  if we give it a foot in the door  evil will take over  Incidentally  I did not like the afteward by Jerome Charyn in the Bantam Classic edition  I find it very pretentious when people presume to tell me what the author really meant  Reminds me of school lit classes  which I also hated  Someday  I would like to write a novel that becomes famous and sit in on a lit class  so I can tell the teacher how wrong he she is about what I was writing about  Pft  The analogy of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde has probably been used by people since the story was published but I wonder how many people have actually read the book  I had never read it before and found it to be an interesting study of human nature  Jekyll tries to release the evil nature in himself without any guilt  His personal struggles are no different than the struggle against sin inside of everyone as St Paul describes on Romans  Jekyll s loss of control over his evil self brings him down  St Paul concludes   What a wretched man I am   For the Christian there is victory over sin in Christ  Thanks be to God who gives us the victory in Christ Jesus our Lord  As with so many of the older classics  we think we know the plots and characters from word of mouth or  God forbid  the film versions of the stories In the past few months  I ve read FRANKENSTEIN  DRACULA and now  THE STRANGE CASE OF DR  JEKYLL AND MR  HYDE Each one was had so much more depth and value and was more beautifully enhanced by brilliant writing than I would have imagined Robert Louis Stevenson s youth was bound by poor health that required frequent periods of isolation and bed rest  Perhaps the very fact that his life was so confined freed his imagination to give birth to the characters in his stories JEKYLL AND HYDE is a study of good versus evil   a common plot in all literature   but the insight he gives you into the minds of these dual beings is the beauty of the book that no other source of telling can portray with any justice or satisfaction  Amazing  Very strange  and very different  If I hadn t known the story beforehand  it would have been quite a good mystery for me   Although  I must admit  I m not all that engaged when it comes to deciphering mysteries  I found it a little silly how everyone was so incredibly repulsed by Mr Hyde  it just seemed a little irrational  But I m nearing the end  though  and it s all coming clear now  It s a great read  I love it  Recommended to all those who enjoy dry fiction and fantasic wordplay  Post script  The MARVEL character known as the Incredible Hulk was supposedly inspired by this novel as well as Frankenstein by Mary Shelley  Considering my knowledge on these topics  I can certainly see why   knt hdhh hy ltjrb  l wl  ly m  styfnswn   lrwy  knt mn trjm  l bqry  Hmd khld twfyq    jmy

hacia muy monotono  como muy plano pero el ultimom capitulo es sencillamente una obra maestra y con el cobra sentido todo el libro   Es increible todo lo que cuenta y lo que transmite en tan poquitas paginas  es el tipico libro que se lee en un dia Sin duda yo creo que este libro tiene una gran dosis de verdad aunque muchos de nosotros nos empenenemos en negarlo y supongo que habra sorprendido mucho en aquella epoca  Sin duda un clasico que hay que leer si o si  yo tuve la suerte de que no sabia nada de la historia pero aunque la conozcas merece mucho la pena   I VE ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS Stevenson is an author that has always captivated me  and so he has done with this magnificent short novel  There you go  Rob  you are the real MVP        Como todo el mundo lo estaba leyendo tambien quise hacer lo mismo  y fue una buena eleccion   Me gusto muchisimo  Nunca dejan de sorprenderme los clasicos  Uno tiene las ideas tan preconcebidas que no se da cuenta de lo que se esta perdiendo entre las explicaciones y las historias basadas en el original  Por eso los clasicos son de obligada lectura para conocer la realidad del concepto y no el producto del marketing  Jekyll y Hide la dualidad entre el bien y el mal entre el poder de crear y destruir a voluntad  la necesidad de autoafirmarse escondiendose de la realidad sin esperar las consecuencias de los propios actos o actos ajenos vividos en propia carne  Encontrar ese pasadizo secreto que te permite ocultarte y disfruta de una nueva realidad para saciar tus sentidos y ser no lo que esperan de ti sino lo que realmente alberga tu verdadera personalidad esa que ni en privado eres capaz de vislumbrar porque el ser humano no es un bien o un mal sino un conjunto de sensaciones eticas o prohibidas que nos obligan a controlar Una historia que te sorprendera y te hara pensar en lo que tu escondes en tu interior  con el peligro de ser devorado por la propia bestia que tu has mimado y alimentado  siempre subyacente  Los clasicos nunca defraudan  After seeing so many classic film adaptations of this book  I figured it was about time I read it  Since I already knew what it was about  I can t say I was surprised at the end  However  it is a great read  Certainly an original for its time and I think it should be a celebrated piece of horror fiction still  My favorite part would have to be Dr  Jekyll s take on everything that had happen  It was a good character study  looking into what he was feeling and what he was struggling with internally  I think I may reread this around Halloween time along with Sleepy Hallow because it is such a classic that it has to be retold  In a way  the concept is still relevant even in realistic terms  Everyday people live their lives a certain way  Then people get tired of a certain lifestyle and opt for a new one because its so different from what you are use to  This is why I enjoyed this story so much  It explores deep rooted moral  emotional  and I guess physical conflict in a person that go along with that idea  I  m rambling but hopefully you get what I mean Overall  it is a good story  Though I wasn t surprised by the twist  which we all know what it is   the idea is still captivating  Again  very original for its time too   More like 4 5 stars but I m feeling charitable so I ll round up This is another book where I was familiar with the basics but parts of the story surprised me  The story is not told by Jekyll or Hyde but by Dr  Jekyll s friend Mr  Utterson  Utterson is alarmed by some changes in his friend s habits but basically just goes about life as normal  as I probably would when a friend is going through a crisis that I don t know anything about  Utterson notices that Dr  Jekyll has become friends with a loathsome man named Hyde  that Hyde has complete access to Jekyll s home and possessions  and that Hyde has inexplicably been named the beneficiary in Jekyll s will if anything were to happen to Jekyll   or if Jekyll were to mysteriously disappear We don t get to find out what s actually going on until the end of the book  If I knew nothing about the story I probably would have been mystified and deliciously frightened  But because the story is so famous and I knew exactly what was happening  I could concentrate on the masterful language and storytelling Perfect Halloween read  I ll admit I skipped the essay at the end which was meant to explain the book for me  Honestly  do these people think we re idiots  What s with the introductions and  afterwords  for famous novels   You hear all the time he she has a Dr  Jekyll Mr  Hyde personality  It s funny after having read the story  I have a totally new respect for Jekyll Hyde  Was Dr  Jekyll insane  Let s see  he was a scientist who liked to experiment  which is what any scientist worth his salt would do  He also believed that every human was more than just one  self  but several personalities in one  Jekyll believed there was a way to bring out all sides to the human being  while still keeping the original host  the essence of one s soul  Actually  that s not insanity but sheer brilliance because he s right  Every person has several sides  The problem was once Jekyll discovered the correct potion to test his theory  he didn t factor in that something could go horribly wrong  For every cause there is an effect  and that was Jekyll s error  Once Mr  Hyde began to shape of his former self  Hyde represented all that was evil and sinister within Jekyll  He took all that bad and lived the bad boy life  And what was even more thrilling than that  while Jekyll lay dormant while Hyde took over  Jekyll enjoyed what Hyde did  He liked living dangerously and murderously because it gave him power When the potion began to take on a whole personality of its own  Jekyll soon discovered he would change whenever his body felt like it without his knowledge  See  that s another thing the good doctor didn t factor in  He thought his personality would only change  but the potion caused the personality to mold into a completely different looking person  which is amazing because that part of the experiment actually rang true  If you have different sides  certainly all those sides will not look the same  He d go to bed as Jekyll only to wake up as Hyde  And Hyde was horrifyingly disfigured and a small shell of a man  unlike the bigger than life Dr  Jekyll who was a very tall and lean man  Unfortunately  Dr  Jekyll failed to realize his experiment didn t quite go deep enough  The only sides Jekyll had was his good side  being the doctor  and his evil side being Mr  Hyde  He had nothing else and this brought about a deep struggle within himself and threw him into a deep depression I found this story so captivating and gave me much more insight into the mind of what most called a mad man  but after having read and deeply reviewed  I m not so sure he was as everyone suggested  What he ultimately learned of himself drove him to insanity when he realized he couldn t forego being Mr  Hyde no more than he could being Dr  Jekyll  He actually created monsters  He had a great idea  but unfortunately  didn t think it all the way through  If he could have controlled Mr  Hyde  I suppose this story would have had a different ending  Outstanding read  I absolutely loved this book  Honestly  this was amazing  I don t understand how you could dislike this book  However  after completing it  I felt somewhat saddened that I couldn t have read The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde with a clean slate and having absolutely no idea about anything in the story  Unfortunately  that was not the case at all  I knew the general idea that Jekyll and Hyde were one  However  I did not know anything about the plot  So that was a bonus The plot was not incredibly complex  however it was pretty intricate  I absolutely loved it  I enjoyed the entire cast in the story  particularly Utterson  He was so simple and trustworthy  very contrary to Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde The ending actually surprised me  My jaw actually dropped and I had to read it twice so I could get the full understanding of it  After my second time through  I felt deep rooted sympathy for Dr  Jekyll and that his scientific discoveries lead to such suffering  But  what needed to be done was done  Overall  amazing book  Loved it   mfz    km hy mfz   fkr  lqS

this long to read  I Personally love that Stevenson addressed both the good and evil that reside in our species  I speak often of the dark side that lives within us and how we so often pretend it is not there or cover it up  it s taboo to speak of the hell that lives in all of us  Everyday we awake  and as a decent human we try to do what is right and proper but in our minds our thoughts go opposite of our actions  Example  driving on the blvd today saw a pig  person  throw a plastic bottle out of the window onto the street while approaching a red light  I immediately thought about how satisfying it would be to get out  pick up the bottle  shatter his window and make him Choke on the bottle while asking him if the earth is his trashcan  That was my Hyde that lives in me but I kept my Jekyll and did nothing like a good little controlled Citizen  I would have went to jail for helping the planet fight its parasites  Ok so anyway I Absolutely love the novella and its writing style  I totally get the duality of man thing  we all live it  everyday  When I think of book I d like to hand to an alien species to understand humanity I d like to give them this here masterpiece  If your wondering   should I read this   The answer is an overwhelming YES  In this classic tale  The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  Stevenson has recreated London back to the past where there is a doctor named Harry Jekyll and a very strange man named Mr  Hyde  The main character Mr  Utterson who is Dr  Jekyll s lawyer trying to find out who is this  Mr  Edward Hyde  character in Dr  Jekyll s will  He also has heard the name  Mr  Hyde  moving around London because Hyde has trampled a little girl walking in the street on night  Being one of Dr  Jekyll s closest friends he demands to find answers to who Mr  Hyde is and why Dr  Jekyll is giving him everything he owns when he dies  The thing that I liked about this book was that it was a classic which are my personal favorite genre next to superhero comics  Classics to me are the best because it allows the reader to see what life was sort of like back then where most of the action took place in London due to the fact that most of the authors wrote in British  Stevenson he made London sound like a dark mysterious place to be in throughout the story due to it mostly setting at night time  In the story through Mr  Utterson s point of view  he seems like he is desperate to know what Dr  Jekyll is hiding from him in his will  He goes to all the possible people who might know why Mr  Hyde is in Dr  Jekyll s will  But having the story be from Mr  Utterson s perspective was a bad idea  in my opinion  because he is so desperate that he will stop at nothing to get what he wants  Also Jekyll gave Utterson his will a long time ago and decides to investigate now which is still odd to me after reading it I enjoyed this book because it had a lot of mystery involved in it and it really keeps you wondering  how is Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde related   I would recommend this book to anyone who really enjoys classic novels  Robert Louis Stevenson is one of my favorite authors  He can be a little hard to understand at times  I had heard of this story before  I did not decide to read it until some time ago  In the beginning of the story Mr  Enfield and Mr  Utterson are taking a walk  Mr  Enfield takes notice of a door that reminds him of a horrible event committed by Mr  Hyde  Later Mr  Utterson finds out that Dr Jekyll would turn his estate over to the one and only Mr  Hyde if something happened to him  Mr  Utterson becomes intrigued and wants discover the truth of the strange happening  Dr  Jekyll refuses to relay any important information at that given point in time Mr  Utterson is a lawyer who is investigating to find out the truth  He appears to have a sense of loyalty to his friend s wishes  Dr  Jekyll is a friend of Mr  Utterson  He is a rather respected doctor and seems to have a lot of money  Mr  Poole is Dr  Jekyll s butler  He is loyal and has worked for the doctor for twenty years  He very is concerned for the welfare of Dr  Jekyll  Dr  Lanyon is a friend of Dr  Jekyll  Something happens later that causes him to wish never to hear of his now former friend  Dr  Jekyll again  Mr  Enfield is a friend and a distant cousin to Mr  Utterson  The two of them often take long walks together  Mr  Hyde is spoken of as being deformed and giving those around him a sense of a presence of evil  Not only does he appear evil but he is evil The setting takes place in the the late nineteenth century in London  England  This may fit because people at that time believed in strange ideas The main theme of this story is the good and evil in oneself  I find an example of this in Dr  Jekyll  His experiments show both sides of him  the good and the evil I would recommend this story to teens and adults who love mysteries  The story can be very hard to understand   knt wl qS  qrh mn slsl  ldb l lmy llnshy yn lty

questo piccolo capolavoro e stato davvero un piacere  Bella la struttura narrativa  la suspence  le atmosfere opache  per non parlare poi della descrizione dello sdoppiamento del dottor Jekyll in mr Hyde     nascondere  che fa parte dell immaginario di ogni lettore occidentale   A well written creeper  Also a brilliant critique of the human condition and the scientific quest to perfect it  Henry

book that I re read every decade or so  I would love to write something this iconic  How can such a short book  66 pages in the edition I loaned from the library  get you so spell bound  Simply marvellous  The way Stevenson writes is just   there are no words  Wow  A very good novel  describing the dual nature of a man s existence  of  outward respectability and inward lust as they say  A classic and a must read  Surprisingly quick read   haven t read this in awhile   and a nice tight  brisk cautionary tale  Of course  a classic for a reason     ry    mn rwy   styfnswn bl mn rwy   ldb

asked me   Who was the bad one  Jekyll or Hyde   I could not answer  because I did not know  That is when I decided to read two classics a year  and Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde would be my second one  I am so glad my hubby asked  because  I don t know if I would have ever thought to read it Stevenson s story really makes you think  where they really two different people  was Jekyll an addict and this was how he felt when he was on drugs  was this a case of multiple personality  or  did the doctor have a  God complex  and when he had any evil thoughts  had to compartmentalize them into another being Loved it and would highly recommend it to all Critica publicada originalmente en  http   makingofezine com 2015 08 20 e    EN AQUEL TIEMPO  MI VIRTUD ADORMECIA A MI MALDAD  QUE SU PROPIA AMBICION MANTENIA DESPIERTA Y ESTABA AL ACECHO Y PRONTA PARA APROVECHAR LA OCASION  Y LO QUE AFLORABA ERA EDWARD HYDE  DE AQUI QUE  SI BIEN TENIA YO AHORA DOS CARACTERES  ASI COMO DOS APARIENCIAS  UNO ERA PURA MALDAD Y EL OTRO SEGUIA SIENDO EL ANTIGUO HENRY JEKYLL  AQUELLA MEZCLA INCONGRUENTE DE CUYA REFORMA Y MEJORA ESTABA CANSADO  LA TENDENCIA ERA  PUES  CLARAMENTE HACIA PEOR    De esta manera describe el doctor Jekyll su tormento en la ultima carta donde confiesa su pecado  una monstruosidad que ha traspasado los anos desde que se viera publicada por primera vez en 1886 y se convirtiese en un secreto ya conocido por cada uno de nosotros  pero pocas veces expresado en voz alta  los seres humanos tenemos monstruos y son reales  como los fantasmas  viven en nuestro interior y  a veces  ellos vencen  como diria el celebre escritor Stephen King  El extrano caso del doctor Jekyll y mister Hyde es una de esas novelas cortas que marcan un hito y crean una base en torno a la cual giran docenas y docenas de historias  pero aqui esta la indudable base que merece ser descubierta de primera mano por el lector  pese a las notables adaptaciones que han habido en el teatro  el cine  la primera es de 1912  y hay otras conocidas como Mary Reilly  a cargo de Stephen Frears   el comic  The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen de Alan Moore y Kevin O Neill  o la inspiracion que esta vigente en personajes tan populares como Hulk El escritor Robert Louis Stevenson  un genio que fue una llama que crepito veloz en vez de consumirse lentamente  encontro en esta obra de misterio  que se dice que fue fruto de una pesadilla  un tema fundamental para el espiritu malogrado del ser humano  su dualidad entre el bien y el mal   Que somos   Buenos o malos   Podria la ciencia albergar una pocion capaz de separar el lado malo del bueno  crear a un monstruo que destruir para que nosotros permanezcamos puros y sin macula  Si somos santos y destruimos un demonio   seguiremos siendo dignos de la gracia del cielo o por el acto de matar pasaremos a ser siervos de Mefistofeles tambien  Y si separasemos el mal de nosotros   seguiriamos siendo nosotros lo que quedase  acaso   Y si la bestia venciera en este juicio final que afrontamos cada dia En El extrano caso del doctor Jekyll y mister Hyde  la division en el ser humano se remarca en las decisiones de los personajes donde el bien y el mal se confunden en un digno debate  en el que el doctor Jekyll se convierte en el espejo de todos nosotros  podemos ser honorables y decentes  pero quizas solo lo seamos por cobardia y no por convencimiento  Tal vez elegimos ofrecer nuestra mano al projimo en vez de apalearlo porque tememos las consecuencias de nuestros actos y no por nuestra moralidad  Si fueramos libres de pecar  de hundirnos en las tinieblas tremulas de nuestros sentidos   lo hariamos  Si escapasemos del castigo  la mala fama y los remordimientos   apaleariamos a alguien   Robariamos   Nos dariamos al exceso como fieles herederos de Baco   Somos buenos porque queremos serlos o lo somos porque tememos lo que podriamos ser si fueramos villanos   En que lugar nos deja eso  cuando somos bondadosos solo por temor y no por nuestra verdadera naturaleza   Nos ocurre a todos  Docenas y docenas de preguntas  como ven  que llegan a cualquier lector que emprende este misterio a medianoche y donde cada uno elige las respuestas A traves de sus capitulos  donde nos hallamos con algunas muestras epistolares  Robert Louis Stevenson nos conduce por las desventuras del abogado Utterson en busca de saber porque el apocado doctor Jekyll  que siempre ha tenido fama de buen hombre  quiere dejar sus bienes a un ser extravagante y mezquino como el enigmatico mister Hyde   Que lleva a un angel a proteger a un diablo Y el lector tambien lo descubre  aunque ya todos conozcamos el desenlace  porque los spoilers en la historia de la literatura ya son parte del todo  como el destino de Romeo y Julieta  el destino de Ahab o el culpable de Estudio en escarlata   pero no podemos renunciar a uno de los primeros libros donde surgio de forma clara el caracter disociativo de la personalidad  adelantandose a investigadores en los campos de la mente como el mismisimo Sigmund Freud Si valoramos El extrano caso del doctor Jekyll y mister Hyde incluso con un caracter desmitificador o posmodernista   cabria la deconstruccion    la descripcion de la pocima  a partir de sales  bien podria recordarnos por sus efectos sobre el doctor Jekyll a la cocaina y mas con la dependencia que crea hacia su terrible mejunje  Pero al final  ya sea la droga  el alcohol  el sexo  el arte    Cualquier placer puede generar a una bestia a partir del hedonismo y pronto el truco de Jekyll para ensuciarse las manos como Hyde  pierde el control cuando es Edward Hyde el que comienza a tomar posesion de su alma cuando asi lo desea Y progresivamente el heroe que pudo ser Jekyll se descubre como un ser temeroso de su propia naturaleza  incapaz de ser el angel que siempre quiso ser y nunca fue  porque ha pecado al jugar a ser Dios y desear ser perfecto  y el lado malvado de su ser ya no encuentra ese limite en la moral del lado bueno  Y el mal siempre gana en esos duelos A todo esto  y si nos centramos mas en otros aspectos literarios  anadimos que la novela bien podria pertenecer a la noble tradicion de la literatura gotica  con ese Londres plagado de calles difuminadas por el misterio neblinoso y esas descripciones del amanecer y el anochecer con una calidad poetica que ya desearian muchos  y que hermanan con la exteriorizacion de los sentimientos en el aspecto del tiempo y el paisaje que manejasen los autores del romanticismo  Por citados motivos  la prosa de Stevenson es irremediablemente celebre gracias a aportaciones como esta novela u otros clasicos como La flecha negra o La isla del tesoro Queda volver pues al autor  Enfermo durante gran parte de su corta vida  Stevenson hallo en sus suenos una forma de retratar a la perfeccion al ser humano y El extrano caso del doctor Jekyll y mister Hyde es  sin discusion alguna  una obra digna de ser leida  porque a veces es importante recordar que todos albergamos monstruos y fantasmas en los aticos del alma  pero tambien demonios capaces de vencer en nuestro corazon y como pocion solo nos queda la esperanza y la buena literatura  Tomemos un buen sorbo y emborrachemonos con ella  Y SI SOY EL MAYOR DE LOS PECADORES  SOY TAMBIEN LA MAYOR DE LAS VICTIMAS    What starts as a little Sunday walk in cold London and a simple conversation on a house soon becomes a story of horror and secrets  We follow the lawyer and good friend of Dr  Jekyll while he tries to find out what kind of relationship the latter has with the evil Mr  Hyde  He tries to save his friend from something he does not yet understand The perfect mixture of a simply amazing writing style  creepiness and mystery  Stevenson combines a discussion on the destructible way of drugs brilliantly with the union of good and evil in us  The only thing I would have wished for was the book to be not that short  Me ENCANTA  la trama es excelente  Me gustaria que hubiese mas libros asi  Human nature prefers good  but always attracted to evil http   grooveshark com s Mr Hyde 4dPr    This is one of those classics where you know the story and yet you don t quite know the story  I was drawn in from the first page by Stevenson s alluring writing and decided to power through it in one sitting  The tale makes a very interesting psychological statement  leaving the reader with a slightly Freudian perspective of human nature  This is one those that gets the proverbial cogs whirring  and the reader inevitably slips into thoughts of how human beings perceive others as well as themselves in this strange universe   or maybe that s just me  This book was probably the first classic story I read outside of  the great illustrated classics  series as a kid  of course  I read the illustrated version first    I as a kid I was a bit intimidated by the style of writing  A lot of it is told through letters  or the POV of Dr Jekyll s really clueless friend who s name I can t remember  And that guy was so dumb he couldn t pick up on what was going on until Jekyll freakin spells it out for him at the end I remember thinking Jekyll could have really handled the situation better by  like  asking for help  Today I can t help but see it as a reflection of the stigma of mental illness in that day  Dr Jekyll and Bertha Rochester would probably have a lot to talk about   not that they were alive at the same time anyway  but they re both fake so anything could happen    It makes me wonder if Jekyll would have faired better had he been a man of the current era   I d like to think so  if Bruce Banner is any indication    I also really liked how he s this really respectable doctor and genuinely decient person as an adult  but back in the day  as a teenager  he had to deal with some stuff  And it turns out all of it is still inside him and   spoiler alert   his brain uses it to make an alternate personality   end spoiler   Weirdly enough  it makes me think of young adult missionaries  Note  I noticed this book wasn t on my goodreads shelf after watching this video https   m youtube com watch v GShoezs   It makes me a bit sad that NOWHERE in the book do Jekyll and Hyde converse in a gloriously  dark duet     EDIT  7 17 15  OK I ve changed my mind  this book is absolutely perfect exactly as it is  I ve lost count of how many times I ve listened to this book  but there is so much in here that s symbolic  and each time I notice something new  As an allegory  its an expertly crafted story  Utterson  Enfeild  Jekyll and Lanyon are joining Harry  Bilbo  Sherlock  Katniss and Alf of Fae on my list of all time favorite fake people  Old rating 3 5  New rating 5 5   La mejor historia de horror jamas escrita  Al menos yo no he leido una mejor  La brevedad con la que Stevenson construye la historia de Jekyll y Hyde contrasta con su extraordinaria complejidad narrativa  La pericia de Stevenson es descomunal  en apenas un par de parrafos es capaz de comprimir una asombrosa cantidad de informacion  dandose ademas el lujo de envolver dicha informacion en una horripilante atmosfera construida a partir de palabras clave y una sintesis asombrosa Minimizado su valor artistico por el conocimiento y la sobreutilizacion pop de su trama  la novela es una de esas raras joyas que apenas leidos dos parrafos el lector intuye que esta ante una obra magna  y claro  lo esta                     NOTAS PARA USO PERSONALSTORY OF THE DOOR Puede crearse suspenso mas perturbador que lo plasmado en este capitulo Un abogado cuyas amistades carecen de toda virtud y unicamente surgen del azar  Mr  Utterson   camina todos los domingos con Richard Enfield  un hombre con el que no tiene nada en comun pero cuya caminata rutinaria respeta por sobre todas las cosas Llegan a un edificio de 2 niveles sin ventanas en la planta baja y con una puerta cerrada y herida por el tiempo y el vandalismo  Nadie la ha reparado  Enfield le cuenta historia sobre un hombre  Hyde  que al toparse con una nina que corria de madrugada  trampled calmly over the child s body   gran imagen   Los gritos de la nina sacan a todos de sus casas y el atrapa a Hyde y lo confronta  Todos desarrollan asco inexplicable frente a el  Le exigen pago y va al edificio abandonado por un cheque que cobran cuando abren los bancos  El cheque esta a nombre de un ciudadano respetado  Utterson termina diciendo que conoce el nombre del ciudadano y jurando junto con Enfield no hablar mas del tema La anecdota es espeluznante  Todo esta ligeramente fuera de lugar  Describe a Hyde como un  juggernaut  inclemente que pasa sobre la nina  Luego habla de que seguro tiene una deformidad terrible pero que no la vio  tratando de justificar su asco  Fisicamente lo describe guapo   La accion genera el asco  La accion tal vez combinada con la calma del hombre que en ningun momento se resiste  Mira desafiante y apacible como se suceden los acontecimientos  Es indiferente al dolor humano pero es capaz de acoplarse al remedio monetario  Una especie de ser emocionalmente alienado Hermosisima frase de Utterson cuando R  L  Stevenson describe el caracter no juzgador del abogado   I incline to Cain s Heresy    I let my brother go to the devil in his own way  SEARCH FOR MR  HYDEUtterson vuelve a casa y se pone a estudiar el testamento del Dr  Jekyll  es su abogado y nos enteramos que Jekyll es quien firma los cheques de Hyde   En el testamento se especifica que en caso de muerte o  desaparicion  todo pasa a manos de Hyde Utterson va a ver a Lanyon  colega de Jekyll para preguntarle sobre Hyde y no lo conoce Utterson decide pasar dias frente al edificio de dos niveles abandonado donde el testimonio de su amigo dijo haber visto a Hyde  Finalmente lo ve y el encuentro es  como en el capitulo anterior  profundamente trivial pero al mismo tiempo grotesco y escabroso   Hyde le da su direccion  a street number in Soho   como si supiera que tiene que saber el abogado donde encontrarlo y luego le dice que como lo reconocio   By description   was the reply Whose description   We have common friends    said Mr  utterson Common friends   Echoed Mr Hyde  a little hoarsely   who are they   Jekyll  for instance  said the lawyer He never told you  cried Mr Hyde  with flush of anger   I did not think you would have lied  Come   said mr Utterson   that is not fitting language The other snarled aloud in a savage laugh  and the next moment  with extraordinary quickness  he had unlocked the door and disappeared into the house Maravilloso  El ritmo de ese dialogo y la incomoda conclusion generan una atmosfera perversa y absolutamente misantropa  asocial Utterson va a la casa de Jekyll que esta cerca y el mayordomo le dice que el Dr  No esta Se lamenta de la suerte de su amigo y sospecha que el testamento es culpa de una deuda de juventud no pagada DR JEKYLL WAS QUITE AT EASEUtterson hace una cena con invitados y al final se queda solo con Jekyll  Saca el tema del testamento y el doctor le pide que respete su deseo privado  Jekyll es alto guapo y en sus cincuentas  contrastante con Hyde que es enjuto  pequeno y joven Jekyll le hace prometer a Utterson que cuidara del joven Hyde en caso de que deje de existir THE CAREW MURDER CASEUna sirvienta presencia el asesinato de Carew  cliente de Utterson a manos de Hyde  De nuevo adjetivos bestiales   And the next moment  with ape like fury  he was trampling his victim under foot  Carew llevaba sobre para Utterson  Este identifica el cadaver y al ver el baston roto  arma letal  que le regalo el mismo a Jekyll  y escuchar la descripcion del hombre identifica a Hyde  Se ofrece a llevar al policia a su casa  Soho   Hermosa descripcion del viaje entre la niebla y la llegada al barrio sucio y lugubre de Hyde  Abre una ama de llaves que dice que no habia visto a Hyde en meses hasta ese dia  Entran a su cuarto y Hyde se llevo todo y quemo chequera  Casa frugal pero con buenos vinos y lo poco que hay amueblado es con lujo  Esperan atraparlo cuando vaya al banco  pero nadie sabe quien es y las descripciones varian  salvo en el asco que genera a todos por igual INCIDENT OF THE LETTERLa carta que llevaba Carew a Utterson no parece tener mayor proposito que el de que la policia lo contactara para identificar el cadaver  No se le da seguimiento Utterson va a ver a Jekyll  Ya escucho las noticias y le dice que odia a Hyde y que nunca lo volvera a ver  Le ensena carta en la que Hyde dice que se escondera y no volvera  Utterson queda tranquilo hasta que al salir le pregunta al mayordomo por las facciones del que entrego la carta y este le dice que no llego nada ese dia fuera de lo habitual  Utterson consulta a Guest  empleado suyo de confianza sobre la carta  Y justo entonces llega invitacion a cenar de Jekyll y Guest compara las dos cartas porque le parece una letra profundamente similar  La sospecha de que la carta fue escrita por Jekyll se magnifica REMARKABLE INCIDENT OF DR  LANYONSe pone recompensa por Hyde y este desaparece de la faz de la tierra  Jekyll retoma la buena salud y el animo  Pero tras una cena se vuelve a recluir y a negarle la visita a Utterson  Este va a ver a Lanyon despues de unos dias y lo encuentra casi moribundo  Aterrorizado  Le cuenta Utterson que Jekyll esta mal otra vez y  I wish to see or hear no more of Dr Jekyll   Lanyon muere y le deja sobre a Utterson  not to be opened till the death or dissapearance of Dr  Henry Jekyll   INCIDENT AT THE WINDOWDos paginas de puro terror  Stevenson es un maestro en generar atmosferas horrendas y en este caso este capitulo entra por completo en la tradicion de la cuartilla perfecta Utterson y Enfield van en su paseo dominical y pasan por el laboratorio de Jekyll  Deciden espiar por la ventana y lo ven  Jekyll comienza a platicar amenamente sin dejarlos pasar desde la ventana y de repente cuando accede a seguir platicando a distancia   But the words were hardly uttered  before the smile was struck out of his face and succeeded by an expression of such abject terror and despair  as froze the very blood of the two gentlemen below  They saw it for a glimpse  for the window was instantly thrust down    Stevenson maneja mucho el alargamiento del tiempo  La escena toma dos segundos pero la pausada y detallada descripcion alarga el evento y luego  al establecer la brevedad del mismo  potencia el horror del lector que ya con todo el detalle en mente imagina el horror con la violencia de lo subito Aterrador y magistral  Utterson y Enfield se alejan en silencio igualmente aterrados THE LAST NIGHTPoole  el mayordomo  llega a casa de Utterson y le dice que esta preocupado por su jefe Jekyll  Utterson lo acompana a la casa  Los sirvientes  aterrados  han dejado sus puestos y estan en el pasillo esperando  Poole lo lleva al gabinete y le pide a Utterson que no haga ruido y solo escuche  Poole anuncia a Utterson y le responde una voz tras la puerta  que no es la de Jekyll  negando entrada Salen y Poole le cuenta que el y los sirvientes creen que han matado a Jekyll y ahi esta aun su asesino  Le cuenta la obsesion de Jekyll por encontrar un quimico en estado puro y su fracaso para conseguirlo  Finalmente deciden entrar y con un hacha abren el gabinete  Dentro encuentran muerto a Hyde con una ampolleta en la mano  y en los papeles un testamento que cambia a Hyde como beneficiario y le deja todo a Utterson  Hay tambien documento de Jekyll con toda la historia  pero le ruega que lea primero el testimonio que Lanyon le dejo en el sobre Capitulo extraordinariamente dinamico  Perturbadora narracion de cuando Poole ve a Jekyll rebuscando fuera del gabinete y al verlo sale corriendo como una bestia  wearing a mask   Casi convertido en Hyde  o totalmente convertido   El cadaver de Hyde usa la ropa de Jekyll  que le queda extraordinariamente grande Poole recuerda a la bestia llorando en las noches Creeepy as fuck DR LANYON S NARRATIVEEl documento que escribe Lanyon narra como recibe una carta de Jekyll  diciendole que es urgente que vaya a su gabinete con un cerrajero  Entre y tome los contenidos de un cajon y se los de a un enviado suyo a medianoche  Lo piensa loco pero obedece y a medianoche aparece Hyde  Recoge el contenido  Prepara una bebida y le ofrece revelarle el secreto  Lanyon acepta y Hyde bebe para transformarse en Jekyll  El shock arruina la vida de Lanyon  Y como sabemos termina matandolo HENRY JEKYLL S FULL STATEMENT OF THE CASELa revelacion de Jekyll  que ata finalmente todos los cabos sueltos de la novela es maravillosa  Inicialmente una justificacion sobre los intentos de Jekyll por entender la dualidad bondad maldad dentro del ser humano y liberarlo de la eterna convivencia de ambas  liberando a uno de los dos arquetipos mediante una pocion  Luego vienen los problemas cuando le cuesta trabajo llegar a Hyde pero despues Hyde comienza a aparecer sin la pocion  tomando el control gradualmente con mayor intensidad  hasta que Jekyll debe tomar la pocion cada vez con mas frecuencia para volver a ser el mismo  Episodio terrible en que Jekyll se transforma en Hyde en un parque y como esta siendo buscado por la policia por el asesinato escribe la carta a Lanyon  Brillante aproximacion tambien a la mente del adicto  y al proceso fallido de Jekyll para dejar la droga  Es un capitulo y una conclusion absolutamente increible  que finaliza con Jekyll declarando que no encuentra ya la sal con la impureza necesaria para transformarse y que Hyde va a tomar el control  Este parrafo sobre el miedo de Hyde a que Jekyll se suicide  asesinandolo  es maravilloso  But his love for life is wonderful  I go further  I  who sicken and freeze at the mere thought of him  when I recall the abjection and passion of this attachment  and when I know how he fears my power to cut him off by suicide  I find it in my heart to pity him  Stevenson es un enorme escritor  Esta novela es jodidamente perfecta  Por cierto  Stevenson es aqui gran precursor del body horror  By far my fastest read ever  in about 2 hours and 15 minutes  This book from the beginning to the ending had me in an an odd  dark sense of engagement  more like a morbid curiosity not about the story itself but of man s and mine own dual natures torn between civilisation and liberty  often in an unhealthy  imperfect balance  Robert Louis Stevenson has written with deft  remarkable skill  each word springing naturally from another like thoughts based upon thoughts and so on  He has cleverly explored the many different natures and dispositions of man  of repression  restrictions of society  and how we often choose to cage our demons but when they break out  and they will  they do so with a tremendous roar that leaves us in despair and tragedy  Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde are two extremely likable characters  and the lawyer Utterson  the narrator  is not too bad himself  observing the two with a flair for wit and irony  The other supporting characters  particularly Dr  Lanyon add a lot to the story  which also reminded me of my own two good friends altogether forming the Trio as we are called  Excellent writing 10 10 This novella was beautifully written and it was very easy to imagine those dark streets and alleys and the Victorian setting  I don t know why  but I loved the character of Mr  Utterson a lawyer  and also he was the one who narrated the story and I think he was a reliable narrator The idea of this book was simple here Stevenson  tells us how good and bad co exist in all of us And   How it would be if we could separate both good and bad    Like be an entirely good person or entirely bad person So basically throughout the book there was a whole lot of suspense and mystery which kept on building up and was actually unfolded in the last two chapters  which I really enjoyed  Yes  I felt that in the beginning the story was a bit slow paced but then it also hold my interest from the first page  which was actually good Though I really wanted the ending to be more tragic and sad  but this too was good and I recommend this book to everyone  not just the mystery or suspense lovers So  just read it  if you haven t yet  Sono rimasta del tutto estasiata dalla scrittura di Stevenson  non e mai noioso  non e mai troppo descrittivo  non e mai eccessivamente contorto  L ho trovato semplice  scorrevole e pur conoscendo il finale  mi ha tenuto con il fiato sospeso fino alla fine  Perche il Dr  Jekyll si comporta cosi  Cosa sfugge all avvocato Utterson  E Poole  che ruolo ha all interno della storia Stevenson risponde lentamente a tutte le domande e in piu analizza il concetto del doppio  che a mio parere e un analisi che porta l uomo a riflettere su se stesso  Il libro e ambientato in un periodo complesso della storia l eta vittoriana in cui tutto cio che e fuori dall ordinario deve essere nascosto  altrimenti  un medico importante come il Dr  Jekyll non riuscirebbe a mantenere il suo nome rispettabile  A questo punto fa il suo ingresso Hyde  chi e Hyde  Stevenson lo descrive come un uomo di piccola statura  gracile poco sviluppato  con una camminata strana e anomala  Hyde rappresenta tutto quello che il Dottore vorrebbe essere  un uomo che non ha paura di essere giudicato dal mondo esterno  ma che vive di piaceri  agisce senza scupoli solo per il piacere personale  Jekyll e il suo opposto  e solo coscienza  si preoccupa degli altri  si preoccupa di se stesso e dei suoi amici come potra mai essere felice la sua vita se porta dietro di se un fardello che non gli permette di essere se stesso  ma solo chi gli altri vedono  Quello che il Dr  Jekyll cerca di spiegare e che ogni uomo ha un duplice aspetto  quello che lo rende felice e quello che e costretto a mostrare  ma come scelgliere quale parte interpretare  Jekyll vuole essere la parte migliore di se  ma e cosi semplice  E se quella peggiore prendesse il sopravvento  Stevenson e stato capace di rendere il filo sottile che lega questi due aspetti ancora piu sottile  Mi e piaciuto il suo modo quasi soprannaturale di spiegare il difficile passaggio da una parte all altra  Vorrei andare avanti ma credo che inserirei qualche spoiler  percio mi fermo qui e non posso fare altro che consigliarvi assolutamente questa lettura http   leggereunmododivolaresenzali b     I read this book in college as part of a Literature   Film course that used horror fiction as a lens to view the history of film  It was a very fun course  and most of the works  both literary and cinematic  have stayed with me  But when I picked up this short novel to read to my wife over several nights  I found that I remembered practically nothing of it There are many ways to tell this story badly and uninterestingly  but Robert Louis Stevenson has instead created a powerful and insightful novel in a few short scenes  While the writing is certainly of its time  and as such a little challenging at first  it is really very beautiful  There were many lines I was stopped by and went back to re read just to take pleasure in what was said and how it was said But the thing that made this story survive the last 125 years is the accuracy of the psychology of Dr  Jeckyll and the richness of Mr  Hyde  The narrative ends with Dr  Jeckyll s own account of what happened to him  and in it  Stevenson creates such a full portrait of addiction and hidden desires that compel us to indulge in activities that we know are both shunned by society and not healthy for us  He accurately describes the desire for the taboo  the rush of exhilaration and freedom when the taboo is first seized  the equal rush attained when the activity is successfully concealed  and the panic the ensues when the activity is further indulged in and begins to get out of hand  The swearing off of the activity  the pleasure one takes in oneself when one succeeds at being pure again  and the siren call that eventually lures one back in  all richly and beautifully described  Whether you have done anything yourself of this nature  the psychological reality of it all cannot help but ring true  You feel for and understand Dr  Jeckyll and his desire to shake off the respectability he had shackled his life too even as he wishes to maintain that respectability and all the cultural bonuses that go with it  He wants to have his cake and eat it to  and for a while he can have both before he learns that ultimately he will have neither Mr  Hyde is no less engrossing that Dr  Jeckyll  While Hyde s  evilness  is characterized again and again in the eyes of Utterson and finally in the eyes of Dr  Jeckyll  Hyde never seems so one dimensional to me  He is simultaneously repulsive and attractive  both a terror and an underdog  someone you must condemn but must also pity  as Dr  Jeckyll eventually admits to It is usually rewarding to return to the source of stories that have become part of the cultural landscape we live in  The basic story of Dr  Jeckyll and Mr  Hyde is known to everyone  but it is more than the simple notion that we all have good and evil in us that originally raised Stevenson s story from the general literary noise into the national subconscious  It is Stevenson s excellent writing and insight into humanity that originally thrust his novel into the limelight  and it is that excellent writing and insight into humanity that should bring you back to the original text  This was a fantastic book  with incredible insight into the human condition  Hyde was one of the most terrifying characters I have ever seen laid forth on the pages of book  terrifying precisely because he lurks underneath the skin of every man  woman  and child who walks this earth As I read this book I continued to hope that Stevenson would eventually lead Jeckyll to the point where Hyde would come out without the aid of his concoction  and of course as the book concludes that is exactly what we find happening  Had that not occurred the book could have remained simply an impersonal mystery  yet to see the final transformations of Jeckyll into Hyde as involuntary actions was to see the true nature of evil lurking within the human nature  To read this book without taking a good hard look at oneself is to not read this book at all  To see what horror we would be if our own depravity was given full license is to see Mr  Hyde in our own mirror  Perhaps the most frightening reality this book exposes is that our own Hyde rears it s head often  and like Jeckyll we find something almost addictive and tantalizing about bringing him forth This book does a great job of expressing the shame we have over the evil that resides in us  yet all to painfully shows our unwillingness  or better yet  our inability to dispose of that evil altogether Excellent story  highly recommended    Rating  5 of 5What can be said about a classic such as The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  A story so well known  one that has permeated our culture so completely  perhaps rivaled only by Frankenstein and Dracula   most everyone knows the gist without ever having read the novella or watched a film adaption  I daresay  little  if anything new  or at the very least   fresh   Thus I will stick to my personal reaction in this review From a writer s perspective  I applaud  and appreciate  the structure and narrative style  Stevenson built upon  and relied on  the reader s natural curiosity and desire to solve the mystery of Mr  Hyde  to know what was  really  happening  which probably made this quite the sensational page turner during its initial publication in 1886  I read the story much slower than I do with most modern fiction  there s much to savor and digest for those patient enough to nibble  One of the story s less subtle themes   repression of one s curiosity and not asking questions that  shouldn t  be asked   was ingenious  wasn t it  Given the tools Stevenson utilized to engage readers  OH  And the descriptions throughout the story often knocked me for a loop they were so     distinct  Stevenson knew exactly what images he wanted to conjure up in readers  minds I will definitely give this one a re read whenever I want a refresher in  1  allegory and  2  the characterization and theme of duality and hypocrisy Disclaimer  If you are bored or confused by complex sentences  extended paragraphs  and or Victorian Era prose  then The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde probably won t float your boat  I wasn t sure what to really expect with this one  Yes  it s a classic that  everyone knows about   but I didn t really know what it was about going into reading it  I knew there was a Doctor who turns himself into Mr  Hyde  pure evil   I didn t really know the specifics or anything about other characters or story line in general I have a somewhat ignorance with a good amount of classic books  I know them  I know enough to want to read them  but I don t peruse them further until I read them  This helps give me a fresh reaction to the story So my reaction to this story was great overall  Like many classics I actually listened to the audiobook version  librivox org is GREAT for this and my budget  because it helps me read them at a good pace and makes it easier for me to pay attention  I just can t read some of the writing sometimes no matter how beautiful  Ok  back to the review  haha  It was a great story with a mystery and a great moral dilemma about good and evil  I won t really get into much more though  I know it s short and I m not saying really anything at all  But I really like Stevenson s writing and the horror added into the mystery of what s going on  I ve read Treasure Island only from him  so this is number 2 I ve read  I ll have to now go and read more of him since I m enjoying it   Con motivo de Halloween elegi esta novela  razonablemente corta  para pasar la noche de difuntos  Una de esas noches donde todo el mundo parece disfrutar con el horror en general que repudian el resto del ano No la leia desde que tenia 12 anos  y la verdad es que apenas la recordaba  Aunque todos asociamos el titulo a la idea de Jekyll Hyde y la pocima  la estructura es muy diferente a lo que podria pensarse Aunque la ambientacion es propia de una novela de terror  y la premisa podria entrar dentro de la ciencia ficcion  la novela esta escrita como si fuese una historia de misterio  Solo en los dos ultimos capitulos se destapa toda la terrible historia que da titulo al libro  hasta entonces todo lo que uno lee son las investigaciones por parte de un pomposo abogado  preocupado por su cliente  el senor Jekyll No es una novela con un gran numero de personajes  pero todos tienen una gran importancia en el desarrollo  Cambiando de punto de vista segun lo requiere cada situacion Algo que me ha sorprendido  porque no lo recordaba bien  es la cantidad de pequenos detalles que se plantean al comienzo de la novela  y como son perfectamente clarificados en su parte final  Por ejemplo  cuando el abogado pregunta claramente si el senor Hyde tiene la llave para abrir una puerta por la que suele entrar  es un detalle nimio pero que se revela de gran importancia  Posiblemente sea esta una de las novelas que mas claramente trata sobre el lado oscuro latente en cada ser humano  dispuesto a tomar el control en los momentos mas propicios  Porque el propio doctor reconoce que ese lado suyo siempre ha estado ahi  desde que era joven  y que si lo mantenia soterrado era por su posicion social  En realidad  es un personaje que disfruta abiertamente entregandose a las mayores perversiones posibles  y es Hyde el que le permite hacerlo  Hyde es desagradable  porque representa ese lado salvaje y animal del ser humano  que todas las personas tratan de ocultar  de negar  Si hay algo que siempre me ha fascinado de esta historia  y de  Olalla   del mismo autor  que he descubierto hace muy poco  es esa representacion de los seres humanos como entidades debatiendose entre su lado animal y su lado humano  Por supuesto  para que el lado animal muera  debe morir tambien el humano Imprescindible  es quedarse corto    The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde  by Robert Louis Stevenson was very interesting book to read  I already had an idea of how the story went  but that didn t stop me from being interested in the book  This book was a bit difficult to read because of the old english writing  I often found myself re reading parts of the book that I didn t quite understand  The story starts off with the main character Mr  Utterson  and Enfield  Enfield speaks of a brute of a man named Mr  Hyde  who trampled a young girl  They find out later that a good friend of theirs Dr  Jekyll has Mr  Hyde included in his will  Mr  Utterson knows this because he is a lawyer and Jekyll is one of his clients and friends  Mr Utterson has a conversation with Mr Hyde and is surprised at how odd he looks  A year later someone named Sir Danvers  who is one of Mr Utterson s clients is murdered at night  Mr  Hyde is nowhere to be found and Jekyll says that all connections between him and Mr  Hyde have ended  Mr  Utterson is at home one day when Dr  Jekyll s butler  Poole comes to his door worried about Jekyll  Dr  Jekyll has locked himself in his lab for hours  When they arrive they decide to break into his lab and find the body of Mr  Hyde in Dr Jekyll s clothes  In this room Mr  Utterson finds a note from Jekyll  that will explain everything that has happened   This story is told from the first person view of Mr  Utterson  Mr Utterson is a wealthy lawyer who is good friends with the major characters in this story  He has to watch his client Sir Danvers  and his friend Dr  Lanyon die  This makes his interest in trying to figure out what s happening very realistic  Utterson is very concerned with Dr  Jekyll s well being not only because he is Jekyll s lawyer  but also his friend  Mr  Utterson is easily my favorite character in this book  The Setting takes place in the late 19th century London  In the book  the streets are constantly described as being eerie or quiet  Robert Louis Stevenson does a good job of describing the mood of the streets and other places mentioned in the book  The biggest and most noticeable theme is good vs  evil  Dr  Jekyll is at first happy with his transformation  but then can t stop the transformation from happening  It eventually takes him over and Mr  Hyde kills someone  Jekyll does everything in his power to try and stop the transformation  Although this book was hard to read I enjoyed it very much  I want to read more books of this genre  I wouldn t recommend this book to anyone not yet in high school  I would recommend it to high schoolers and young adults who like the challenge of a more difficult book  En el siglo XIX  en Londres  un abogado investiga la identidad de Mr  Hyde  un personaje oscuro que levanta muchos murmullos  Por la misteriosa relacion que presenta con el Dr  Jekyll  el abogado Utterson se entusiasma aun mas  Cuando Mr  Hyde asesina a Sir Danvers Carew  el abogado sospecha que el Dr  Jekyll puede estar involucrado e incluso encubriendo al asesino Al morir Lanyon  amigo de Utterson  la trama se acelera  El Dr  Jekyll se encierra en su laboratorio  y es el mayordomo Poole  quien debera pedir ayuda al abogado para investigar quien fue el desconocido que asesino al Doctor  Cuando entran en el laboratorio  su sorpresa es mayor  cuando encuentran a Mr  Hyde muerto  Sin embargo  el Dr  Jekyll no esta Al final  es en unas cartas donde se esconde la verdad  El abogado Utterson lee en la carta de su amigo que Lanyon fue testigo de como Hyde y Jekyll eran la misma persona  pero que se transformaban fisicamente cuando bebian una pocion que el mismo Doctor habia inventado  En la segunda carta descubre la confesion del Dr  Jekyll  en donde analiza el bien y el mal que cada uno de nosotros lleva dentro  hablando de la lucha interna que continuamente se realiza  Con el fin de separar estas dos esencias  habia creado la pocion y su antidoto Cuando tomo la pocion  el cuerpo del Doctor tomaba un aspecto desagradable  pero aumentaba su fuerza y su inteligencia  asi como su maldad  ese ser era Hyde  A medida que pasaba el tiempo  los efectos de la pocion eran mas duraderos  el Dr  Jeckyll estaba perdiendo el control de su cuerpo  y cuando asesino a Sir Carew  intento dejar de convertirse en ese ser malvado  Sin embargo  la intensidad de Hyde era tan grande  que aun sin beber la pocion  el Doctor se veia transformado de repente  Debiendo usar el antidoto continuamente para mantenerse en control  uno de los ingredientes para elaborarlo se le agoto  Al comprender que estaria condenado a ser la maldad encarnada en Hyde para siempre  el Dr  Jeckyll tomo la decision de quitarse la vida Mucho antes de que el psicoanalista Freud publicara sus trabajos sobre el yo y el ello  Stevenson habia analizado ese cuestionamiento  dando un nuevo significado a la novela victoriana  Las descripciones de la ciudad y de las costumbre hipocritas son  en todo momento  un gran aporte al argumento  que ya de por si resulta atrayente  Duality is the word often used to describe this book  as a study of personality and the battle for supremacy over the impulses of good and evil  It happens that the one side of the doctor is repressed by means of a very potent substance  which also transfigures him physiologically  If evil had a face  then Mr Hyde nicely represents it in appearance  The dour yet kindly doctor represents by contrast the goodly persona  alive with care of his fellow creatures  The really interesting thing to me is whether or not Hyde represents the more powerful of the two persona s   Hyde is certainly referred to as being of a younger and physically stronger type than his antithesis  but the latter is  for a time  able to keep him under control before succumbing to the foul depredations of Hyde  Evil in the end is destroyed by the very vessel which it requires  the human body  As such  the story proceeds from the key revelation from Jekyll that he became convinced that man consists in a  primitive duality   each side of which constantly vying for supremacy  directing the body to do each or the others  bidding  But the separation of identities  it transpires  must involve the extirpation of the one to give full freedom to the other  This is the experiment Jekyll undertakes  with success and dire consequences This used to be my favourite book   time has changed that situation  but it remains as brilliant as ever  Dr  Jekyll und Mr  Hyde ist ein Klassiker des Horror Genres  Die Novelle des schottischen Schriftstellers Robert Louis Stevenson  1850 1894  erschien 1886  Sie erzahlt die Geschichte des Arztes Dr  Jekyll der  um sich der Gesellschaft besser anpassen zu konnen und tagsuber besser zu funktionieren  seinem triebhaften Ich mittels Medikamenten die Gestalt des Mr  Hyde verleiht  Aber Hyde gewinnt immer mehr die Oberhand Diese Geschichte ist viel mehr als nur eine Horrorgeschichte  sie ist deutlich vielschichtiger und funktioniert auf verschiedenen Ebenen  Zum einen ist da die offensichtliche Horrorgeschichte eines Arztes  der sich immer wieder in ein menschliches Monster verwandelt  Dann ist da jedoch noch die Warnung  nicht seinen Trieben nachzugeben und ihnen freien Lauf zu lassen  weil sie sonst irgendwann die Kontrolle uber einen gewinnen konnten und einen so vernichten  Und nicht zuletzt auch die Warnung vor Drogenmissbrauch  denn Jekyll wird mittels Drogen zu Mr  Hyde  diese Droge  damals richtete das Opium viele Menschen zugrunde  totet Dr  Jekyll und ubrig bleibt der triebgesteuerte Mr  Hyde Hyde ist der Antiheld in den Jekyll sich verwandelt ganz anders als die modernen Helden  die sich in gute  strahlende Helden verwandeln  in dieser Hinsicht ist diese Geschichte deutlich kreativer als viele der heutigen Verwandlungsgeschichten Ein wunderbarer Klassiker  der wie gewohnt von Titania Medien sehr werksgetreu umgesetzt wurde  Alle Sprecher sind wie immer Vollprofis  keine der Rollen  nicht einmal die Nebenrollen sind mit unangenehm auffallenden Anfangern besetzt  Die akustische Umsetzung ist auch wie gewohnt sehr realistisch  sparsam und unterstutzend erzahlerisch eingesetzt  Leider war der letzte Track   Dr  Lanyones Bericht  mit fast 18 Minuten extrem lang  da ware es sicherlich besser gewesen ihn in 2 3 Tracks aufzuspalten Auch wenn die Geschichte bekannt ist und man von vorne herein weiss wie es ausgeht  dennoch ein absoluter Horgenuss und eine sehr gelungene Umsetzung   This is a fabulous recording  It is somewhat abridged  though I haven t yet worked out quite where the abridgements come  John Sessions  the reader  is amazing  and it is altogether a fascinating piece of story telling  to which Sessions  in my opinion  does full justice I want to review it as a book    and I m reading that currently in various formats  starting with Kindle and moving on to various print versions  so I shan t say too much here  But if you want to hear a master of prose construction and well paced narrative  Robert Louis Stevenson is your man  And this is  after all  one of the novels that unexpectedly generated mythic characters  like Frankenstein and Dracula I love the structure of this  It starts with a mysterious closed door    and that becomes a central emblem  Dr Jekyll s secret is behind that door  but it acquires intrigue as the novella goes on  stepped up bit by bit  As Utterson  the lawyer through whose eyes we see most of the story  becomes more and more curious  but also more determined to respect the honour of his friend by NOT opening sealed letters etc  the suspense builds  There are literal and metaphorical doors  behind which there is yet another level of discovery  and another    until the very last door is opened  And if you think you know what s behind the last door  because you almost certainly DO know the kernel of the Jekyll and Hyde story   you don t  Not really  There are all sorts of unexplained secrets  What did Mr Hyde really get up to on his nights out in London  Why did Dr Lanyon die of       shock       when he heard Jekyll s confession  Good lord    what kind of man WAS Dr J  Utterson says he was  wild  when he was young       What sort of  wild  did that careful euphemism cover I love the way Utterson drinks gin   to mortify a taste for vintage   And loves the theatre but hasn t been to a play for twenty years  Pleasure   sin  Virtue   stifling all the things you really enjoy  Oh dearie me And  if you happen to know the book well  remember the night Mr Hyde trampled over the little girl    and later that same night sat with her parents and Enfield  I think I ve remembered his name right  until the banks opened in the morning and the cheque signed by Jekyll could be cashed    what on earth did they talk about  Strange case  It most certainly is that  I thought I would read the book after seeing a local production of the musical Jekyll   Hyde   which  by the way  has an entirely different and more involved story  In the original story  the readers follow Mr  Utterson as he investigates deeper into the mysteries surrounding his friend Dr  Jekyll  For such a short novella  Robert Louis Stevenson builds suspense quickly and intensely  The character of Hyde are less extreme than you would find in film or stage adaptations  but somehow more chilling and gleefully evil   view spoiler  I didn t expect Hyde to have a strong element of fear or self preservation  though   hide spoiler   You don t really get to know Dr  Henry Jekyll  who  strangely enough  is called Harry on several occasions  until the second half of the novel  but that s totally okay with me  it s a mystery suspense story  anyway  I really enjoy themes of duality  and of course  this book is chock full of them Thrilling tale and a great classic story  Just one word  Amazing Stevenson just knows how to weave a story and his wirtingstyle is beautiful I usually have to start classics at least twice before I get used to the writing but this book just grabbed me and didn t let go until I was finished My only regret is  that I would have liked to be able to go into this book knowing nothing  It says a lot tath this book manages to be this good  even though the big mystery is already revealed Genius  THE STRANGE CASE OF DR  JEKYLL AND MR  HYDE  first published in 1886  is still one of the most popular horror classics  Robert Louis Stevenson originally wrote the story in three days after being haunted by nightmares of living two lives  by day  an esteemed  well known doctor  by night  a gruesome  brutal man who kills victims purely for fun  Stevenson s wife read the draft and became so upset that he burned the manuscript  He would write a new draft in the next three days If you haven t already read this tale of murder and split personality  it is highly recommended  While most people are familiar with the chilling  good vs  evil premise of this story  the gore and creepy details keep the reader anxiously anticipating the plot s next revelation  And this novella can easily be read in just one day  some versions are under 100 pages   THE STRANGE CASE OF DR  JEKYLL AND MR  HYDE is definitely a 5 star must for any reader  I actually really liked this book  Of course I knew the story line way beforehand  and I expected a three star  nice but not really my type of story  read  I m not sure why I even thought that  because I love novels like Journey to the Center of the Earth and other Science Fiction of that era  maybe it was the monster thing   I might just have really liked it because it was the first book I d read after reading quite a bit of Shakespeare and Le Morte d Arthur and it just felt good to be into some more modern English  but I think I would have liked it anyway  so I ll give it the benefit of a doubt If you want you can delve into all the worldview thoughts  which in a novel like this is very easy and probably useful to do  and it would be a great study  Or you could just enjoy a good book for the sake of a book There s really not much to say about it  actually  It s a classic  it s short  you should read it   O medico e o monstro  e uma historia de horror  mas que traz em sua essencia reflexoes muito interessantes  sobretudo acerca da natureza humana  A escrita de Stevenson e muito gostosa e a leitura fluiu muito bem  me proporcionando diversao acima de tudo  O autor me deixou extremamente curiosa conforme a historia se desenrolava  apos cada cena escabrosa ou passagem misteriosa  E eu ate ja conhecia o segredo desse livro  mas nada estragou a experiencia da leitura  Achei um livro genial     Wow   this book is literally the best classic novel I ve ever read  Possibly because it doesn t revolve around romance    Anyways  I really  really enjoyed the whole split personality angst stuff going on  Which makes me sound a little corrupted  but Stevenson s writing is so great that I could feel all of the tension in everybody  Utterson about unraveling the case of Jekyll and Hyde  Jekyll about everything spiraling out of control  Hyde about basically wanting to have full power   Amazing ness  Definitely So  yes  Go read this right now  If you read it at night  in your bedroom  with the door closed  you will more than likely feel rising levels of tension and possibly panic  as I did  and you ll probably jump up and scream if a bug scratches at your window  Because   you never know   they all say Mr  Hyde died  but they could be wrong    n m df ny llbd bqr  hdhh lrwy  hw

como explicarlo  Diomio La historia es muy corta menos de 100 paginas  pero es muy filosofica en cuanto a al bien y el mal que hay en cada individuo  Muy recomendable   I came away from this book with a lot to think about which to me is a sign of a great book  It is a story line I thought I knew   After all I had seen the Bugs Bunny episode      I was quite happily surprised at finding that the plot actually went a lot deeper than I thought  It brought up lots of issues that are relevant today like addictions  actions and consequences  and the good verses evil we each face with in ourselves  What happens when people put on a facade and then live a different life behind the scenes  I thought it was kind of interesting how clear cut right and wrong seemed to them back then  Comparatively we live so much more in the grey now  Which might be why I thought the headlines of Mr  Hyde would fit right in with today s news    Edward Hyde in goruntusune burundugumde insanlarin korku duymadan yanima gelemeyeceklerini gozlemlemistim  Bence bunun nedeni  butun insanlarin iyilikle kotulugun bir karisimindan meydana gelmis olmalariydi  oysa Edward Hyde  insanlarin arasinda tek basina gezinen ve icinde sadece kotuluk barindiran bir mahluktu   If you think you know the story  yet have never read it  you don t know the story  Even if you ve seen any of the various movies  you still don t know the story  The movies are so completely different from the book that it s not even the same story any more  The book is 96 pages and free to read  it s in the public domain   Do yourself a favor and read it  If you are gonna read any classic  read this one This is the perfect novella  in size and plot The characters leap off the pages and the story is one we all think we know but don t truly until we have read the original version Wonderful   This is a good  short read about how twisted drug addiction can get   in the sense of supernatural  because one man can change to another   I highly disagreed with the fact his wife thought it was the worst of his work  Ahora se de la procedencia de la famosa Pocion Hydy que aparecia en diversos dibujos animados o peliculas  Recordare a Hyde y Jekyll en esas personas que suelen cambiar tanto de personalidad un momento a otro  Muy fresa lectura   What a great book  I m so glad that I read this  and I can t believe it took me so long to get to it because I have wanted to read it for quite some time  As I read it  it made me think of Agatha Christie s And Then There Were None  I think the two authors  writing styles are similar   It s a great and thinking novelI had enjoyed when I read it  I like the order of events and how the writer displays the characters  I was shocked in some parts also I like the friendship between Utterson  Jekyll and Laynon  How they support and protects each other in several and hard situations During I read  I was wondering what the relate between Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde     but at the end I respect Jekyll determined and sympathize with him  Also  I have the same believe about the people have two sides or more  Sometimes the good side rises and other time the bad one shows  By the way  the sin starts with pleasure and ends with sorrowfully  That way we must be careful about our desires  It is impressive how much R L Stevenson packed into this short novel  Lots of creepy atmosphere  well developed characters and a suspense filled plot  All this is delivered with beautifully sophisticated vocabulary  A true good read  lqS  tnqsh lTby   lmzdwj  llbshr  lSr  byn lkhyr wlshr dkhl kl nsn

such as how everyone knows the name Frankenstein and Dracula  Stepping into this book  I knew the basic outline of it  and I feel this prevents people from picking it up or why they claim to have read it simply because they know the basic outline or have seen the film  The book  albeit short  is brilliant and I would highly recommend picking it up  Don t settle with the outline  flesh it out  colour it in with the utter gloom that pervades through Stevenson s prose  Each sentence sweats out the Gothic and it exhales true horror  tackling man s inner savagery and dark desires   Gunumuz romanlarindan sonra tahmin edilebilir bir kurgusu olsa bile hem pek cok esere ilham vermesi acisindan hem de cok saglam psikolojik alt yapisiyla okunmasi gereken bir hikaye Let s cue the slow clap to honour Penguin for revealing the crux of the plot in the summary on the back cover  So thanks to that  I predicted my way through the first nine chapters really well written  nonetheless   missing the shock Stevenson obviously designed for me to realize  But  THAT  LAST  CHAPTER  The analysis of character and portrayal of complexity and conflict were just so deftly executed that if I had a highlighter  I would ve honestly coloured the entire chapter  Read the first nine chapters to learn fancy and poetic ways to call someone ugly  and mostly to prep for the last chapter  Read the tenth because WOW   All things therefore seemed to point to this  that I was slowly losing hold of my original and better self  and becoming slowly incorporated    tqd n m Zm fkr lkwmk mthl lrjl l nkbwt w

creating a perfect vision in my head  There is a reason it is considered a classic   How did it take me this long to read this  In both the sense that it took me over a week to finish and that i never tried to read it before  jeez    If you like weird books this is perfect  The rest of this long review is at Msg2theMing   The city is being terrorized by a gruesome  monstrous man known as Mr  Hyde  He looks unsettling  he s insolent  he ran over a child  and even murdered a man  He might have done far more for all we know  It s no surprise though  not when you look at him  What is far more surprising is his friendship with the respectful and kind man  Dr  Jekyll  Even worse than that  it seems that Mr  Hyde has the keys to his house    Me encanto esta historia   Recomendada al 100   una lectura que no se arrepentiran  Soooo chilling  A really astonishing work  particularly for its day  A classic and a great read  This book made me a huge Stevenson fan  I totally loved this book  I recommend it with all my heart   blame it on VIXX s Hyde music video  and concept they brought this book on my reading list  I regret nothing  All human beings  as we meet them  are commingled out of good and evil  and Edward Hyde  alone  in the ranks of mankind  was pure evil    Un increible relato que no puedes parar de leer La historia es muy buena y facilde leer  La lucha entre el bien y el mal siempre ha venido desde mucho tiempo  pero la gente nos conoce como somos  pero no como ambos lados de nuestra vida  Lo que justamente hace Henry Jekyll  se transforma en su lado malo  Edward Hyde  Sabemos que siempre el bien debe ser mas fuerte que el mal  Etkileyici ve insanla ilgili cok seyi sorgulatan  rahatsiz eden bir kitap  Edebi derinlikten cok  konu sarsici  Absolutely brilliant  Easy to read  amazing plot and really captivating  This should really be read by everyone  even if one doesn t like classics   I try to confine my choice of books to those that are a   a classic  b   interesting  c   teach an eternal truth or d   short enough that if they aren t any of the above  I can still finish it without wasting too much time  Seldom do I find a book that possesses all four of these qualities  In fact  I could probably name them all right now  Old Man and the Sea  The Pearl  and Of Mice   Men  Nice to read something as psychological and dark as Crime   Punishment while also being short enough to read in a single sitting  Great work of fiction  This was a very mysterious book and interesting  Never read this book and like Shelly s Frankenstein I was totally blown away by how different it was from my preconceived thoughts on the story  Stevenson is incredible  speaking into human nature that affected people in his time and still affects people in our time today  C e chi conserva scheletri nell armadio e chi le ombre le vive quotidianamente  ma c e anche chi narra dell impossibilita di separare il bene dal male  il nostro io piu oscuro dalla maschera che facciamo brillare alla luce del sole Di quest ultima branca fa senz altro parte Robert Louis Stevenson  scozzese nato nel 1850  il cui carattere ribelle si riversa nelle vicende che ha trattato su carta Il suo  Lo strano caso del Dott  Jekyll e Mr  Hyde  e forse il suo romanzo piu noto  originalissimo nel suo genere  crea nel lettore una tensione spasmodica che non accenna ad affievolirsi finche non viene voltata l ultima pagina  E forse neanche allora Sin dalla giovinezza il Dott  Jekyll avverte particolarmente viva nel proprio animo l ostilita tra il bene e il male  un dualismo accanito che lo sfinisce e lo porta a creare una pozione capace di  spezzare  letteralmente le due essenze di se stesso Cosi facendo Jekyll ritiene di aver finalmente liberato il proprio io e di aver infine ottenuto il libero arbitrio su entrambe le parti  mentre invece andra imperversando un essere da lui completamente diverso  Mr Hyde Se Hyde minaccia Jekyll di rovina e quest ultimo e ormai conscio di aver perduto il controllo  l epilogo acuisce la totale sensazione di smarrimento di chi ha vissuto da vittima e nel contempo e stato carnefice La straziante  favola  del Dott  Jekyll e di Mr Hyde e un testo evergreen che vive il disequilibrio di un esteriorita di luce apparente calpestata da un perpetuo dominio di ombre e rappresenta un capolavoro universale che attraversa i secoli dell esistenza   For I see in my members a law waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin       wretched man that I am    Romans 7 23f   I could not help but reflect on the Apostle Paul s famous passage as I finished reading Robert Louis Stevenson s  The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde   Strange case indeed  This has to be one of the more powerful morality tales  perhaps equally haunting to Oscar Wilde s  Portrait of Dorian Gray   Even though the tale bodes darkly  I had to laugh at Stevenson s occasional humor   If he be Mr  Hyde       I shall be Mr  Seek  p 14   However overall Stevenson s message is dark  unraveling near the end     reaching a crescendo with lines such as  I learned to recognize the thorough and primitive duality of man  and  I have been made to learn that the doom and burthen  burden  of our life is bound for ever on man s shoulders  and when the attempt is made to cast if off  it but returns upon us with more unfamiliar and more awful pressure   And Stevenson captures the angst of humanity when his protagonist laments being  sold a slave to my original evil   p 80   Unfortunately  there seems little hope of redemption for Dr  Jekyll  giving this story a nightmarish quality  but one that packs a punch of a message
