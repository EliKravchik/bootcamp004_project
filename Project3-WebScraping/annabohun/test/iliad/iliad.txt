What I learned from this book  in no particular order  1  Victory or defeat in ancient Greek wars is primarily the result of marital spats and or petty sibling rivalry in Zeus and Hera s dysfunctional divine household 2  Zeus  the father of gods and men  is a henpecked husband who is also partial to domestic abuse 3  If you take a pretty girl who is the daughter of a priest of Apollo as war booty and refuse to have her ransomed  Apollo will rain plague on your troops  And he won t be appeased until you return the girl and throw him a ginormous BBQ party involving hundreds of cattle at his temple 4  If an arrow or a spear were thrown at you in battle  more often than not  it would land on your nipple or thereabout  Or alternatively  it would pierce your helmet and splatter your brain 5  Paris is a proper guy s name  not just a name for capital cities or bratty heiresses 6  Brad Pitt in man skirt  Achilles is the badassest warrior there ever was 7  Real men eat red meat  specifically     a  sheep chines     b  fat goats  and    c  the long back cuts of a full grown pig  marbled with lard 8   The most valuable booty are  in no particular order       a  bronze tripods  each worth 12 oxens  and armors     b  swift war stallions  and    c  pretty women  each worth 4 oxens  if also skilled in crafts   Lesbians are particularly prized   9  There is nothing more glorious for a warrior than to sack enemy cities  plunder their wealth  kill all their men  bed their pretty women and enslave their children   10   The only men who matter are warriors  but if you are a woman  the range of roles that you could play is rather more diverse  You could be a  a runaway wife who sparks a cosmic battle between your thuggish hubby s city state and your cowardly boyfriend s  1  b  a war booty with a bad case of Stockholm Syndrome  2  c  a manipulative uber bitch  who also happens to be a goddess   3  d  a long suffering wife and mother  4   1  Helen  2  Briseis  3  Hera  4  AndromacheBut whatever role you choose to play  you will still be the bone of contention between men and the armies that they lead  All the major conflicts in the story are triggered by women  or specifically by their sexuality  Helen s elopement with Paris launched a thousand Argive ships against Troy  Agamemnon s desire to bed Briseis  Achilles  lawful prize  caused a nearly unhealable rift between them  and Hector s desire to protect his wife from the dismal fate of being an Argive sex slave inspired him to fight Achilles to the death  Homer s mortal women might be meek and mild  but his goddesses can kick ass with the best of them  and even occasionally best their male counterparts  Zeus is not above being manipulated by Hera  and Ares the God of War actually got whacked on the head by Athena   Troy  Brad Pitt  Eric Bana  Warner Bros  2004 What I find most surprising about the Iliad is the amount of graphic  X rated violence that it contains  The violence is not the biblical slaying and smiting  but something much more voyeuristically gory     the one Peneleos lanced beneath the brows  down to the eyes  roots and scooped an eyeball out     the spear cut clean through the socket  out behind the nape and backward down he sat  both hands stretched wide as Peneleos  quickly drawing his whetted sword  hacked him square in the neck and lopped his head and down on the ground it tumbled  helmet and all  But the big spear s point still stuck in the eye socket      I imagine that this kind of anatomically precise  brain splattering  gut spilling action scenes made the Iliad popular with the Romans  who routinely went to the Colosseum to watch gladiators hack each other to death  but there is only so much of it that I could take in one sitting  which is why it took me almost three months to finish it  It is not that I m particularly sensitive to fictional death and dismemberment     and after all  this book is a war book     but the sheer amount of such scenes  as well as their mind numbing repetitiveness made for tedious reading  It doesn t help that many of these deaths happened to seemingly throwaway characters  barely introduced in three or four lines  merely to be summarily  and gorily  dispatched in another half a dozen lines on the same page  The Iliad is assumed to be the written version of a much older oral poem  and such characters might represent collective memories of real Bronze Age warriors  but by Zeus  hundreds of pages of them being hacked  cleaved and skewered to death almost did me in Now  what is the purpose of such meticulously catalogued carnage  Was Homer trying to present War with all its attendant horrors to shock his audience into pacifism  Or was the old guy just trying to write an 8th century BCE equivalent of a blockbuster action adventure movie with enough gore to satisfy his young male demographic  The Iliad both celebrates and laments the warrior spirit  the haughty pride and terrible thirst for vengeance and plunder that set men to distant shores  intent on razing cities and putting its inhabitants to slaughter  but also the stark  tragic consequences of such acts  I actually find the gods  politicking and manipulations more interesting than the actual war  The Greek gods are blissfully free of any human notion of morality     which makes the problem of theodicy much more simpler to solve than in the Judeo Christian model  The Olympian gods do not move in mysterious ways  they are moved by caprice and petty grievances  Why did we suffer such an ignominious defeat  despite all that we had done to win Zeus  favor  Well  it happened that just before the battle was about to begin  Hera seduced him and subsequently put him to sleep with the help of Hypnos  whom she bribed with one of the Graces  A perfectly logical and very human explanation The story gets much more interesting in the last five books  The Olympian gods entered into the fray and the effect is sometimes like watching WWE SmackDown   Bloody Ares lunged at it now with giant lance and Athena backed away  her powerful hand heftinga boulder off the plain  black  jagged  a ton weightthat men in the old days planted there to make off plowland    Pallas hurled that boundary stone at Ares  struck his neck loosed his limbs  and down he crashed and out over seven acressprawled the enormous god and his mane dragged in the dust  Or maybe an episode of Super Friends   How do you have the gall  you shameless bitch to stand and fight me here      But since you d like a lesson in warfare  Artemis just to learn  to savor how much stronger I amwhen you engage my power     The gods are  deathless   so you know that there won t be any lasting harm from their catfight  but the cost of battle to all too mortal men is heavy indeed  This was a time when war was as elemental as they come  no mercy was shown to the enemy on the battlefield  save one that pertained to a warrior s honor  which was to be buried with full honors by his family and comrades  When mighty   stallion breaking  Hector finally succumbed to Achilles in a strangely anticlimactic duel  his father Priam went to Achilles  camp and kneeling down beside Achilles  clasped his kneesand kissed his hands  those terrible  man killing handsthat had slaughtered Priam s many sons in battle  Troy s old king begged for his son s body  and in the magnificent  poignant last book  Homer showed us the real cost of war  both on the vanquished and the triumphant  By the will of the gods  Achilles  death would soon follow  his destiny was ultimately no different from the rest of tragic humanity  fated to suffer and die by callous  immoral gods for causes that were entirely beyond their ken  So the immortals spun our lives that we  we wretched menlive on to bear such torments       w hkdh S dt rwH lmlk l  sm Trwd ttlfaWt Hwlh  tr  lmdyn  lkhld  tDTrm lnyrn fy jnbth    wtndkW SrwHh l zyz  fy lrGm    wtthw   brjh lmnyf  lty sjdt tHth

technically a poem  not a novel   and it wasn t assigned reading or anything  But for whatever reason  reading The Iliad has been on my mental to do list for a while now  and last week I finally picked it up  My first reaction  dude  this epic is epic   thank you  I ll be here all week  It s full of dudes getting killed in really exquisite detail  dudes talking about killing or not killing dudes  dudes mourning dead dudes in a totally not homoerotic way  and dudes yelling at each other about the chicks who ruin everything  The battle sequences are long and action packed  everybody is Zeus s kid or nephew  the men are men and the women are decoration  It s pretty awesome  is what I m saying  Second big reaction  I was surprised at how small the scope of this poem actually is  At the beginning  the Trojan War has already been going on for ten years  and the poem really only covers the last month or so  It s really interesting  because the poem seems to be about how the stupid actions of a few powerful people can have far reaching and horrible consequences  The whole driving force in The Iliad is this  Menelaus takes Achilles s favorite chick Briseis  who  thanks to Movies in Fifteen Minutes  will always be known as Temple Babe in my head  for his own  and Achilles throws a massive snit fit and refuses to fight in the Trojan War until the king stops raping Achilles s girlfriend and lets Achilles go back to raping her instead  Because of this  loads and loads of people die  and the gods are no help whatsoever because they re all on different sides and keep messing things up  That s the whole story  a bunch of guys who are fighting a war because of some guy stealing somebody s girlfriend all die horrible deaths because some other guys are having a fight over somebody s girlfriend  The lesson  of course  is that women ruin everything  Normally this would be cause for me to get out my Feminist Rage Hat  except for the fact that the goddesses in this story kick so much ass I can t even get that angry about how lame Helen and Briseis are   even Andromache isn t too bad  because she gets some really lovely scenes with Hector All in all  a pretty awesome  fast paced action story with enough gore and bromance to keep everybody happy  I m glad I took the time to read it   also if anyone s curious  I read the Richard Lattimore translation and found it very readable and well done  Am I really going to bother reviewing Homer s _Iliad_  I mean  what am I going to say that hasn t been said by generations of scholars  reviewers or readers  Does another drop in the ocean matter  Well  even if it doesn t I ll give it a go I guess  Reading the _Iliad_ was mostly done by me as a correction to a perceived gap in my education  I had always known bits and pieces about the poem and its heroes from various sources and the culture in general  but I had never read the poem itself  Given that it is a foundational text  perhaps  the  foundational text along with its sister epic The Odyssey  of the western canon it s a pretty big gap  Well  I did it  I found myself both compelled and  I will admit it  sometimes bored by the text  though mostly only when we came upon the epic tradition of having the lineage of each character spelled out in gruesome detail before said hero was gruesomely despatched by an enemy s spear thrust   Still  once I made it through Book II s interminable catalogue of the Achaean heroes who came to Troy along with the number of ships and men they brought with them I knew that nothing could stop me My biggest surprise was probably the way in which the heroes  all seemingly spawned by gods  are not all that unlike superheroes in a comic book  forces of raw destruction whose primary wish is for glory and the mad rush of violence and battle  And yet even these great figures pale next to the gods who play them like puppets on a string watching events unfold before them and giving a nudge here and there when the outcome for their favored side is in doubt  indeed  for me some of the most humourous moments came about when a god would unceremoniously pluck a warrior from the ground and punt him into the distance in order to keep him safe like some giant hand in a gamer s favourite RTS strategy game   It was these images and analogies  inadequate as they may seem  that kept springing to mind for me as I read of the epic battle between the Achaeans and the Trojans  It was  in that sense at least  a surprisingly modern text for me  The poem is chock full  on both sides of the conflict  of men who are larger than life  Of course the great exemplars of each side  Achilles and Hector  stand heads and shoulders above the rest  but both armies are lousy with seeming giants whose every action in battle is a superhuman carnage fest  the roll call of the Achaeans alone is impressive  wily Odysseus  prideful Agamemnon  wise Nestor  courageous Diomedes  and both the Greater and the Lesser Ajax  Of course  if you re not a hero and don t boast either a god or at least a royal personage in your near lineage  then you re really just spear fodder whose primary purpose is to allow the real fighters to show off their skill in the art of death dealing  Indeed fighting is all about the individual fighter s glory and his desire for booty   stripping the corpses is more important than pursuing a tactical advantage  Ego is all  This is a frightening vision of what a world of superheroes might look like with the lowly peons at the whim of their violence and glory seeking  The boast and the taunt are also on full display  Each hero seeks to undermine his opponent with a war of words before the spear has even left his hand  Lineages are vaunted  or disparaged  deeds are proclaimed  or ridiculed  most of all threats are made and reciprocated  Old Spidey of the glib tongue has nothing on these guys    I too could battle the deathless gods with words    it s hard with a spear  the gods are so much stronger  Not even Achilles can bring off all his boasts       Hector The violence in the poem is explicit and all pervasive  a veritable orgy of death and dismemberment  From the brains splattered inside helmets by a spear s intrusion  to the  lethal hit that s loosed  a body s  springy limbs   we are constantly presented with a panoply of violence that brings down the mists of death  a  dark  that  came whirling down across  their  eyes   upon the stricken warriors  Homer was apparently no prude and was happy to indulge his audience s apparent appetite for such scenes  The battle scenes are also truly cinematic  both in their colourful gore and in the superhuman skill displayed by the combatants  as foe after foe is handily dispatched in an almost balletic whirl of pure violence  Achilles is perhaps the most conspicuous in this  no more so than when he at last enters the fray near the end of the poem  maddened at the death of his friend Patroclus  and fells Trojans left and right  Achilles now like inhuman fire raging on through the mountain gorges splinter dry  setting ablaze big stands of timber  the wind swirling the huge fireball left and right    chaos of fire    Achilles storming on with brandished spear like a frenzied god of battle trampling all he killed and the earth ran black with blood    so as the great Achilles rampaged on  his sharp hoofed stallions trampled shields and corpses  axle under his chariot splashed with blood  blood on the handrails sweeping round the car  sprays of blood shooting up from the stallions  hoofs and churning  whirling rims    and the son of Peleus charioteering on to seize his glory  bloody filth splattering both strong arms  Achilles  invincible armsIndeed the rage of Achilles is a primal thing  The seemingly excessive violence of his comrades and their enemies prior to his entering the fray is made to seem a pale  simpering thing in comparison  Achilles is a whirl of bloodlust  hatred and retribution whose only aim is the eradication of the Trojans and their great prince Hector as payment for the death of his old friend  Despite the great power that each of these heroes displays  it is not necessarily an altogether innate function of the hero s mighty thews and prowess alone  for it is made evident throughout the text that the real perquisite for success is the blessing of a god  regardless of the native power and skill of the individual fighter  The gods seem at first content to mostly sit on the sidelines  restricting themselves to aiding and abetting their favourite hero with a nudge here and a push there until  with the advent of Achilles and his killing rage  even Zeus fears that the outcome of the battle may change and the decrees of fate may be unbalanced by a mere mortal  He then lets the gods loose and they fight for their chosen sides in a free for all that is impressive in its violence and imagery where one telling things comes immediately to the fore  the gods are much less interested in maintaining the balance of fate for the betterment of the cosmos than they are at using this excuse to fight their own grudge matches against perceived and real slights from their divine rivals  In many ways the gods are perhaps even more prevalent in the battle for Troy than are the human participants  This is fitting given the fact that a contest amongst the major goddesses  and the perceived slight of its result by the losers  were the direct antecedents to the war that would destroy a civilization  I m not sure how Paris could have judged the beauty contest between Aphrodite  Athena and Hera in a way that wouldn t have ended in bloodshed and mass genocide  but he certainly didn t try very hard once the goddess of love dangled the prospect of Menelaus  beauteous wife before him  This picking of love above worldly authority or wisdom and supremacy in war may seem like a purely pacific and even noble choice  but it often seems that even love as expressed in _The Iliad_ appears to be a fundamentally selfish thing  Helen  the human paradigm of beauty  and her divine patron Aphrodite  are both interested in  love  not as something that expresses affection or devotion to another  but rather something that glorifies the self  Helen s beauty is a great power and she uses it to glorify her own position  She deserts her husband and child for Paris and even this  love  seems to be more a reflection of her own egoism and an expression of her power over him than any sort of true affection for the son of Priam  That being said there is one set of relationships that seem to look beyond the demands of heroic culture and the vanity of the self  these are primarily seen in the quiet moments of humanity in Hector s love for his wife and child  and really for all of his family  even spoiled bratty Paris  and for Troy itself   One could also point to the love of Priam for his dead son  and the need to redeem his mutilated corpse at any cost  even unto walking into the enemy camp with only a servant and a cart full of booty   as another example of the love of others overcoming the love of self  There were a plethora of great moments in the poem  but this review is already getting overlong  so allow me to simply name the ones that immediately spring to mind  the night raid of Diomedes and Odysseus into the Trojan lines  the lone stand and battle cry of Odysseus after the Achaeans run in terror from pursuing Trojan warriors  the coming ashore of the Nereids at the bidding of Thetis to comfort Achilles  Athena s arming with the storm shield of Zeus  the gathering of the Rivers in Olympus  Hephaestus boiling a river god in his own bed in defence of Achilles  and the empowerment of Achilles before his death dealing drive amongst the Trojans to name but a few  In the end this was a greatly entertaining read that surprised me in many ways  Of course  it wasn t all dismemberment and bloody glory  there was human suffering and despair  both at the hands of the  heroes  and of the gods  and many questions raised about freewill versus one s fate  Fate seems to have the deck stacked in his favour   I was constantly surprised at little touches made by Homer  Zeus being wooed by Hera so she could distract him from aiding the Trojans  in the course of which he enumerates the allures of his former lovers as part of his seduction strategy   what a charmer    Hector deciding to leave his men to face death alone in a tight moment and the twin episode of Hector s very real fear of death  such a great fear that he actually runs away from Achilles in panic before deciding to face his fate  not exactly the inhuman hero I was expecting to see   Agamemnon showing himself to be a blustering politician  attempting to save face and excuse himself at the same time as he tries to apologize to Achilles  The fact that the poem both begins and ends in medias res may leave some modern readers a bit baffled  we enter the fray ten years after the war s inception and leave with the city of Troy still standing   but it truly is a tour de force of the poet s art  Whether Homer was one man or many  whether he composed it primarily from an amalgam of the existing tradition of epic poetic devices or it came primarily from the mind of a genius it is a work that does stand the test of time and is well worth the time of any reader  or listener  ancient or modern  So  why did I bother with  THE FREAKING ILLIAD   Thinking about it now  I can t remember what it was that made me finally pick up my giant copy that has been taking up considerable space on my bookshelf Ah  the end of that sentence kinda just answered its own question  so that is one of the reasons  It is a classic and I think almost everyone knows at least the abridged version of The Illiad  but hey ho  it doesn t compare to original  translated by this Fagles dude  text  But all in all  I can t do  THE FREAKING ILLIAD  justice with my insufficient words  so I don t think I will attempt a proper review for now  But  I can t imagine anyone wanting to read my take on it anyways since  y know    It s  THE FREAKING ILLIAD   Everyone pretty much knows all the stuff that went down right All everyone needs to know is     Achillies is one angry motherfucker with some really deep rooted mommy issues  It s pretty damn long and they have super long super badass monologues before they fight  or duel or rampage   And   pillage and attack  Full of rage    and fury    and general brutal war shit  These Trojans and Achaens are total badasses  Raiding  killing and cruel shit  Which is basically half of the  THE FREAKING ILLIAD  The other half is full of sweet things said by various characters  like   What a disaster you create  Uncontrollable Hera    you and your treachery     bla bla bla  something something     My queen    I ll whip you stroke on stroke   heheh   Homer made Zues out to be all kinky too  Okay  I didn t mean to say as much as I did  but I quite enjoyed  THE FREAKING ILLIAD   Is it appropriate to end this with  peace out   Peace out  UPDATE JAN 2013  I finished reading Stephen Mitchell s translation soon after the New Year and can t recommend it enough And  as with any good literature  I find that upon rereading the Iliad  I got something more out of it  Something that had nothing to do with my first impressions noted below  and that I ll elaborate upon more fully in my review of David Malouf s Ransom  A Novel when I finish that book  ____________________________________________Up to now  I ve only read fragments of The Iliad  First as an undergrad in various Western Civ and Greek history classes  then as a TA in grad school  for the same classes just from the other side of the podium   I even got to translate fragments in my Greek language classes  But I never had a desire to read it on my own  Three things have militated against reading it up to now  Until recently  I hadn t done a lot of poetry reading  That prejudice began to crack about 15 years ago when a former flame introduced me to Dickinson and Plath  I then read John Gardner s epic recasting of Medea  Jason and Medeia   The  block  is still pretty high but I m far more open to poetry now than in my youth A second factor in my reluctance was that The Iliad lacks any reasonably sympathetic character  Among the  heroes  there s Odysseus  perhaps  but he doesn t really get a chance to shine until Homer gives him his own epic  Even then  for me  Odysseus has always been an anti hero rather than someone to admire or emulate  Hector  too  generates some sympathy but not for anything  heroic   Rather it s his interplay with Andromache and Astyanax that makes him a real person The final impediment to reading this classic is that I already know why it s so important   why read the original when I have a wealth of analyses by men and women who ve done it for me Yet   there s always been a nagging guilt that I hadn t read it  When I saw that an audio cassette of the Fagles translation was available at the library  I decided this was a prime opportunity to assuage that guilt  after all  I had enjoyed both Gilgamesh and Beowulf much more in their audio incarnations  So  having finished it  did I learn anything  Were my perceptions and preconceptions challenged and or changed  Up to cassette 6  side A  I would have had to say  no   But then I heard a line that fundamentally altered my view of the poem and made it pertinent in a wholly unexpected way  It was the point where Homer says that Paris chose Aphrodite  as the fairest  for love  The whole poem fell into place then  and I understood what it meant to me and why Homer had written it  or had sung it  in the manner he did  After all  there s this schizophrenic attitude apparent on the author s part  Though much of the tale revolves around the  glorious  exploits of Akhaia s and Troy s greatest warriors or the machinations of the gods  there is yet a sense that Homer despises his subjects  finding worth only in those human moments when they exhibit glimpses of love  charity and compassion When I heard that line  though  I knew how to see the poem  As a cri de coeur against a world where Love seems unable to prevail against the brutality of War  Ares Athena  and the cold rationalism and realpolitik of Wisdom  Hera Athena   At that moment  I saw Paris in an utterly new light  He s still a fool but not because he chose Aphrodite so much as that he chose her without considering the consequences  Heck  in this light  I could argue that he does realize what he s doing but chose Love regardless  making him the bravest figure in the poem  it reminds me of a line from the song  You ll Never Be the Sun     You won t find that love comes easy  but that love is always right   So let this be a lesson  Works of art do not survive 3 000 years because of a fluke  They survive because they speak to audiences across time  space   culture  Perhaps not clearly  perhaps not in the way the author originally intended  but speak they do Sidebar  This version of The Iliad is not harmed by Derek Jacobi s wonderful reading  He makes the poem come vibrantly alive with a masterful command of its rhythms  characters and voices without distracting from the content   nbrd m rwf akhyls w hkhtwr mnqwsh br khwzh y qdymy  dr zyr py

a writer  it s a good exercise to understand where most literary structures come from  Homer was a great storyteller and The Iliad remains as a universal and timeless work  For me  it s undoubtedly the first  best seller  of history Spanish version La Iliada  junto con la Odisea  es sin duda uno de esos libros que todo el mundo deberia leer algun dia para comprender los pilares que sustentan la civilizacion occidental y ademas si eres escritor  es un buen ejercicio para comprender de donde provienen la mayoria de estructuras literarias que sustentan la literatura moderna  Homero era un gran contador de historias y pese a ser una obra perteneciente de un mundo antiguo  sigue siendo una obra universal y atemporal  Para mi es sin duda  el primer  best seller  de la historia y uno de mis

with a Thing For The Ladieshnd the King of Gods did make it so giving the troops of Troy and their leader  Hector  advantageonly to crush them in the end so as to increasethe glory of Achilles Who can sing the insanity of this plan  this war Should I live a thousand lifetimes  I would wither of agebefore I could recount the acts of treachery and pettinessbrought about by gods and men on the blood soaked plains of Troy Would that I had the time to list the dead and dyingthe blood and the viciousness of unholy war balanced by rare acts of humanity and kindness If only I possessed that rarest of gifts  the patienceto list the atrocities of the Gods wrought upon men Such was the gift of Homer  to do so long agowhat we cannot  weak as men are now Great Agamemnon  whose pride and stubbornness rival Father ZeusHimself  Achilles  the mighty  the hero who becomes humanonly when all that he truly loves is taken from him Hector  breaker of horses  the father and defender of a citydoomed from the outset Priam  Aged King of Troy  watching his sons die one by one The libidinous Paris  whose inability to thinkwith the right head started all of this and Helen  would that she drowned before

there are certainly villains  those immortal Gods whose every whim costs the livesof noble mortal men White armed Hera  scheming against her husbandZeus  who grants the ascendancy of Achilles at the

same as they began For  being deathless Gods  they cannot changeand what cannot change cannot learn And so the Gods  whose machinations set this tragedy in motionescape unscathed during the passage of many a mortal soulinto the dark arms of Hades And the mortals  playing parts in Zeus  puppet showdying to bring greater glory to Achilles Would that I had the time to underscore the glory of this taleand how centuries of the written word have been built upon it Give me the strength  O Gods  to tell of this cornerstone As a single oak tree  growing tall and splendid towards the sky reaching for the sun and spreading its roots into Demeter sfertile earth  put forth leaves whose numbers are unknown to manso has this epic poem inspired more works than can be countedby a writer as simple and humble as myself So reach out  dear Reader  reach out and find this tale and as a vast tank holds enough rainwater to replenishfields and fields of fecund earth  bringing forthcrops to feed people by the thousands so will you become a repository of literature and historyand be able to show the world just how utterlyutterlycool you really are Come with me  O Muse  I need a drink   I ve never been so proud to have read a book  I m checking this one off as a life goal  Look at all those shelves I can put it under  That is truly epic  I read this the first time many years ago  It s a matter of taste but I enjoyed this on many levels  historical insight and fictional adventure are only 2  This is a great epic adventure and a classic rolled into one                               Well that was my first review   pretty basic but it s correct  I read this back in high school  a prose version not actually printed in verse form  I always loved imaginative stories and still read a wide variety of genres including a healthy helping of fantasy  Here one of the most famous battles wars in history classic mythology is played out  Grand heroes  gods and goddesses dropping down onto the battle field here and there  The citizens of Olympus taking sides and the humans playing out the plans and machinations of the immortals   Lots of action  lots of banter  really  and the deities are real gossips  I mean they re really catty about each other    really  And the lesson of it all      If you re ever asked by 3 women which of them is most beautiful   say nothing  And run   run fast  run far     Ever since the beginning all have learned according to Homer    Herodian of Antioch Rage  Goddess  sing the rage of Peleus  son Achilles  murderous  doomed  that cost the Achaens countless loses Homer wanted to write down the Iliad war  but gave it a dramatic theme with Achilles rage  The story begins with the protagonist getting mad and leaving the field only to return at the end of the story  Most of the story was the narration of so many characters and their back stories and their hometowns  all while the protagonist is gone  The poem is so informative  it reminds me of Japanese Anime  Compare Anime to an american tv series  In Anime  it s so often that the characters shout out  while running from an attack  soooo much details about the situation  I mean  even the attacker announces his attack s name before performing it lol  Not to mention  that even advertisements cut screen is usually filled with lore background  Attack on Titans and Death Note for example  As for Iliad  it s common to read  John son of Doe  who comes from Towny town and his father who was a merchant  slayed Cratous the bastard son of Fratous whom his mother was a lap dancer in a trojan tavern   It s like Homer is saying  dude let me tell about this awesome story about this guy who got really mad because his king took his chick  but first let me list to you all Greek tribes and leaders   I actually loved his style  but I got bored eventually  hence four stars The poem gave the Greeks an identity  a national identity  Tho they fight among themselves they are still brethren belonging to the same civilization  That  some believe  a radical idea at the time  uniting tribes into a nation Gods  characters do not develop  because they are immortal  they lived forever and experienced a lot  Mythological characters are abstracted  The same goes to Achilles  he is the embodiment of Rage  in a sense it makes him immortal I like how the immortal gods have set of rules they can t break  they can t overcome this mystical mysterious mystery so called DESTINY and FATE  Zeus couldn t save his mortal son Sarpedon from his destined death and when gods needed to hold Achilles back not to sack Troy before its fated time   Zeus considers saving Hector  but Athena persuades him that the mortal s time has come  Zeus places Hector s and Achilles  respective fates on a golden scale  and  indeed  Hector s sinks to the ground   And when Achilles killed Hector he slept so Patroclus  ghost comes to him and say  Grim death  that death ASSIGNED from the day that I was born has spread its hateful jaws to take me down   This reminds me of Death Note where  view spoiler  the immortal Shinigamis can t prevent the death of mortals or else they die   hide spoiler  Speaking of Anime  I see parallel between Iliad s war and One Piece s Battle of Marineford  the strong captains are the ones to decide victory  it s not about who had more troops  Troops are negligible  it s all about the great warriors Gods in the Iliad are just superheroes  They do provide comic relief in middle of the long devastating epic war  Gods are just like mortals  they get mad  they get tricked and seduced by lust and sleep  they even get wounded by mortals  No wonder Plato didn t like Homer s representation of gods  Apollo to Achilles   you can t kill me  I can never die  it s not my fate    Also when Poseidon was protesting that Zeus banned them from getting their hands on the fight  he said that he is of a same godness level as Zeus and that when the three of them drew sticks or something to decide who gets Sky  Ocean  or Land of Death  Earth was decided to be a common playground for all  So  Poseidon didn t have his water powers and Zeus didn t have his thunder powers from birth  And the  not my fate to die   That makes them more humane  they suffer when they re attacked  they are sensitive and have feelings  but they don t have an expiration date      I liked the embodiment of abstract ideas common in mythology  All gods are embodiment of something  sea  sky  love  and so one  Sleep and Death are dudes  a hero s power is armor  when Hector went to see his family  his son was scared of him but when he took off his helmet the baby son stopped crying  same goes to Achilles  enchanted armor   returning home is ship  if the ships were to burn  all hope for the Greek will be lost  it will even be meaningless to win the war because they will not be able to return home  Hector stole Achilles armor by killing his friend who was wearing it  This enchanted armor was given to the immortal Achilles  mother when she was forced to wed and bed a mortal  why was she forced  I ll look it up   In return for bedding a mortal  which means her son will be a mortal   she was given this great armor that Achilles inherited from his mother  As if  by cursing her son with body mortality  in return the gods who forced her gave her an epic armor that will secure the immortality of her son  the immortality via achievement and glory  just like Gilgamesh and his great Uruk city with its great walls that he left behind as an achievement  And look at me  here I am after thousands of years after their death  writing a review about them With Hector having his magnificent armor now  Achilles needed a new one   Thetis goes to Hephaestus s mansion and begs him to make Achilles a new set of armor  Hephaestus forges a breastplate  a helmet  and an extraordinary shield embossed with the images of constellations  pastures  dancing children  and cities of men   So  not only the armor serves a practical purpose  it s a piece of art  God I would love to see it   I loved how dead bodies are sacred and how it was important to retrieve fallen allies  corpses  It gives meaning to their death  it tells warriors that it s not  game over  once your soul leaves your body  This understanding is mutual between the two sides as we can see when they agreed to cease fighting so each side can have the chance to bury and honor the fallen  Death is essential in our psychology  a part of being human  Gilgamesh epic is all about death and immortality  Same goes to religion  Abrahamic religions say it s not over when we die because there is this never ending afterlife  some Eastern Religions believe in incarnation  this life itself is never ending   For modern non religious people  Science is their religion  This longing to understand the meaning of life is deep in our psych  some find the answer in a bigger than man sacred book and some find it in bigger than man cosmological science      The father of the protagonist  just like many destined by blood heroes  is known for the characters to be great  but he doesn t show up in the story s events  Think of One Piece  Hunter X Hunter  and so on Most stories involve a relative  saving a daughter  helping a brother  etc   blood ties are very strong regardless of the culture  it s coded in our blood to protect our blood  But then  it was friendship that made Achilles  when his friend was killed by Hector  go down and fight  We see the same in Gilgamesh epic  the friendship between Gilgamesh and Enkidu  Enkidu destined death  made Gilgamesh go in a journey seeking immortality  I was just thinking   Why does it have to be the death of a dear friend  Gilgamesh for sure experienced death  death of his parents or brother  if he had one  for example   so why is it only when he witnessed the death of Enkidu that he feared his own death  I guess because a friend is of similar age and state  it s as if to Gilgamesh s subconscious  Enkidu is a copy replica mirror image of Gilgamesh thus when he saw him dying  he saw his own inevitable death Also when Priam was trying to melt Achilles heart to allow him to retrieve his son s corpse  he reminded him that he s same age as his father  So  Achilles started to pity the old man  pitted him because he would be pitting his own father  just like when Enkidu died  Gilgamesh saw his own death      More than once the narrator says something like this   the fighters in both sides were strong and proud  unlike men these days   It hints at a gap of time between the conception of the poem and its occurrence  Also when Achilles  friend came crying to him  he replied  why are you crying like a little girl grabbing her mother s skirt so she lifts her    and at the encounter between Aeneas and Achilles they started to offend each other and eventually said to each other   look at us  cursing each other here like a pair of nagging women   This gives some indication about similar society aspects that still survive today  kids needing mother attention and women gossip and WW2 veterans  as we see in movies  saying that new generations are bunch of losers lol Not to mention how the narrator emphasized the necessity of Aeneas survival  many gods worked together to save him from Achilles  so his blood line can continue  It hints at a successor nation to Troy at the time of writing the poem  Virgil s Aeneid narrates Aeneas journey that led to the establishment of Rome  Was Rome a thing when Homer wrote the Iliad  Maybe it s the other way around  Virgil saw how special Troy s Aeneas is and saw how he s fated to survive the war so he glorified him as the father of Rome Also in Aeneas and Achilles encounter  and throughout the WHOLE poem  we see how important bloodline is  Cratous son of Fratous  This is perhaps inherited in all cultures  at least to some extent  It s very clear here in Middle East  some families marry their daughters only to some families  and also in Asia  But even modern westerns have it  England for sure  and it s not strange to here an american saying  he s a Kennedy omg wow  Stan of Extra Credits says in The Power of Failure   At some times  all classical heroes have to face the fact that they are not gods  And for doing so  grow and become more human  Their failure tho isn t the failure to have in impact or even the failure of larger causes for which they fought  The Achaens win the Trojan war  Aeneas founds Rome  Prometheus brings fire to mankind  In each case their victory is universal  but their suffering is personal  and that s a key aspect to the hero  If you look at the most successful comic book writing today  they follow this formula nearly exactly  Batman  Ironman  and Professor X       History is written by the victors  Tho Homer did a great objective job in representing Trojans as proud fair people who are just like the Greeks  seeking glory in this fight  Homer glorifies War  reminds me of Nietzsche s Thus Spoke Zarathustra chapter Of Ware And Warriors that terrified me the most    imagine if Trojan writings about the war survived The famous philosophical surreal identity crisis palestinian poet felt the same  sitting in an israeli interview  you can find it in that famous videos website by searching  mHmwd drwysh km lm ytklm bd    Here s my humble simplified translation of what he said   Truth has two faces  We heard the Greek narration  And we sometimes heard the Trojan victim voice in Euripides  tongue poems  But me  I m looking for Troy s poet  because Troy didn t tell her story  And I wonder  does the people with great poets have the right to control another poetless people  And is the absence of poetry among a people  an enough cause for his defeat  Is poetry signaling denotation  or one of authorities  tools  Can a people be strong  without writing poetry  I am a son of a people not recognized enough so far  I want to speak in the name of the absent  in the name of Troy s poet  Poetical inspiration revelation might show more strongly in defeat than in victory  In defeat  there is great romance   speaking at the israeli interviewer  Do you know why we Palestinians are famous  Because you  you are our enemy  The interest in us is coming from the interest in the Jewish cause situation  So  we are so unlucky for Israel to be our enemy  because she has countless supporters in the world  Also we are so lucky that Israel is our enemy  because the Jews are the center of world s attention  For that  you defeated us  and gave us fame   reviewer  So it s like we are your Ministry of Advertising    Yes  you are our Ministry of Advertising  because the world cares for you more than us  and I have no doubts about that  Juan Goytisolo  a spanish poet   said  rough translation    The world in which we live necessitates desperately  for its subsist existence  contemplation and poets  I believe that Poetry has this powerful effect of passing down History because Poetry is easily passable  easy to memorize  amusing to recite to others whom in turn going to memorize it and recite to others  and that Poetry has a system of meters  similar to error correction codes in PCs  and that to some extent guarantees its integrity      The movie s adaptation  Troy  2004   is about Trojan War is a realistic one  no godlike Rage  no gods whatsoever  people still pray for them however The movie starts with an encounter between two armies  Agamemnon  already conquered many other greek kings  vs some other greek king  It tells us many things  Agamemnon ambition for power and to rule all Greeks  his character is one dimensioned   Achilles ambition for glory and the immortalization of his name  and his contempt of Agamemnon that seems to be related to his ambition for heroic glory  when Odysseus was convincing him to join the fight against Troy he said  The man has no honor  I won t be REMEMBERED as a tyrant s mercenary  and Odysseus replies  This war will never be forgotten  nor will the heroes who fight in it    The two armies decided to settle the fight over duel battle  a big guy vs Achilles  the strong vs the swift  a David Goliath duel battle The contempt is mutual  Agamemnon hates Achilles because he steals the show from him  Agamemnon   A great victory was won today  but that victory is not yours  Kings did not kneel to Achilles   Achilles   Perhaps the kings were too far behind to see  Soldiers won the battle   Agamemnon   History remembers kings  not soldiers    This is what made Achilles retrieve from battling  He did decided to rejoin when he learned that his friend was killed by Hector  stupidly mistaken him for Achilles  and then he finally had RAGE  character development not seen in the poem   In the poem  the story was concluded by the burial of Hector whom Achilles directed his rage at  his burial signaled the end of the story because the story was about Achilles rage  As for the movie  it ended with the Trojan Horse and the sack of Troy because the movie wasn t about rage  it was about the historical Trojan War  hence no gods  I actually pity Paris and Helen  She is stuck with an ignorant womanizing husband  Game of Thrones  Cersei   All she wanted is to be loved  and Paris provided that  he wanted too to be loved by her  they didn t want to follow their society enforced duties of marrying the hideous king in return for peace for example  Of course Homer would contempt that  It is the good ol  Romanticism  Goethe  vs Classicism  Roman s heroic values   The themes played by the director  compared to Homer s ones  are more suitable and familiar to modern audience Another theme  Fate  When Achilles decided to join the war  his mother said  I knew they would come for you  long before you were born  If you stay you ll have children and grandchildren who will remember you  but eventually they will die and your name will be lost  If you go to Troy  glory will be yours  they will write stories about your victories for thousands of years  the world will remember your name  But if you go to Troy  you ll never come home  for your glory walks hand in hand with your doom  and I shall never see you again  And there is the theme of being skeptical about gods  also familiar to modern audience and not all seen in Homer s Iliad  Hector   We can t win this war   Priam   Apollo watches over us  even Agamemnon is no match for the gods   Hector   And how many battalions does the sun god command    Priam   Do no mock the gods  When you were young you catched a fever and the healer said you would not last the night  I went down to Apollo s temple and I prayed until the sun came up and your fever had broken  I promised that day to dedicate my life to the gods  I will not break my promise   This reminds me of the Supermarket King in Fargo season one The respect of the dead is still there  After the first real battle which ended up with the Greeks retreating  honorable Hector assured them that they can safely collect the bodies to properly honor them But Hector speech to the soldiers when Greeks  ships were approaching killed it   Trojans  All my life I ve loved by a code  And the code is simple  honor the gods  love your woman  and defend you country    Code  Country  These words seem out of touch  They should ve used words like Virtue  too ethical I know  and People  At least the  love your woman  thing is so consistent with Hector s character Agamemnon  blinded by his ambition  is ever so grateful for Troy s stealing of his brother king s wife  It justifies his actions that will lead to his people s suffering  reminds me of Bush  9 11  and oil rich Iraq   He says to his consul after when his brother told him of Trojans  doing   Nothing unifies a people like a common enemy  Bush s axis of Evil   The Trojans have never been conquered  Odysseus  witty and trickery are introduced smoothly  beautifully  and efficiently in the first scene he shows up  well done Mr  Director Achilles is shockingly portrayed as an honorable hero that you wish to be like him  far from Homer s a  hole Achilles  Wait   I take that back  Achilles  men slayed the priests inside Apollo s temple outside of Troy s walls  Hector   these priests weren t armed   Achilles   Yes  There is no honor in cutting old men s throats   Hector   Only children and fools fight for honor  I fight for my country    Ah Achilles  I became a badass antihero before it was cool  o you hipster  Then of course he goes rambling about how humans will remember this war for a thousand year ugh enough of this already  Big Ajax is without his high pitched  yes he is high pitched in my head  Little Ajax  actually he s nowhere to be seen in movie    the director decided to make it how will kill more Trojans thing between Achilles and Big Ajax  the Swift vs Big  David vs Goliath  just like the first scene  and I will forever hate the director for that   Anyhow  the acting sucked and so did the soundtrack  the cut scenes montage and the focus in a character s face emotions to raise tension is primitive  I laughed so hard at Achilles  ankle close up shot and his face impressions   at least the cinematography was okay and the dialogues were good  a bit cliche sometimes  I hope by now you realized I m neither a literature critic nor a movies one  Now if you ll excuse me  I m gonna play me some God of War  D Tahukah Anda kalau di dunia ini ada dua kisah peperangan yang begitu melegenda dan abadi  Jika kita bagi dunia menjadi dua kultur  Barat dan Timur  di timur kita mengenal perang Bratayudha  sedangkan di kultur Barat kita mengenal kisah Perang Troya Jika Perang Brathayuda yang merupakan klimaks dari kisah Ramayana ditulis di India oleh Begawan Vyasa Dwaipayana pada 1500 SM  kisah perang Troya ditulis oleh Homer pada tahun 800 SM dalam dua buku karyanya yaitu The Iliad dan Oddysey  Sayangnya kedua buku itu belum mencakup seluruh kisah perang Troya yang berlangsung selama sepuluh tahun  The Iliad hanya menceritakan tahun tahun terakhir pengepungan Troya sedangkan Oddysey menceritakan pulangnya Oddyseus  pahlawan bangsa Achean  Yunani  dari penyerbuannya ke Troy  Kisah kisah lainnya tersebar dalam berbagai fragmen dan karya karya sastra Yunani kuno lainnya Asal Mula Perang TroyaKonon Perang Troya yang dipercaya terjadi pada abad ke 13 atau ke 12 SM di sekitar Dadanelles   Turki ini bermula dari persaingan para dewi di kahyangan  Sautu saat dewi Hera  Athena  dan Aphrodite bertengkar tentang siapa diantara mereka yang tercantik  Karena tak ada kesepakatan mereka meminta bantuan pada dewa Zeus  Zeus lalu menyuruh mereka bertanya pada Paris  pangeran Troy yang terkenal jujur dan adil Masing masing dewi berusaha mempengaruhi Paris agar memilih mereka sebagai yang tercantik  salah satunya yaitu Aphrodite yang menjanjikan Paris memperoleh seorang istri yang terkenal kecantikannya di dunia yaitu Helen dari Sparta  Tergiur oleh tawaran menarik Aprhrodite Paris memutuskan untuk memilih dewai Aphrodite sebagai dewai yang tercantik Singkat cerita Paris berangkat menuju Sparta dan menemui Menelaus raja Sparta   suami Helen  Ia pura pura bertamu hingga di malam harinya dengan  restu  dari dewi Aphrodite  Paris menculik Helen dan membawanya ke Troy Ketika Menelaus sadar bahwa istrinya telah diculik oleh Paris ia meminta bantuan kakaknya  Agamemnon  Raja Myceane  untuk merebut kembali istrinya  Agamemnon lalu memanggil seluruh pasukan kerajaan dan pahlawan pahlawan Yunani seperti Achiless  Ulysees  Ajax  Nestor  Patroclus bergabung menyerbu Troy untuk merebut kembali Helen  Baginya ini bukan sekedar memperebutkan seorang wanita melainkan sebuah persoalan harga diri bangsa Yunani yang diinjak injak oleh pasukan Troy  Maka berangkatlah pasukan koalisi Achean dengan 1000 kapalnya berlayar menuju Troy Selama sepuluh tahun pasukan Achean mengepung tembok pertahanan Troy  namun Troy tak berhasil juga direbut hingga akhirnya atas ide Odyyseus yang cerdik dibuatlah seolah olah kapal perang pasukan Achean hendak berlayar pulang dengan meninggalkan sebuah  cenderamata  berupa Patung Kuda  Oleh pasukan Troy  patung Kuda itu lalu diarak masuk ke dalam benteng Troy  mereka sama sekali tak menduga bahwa di dalam patung kuda besar itu bersembunyi 40 prajurit Achean Saat penduduk Troy tertidur lelap keluarlah 40 prajurit Achean dari patung kuda untuk membuka gerbang kota Troy sehingga seluruh pasukan Achean dapat masuk menyerang  Malam itu juga pasukan Achean melakukan pembantaian besar besaran dan kota Troy pun jatuh ke tangan Achean dan Helen verhaduk dibawa pulang ke Sparta The IlliadDari keseluruhan legenda Perang Troy tersebut  The Iliad hanya menceritakan saat peperangan hampir berakhir  Tokoh sentral dalam Iliad adalah Achilles  Agamemon  dan Hector  Kisahnya dibuka dengan perseteruan antar sesama pasukan kolaisi Achean antara Raja Agamemnon dengan Achiles  salah seorang pajurit terbaik Achean  Konflik yang disebabkan karena Agamemnon menculik seorang pendeta wanita kuil Apollo yang merupakan tawanan Achilles membuat Achilles  ngambek   mogok berperang dan memutuskan untuk tinggal dalam kemahnya kecuali jika pasukan Troy menginjak nginjak perkemahannya Walau dibujuk oleh para dewa dewa Yunani dan beberapa koleganya untuk berdamai dengan Agamenom  Achiles menolak berdamai  Keegoisan dan kesombongan Achiles ini menyebabkan pasukan Achean terdesak oleh pasukan Troy Kekukuhan Achilles untuk menolak bertempur bersama Agamemon ke Troy akhirnya luluh ketika Patroclus  sepupunya gugur ketika berhadapan dengan Hector  pangeran Troy  Ia lalu bersumpah akan membunuh langsung Hector dengan tangannya sendiri Dengan amarahnya yang menggebu gebu dan didorong oleh kesedihan yang luar biasa akibat kematian sepupunya akhirnya Achilles berangkat berperang dan berhadapan langsung dengan Hector  Achilles berhasil membunuh Hector  Tak puas dengan membunuhnya ia menyeret mayat Hector mengelilingi kota Troy dan membawa pulang jasadnya ke tendanya Raja Priam  ayah Hector tentunya tak tinggal diam  melihat jasad putra kesayangannya diperlakukan dengan keji oleh Achilless Ia segera menyelinap ke dalam tenda pasukan Achean untuk menemui Achiless dan memohon agar ia bisa membawa mayat anaknya untuk dikuburkan secara layak di kota Troy ReviewPada intinya kisah utama yang diceritakan Homer dalam The Iliad adalah kemarahan Achilles baik itu kepada Raja Agamemon maupun Hector  namun diluar kisah itu ada banyak kisah kisah lain seperti bagaimana Oddyseus dan Diomedes memata matai Troy  duel Menelaus melawan Paris  pertarungan Achilles dengan dewa penjaga sungai Schamander   dll yang semuanya menyiratkan ambisi  harga diri  keberanian  dan ketabahan para pahlawan pahlawannya Sebetulnya perang Troy bisa cepat selesai jika saja Achilles tidak marahan dengan Agamemnon  panjangnya peperangan membuat kedua pihak kelelahan bahkan pasukan Achean sempat ingin mundur dari peperangan  Peran para dewa juga membuat perang semakin berkepanjangan  Maju mundurnya peperangan juga ditentukan oleh para dewa dan dewi  Dalam mitologi Yunani kuno manusia tak ubahnya seperti wayang yang dikendalikan oleh beberapa dalang sekaligus sehingga apa yang terjadi di bumi merupakan hasil kesepakatan dari para dewa  jika dewa dewa saling konflik maka imbasnya akan terjadi pula di bumi Di kahyangan sendiri keberpihakan para dewa terpecah antara yang memihak pasukan Achean dan pasukan Troy  Masing masing dewa mengatur langsung jalannya peperangan  mereka tak segan untuk turun ke bumi dan menyamar sebagai sahabat dekat orang yang ingin dipengaruhinya  selain itu para dewa juga bisa langsung membawa kabur jagoannya yang dalam keadaan terdesak sehingga jagoannya itu terhindar dari pedang lawannyaBuku yang diterjemahkan ke dalam bahasa Indonesia ini merupakan terjemahan dari versi ringkasnya  sejatinya The Iliad merupakan puisi epik terindah yang pernah ditulis sepanjang sejarah yang terdiri dari 15 639 baris sajak  Namun karena yang menjadi dasar terjemahannya adalah versi ringkasnya maka keindahan puisinya menjadi hilang sehingga membaca The Iliad tak ubahnya membaca sebuah kisah perang semata Di buku ini juga terdapat puluhan nama nama dewa berikut pahlawan Achean dan Troy beserta kisah kisahnya  Bagi mereka yang tidak terbiasa membaca kisah mitologi Yunani tentunya hal ini akan sedikit menyulitkan baik dari nama nama dewa tokoh2nya yang sulit dieja maupun juga dari berbagai kisah dalam buku ini yang sebenarnya memiliki latar belakang kejadian yang tidak ditulis dalam The Iliad Jadi sebelum membaca The Iliad alangkah baiknya kita membaca dulu tentang kisah dan dunia mitologi Yunani agar lebih memahami apa yang melatarbelakangi kisah kisah dalam The Iliad  atau mungkin ada baiknya penerbit dalam kata pengantarnya menyertakan juga sedikit mengenai latar belakang terjadinya Perang Troy dan bagaimana peran dewa dewa di masa itu agar pembaca yang awam bisa lebih menikmati buku ini Ada beberapa kesalahan ketik ada dalam buku ini  walau tidak banyak namun hal ini seharusnya bisa dicegah pada saat porses proof reading buku ini  Dari segi terjemahan  ada dua kata yang saya rasa terjemahannya kurang tepat yaitu kata  suster   hal      dan kata  tidur bareng   hal 146  Saya rasa menggunakan kata  suster  dalam konteks yunani kuno tidaklah pas  rasanya lebih tepat jika digunakan kata  pengasuh   Sedangkan kata  tidur bareng  akan lebih elok jika diterjemahkan menjadi  tidur bersama  Namun terlepas dari itu  upaya menerjemahkan The Iliad ke dalam bahasa Indonesia patut diapresiasi dengan baik  Kita mungkin pernah membaca atau menonton Kisah perang Troy dalam berbagai versi namun membaca langsung perang Troy dari The Iliad ini tentunya memberikan sensasi tersendiri karena karya yang ditulis oleh Homer ribuan tahun yang lalu yang juga dianggap sebagai tonggak kesusasteraan dunia ini akhirnya dapat dibaca dalam bahasa Indonesia Tentang HomerHomer  diperkirakan hidup di abad ke 8 SM  karena tidak ada data biografis mengenai dirinya maka tidak banyak yang diketahui tentang dirinya  Kita hanya tahu Homer berusia panjang  hidup dalam kemiskinan dan mengembara dari satu negeri ke negeri lainnya  dan ia bisa bertahan hidup dengan membacakan puisi puisinya di setiap daerah yang ia singgahi Setelah kematiannya  Homer mendapat penghargaan yang sangat besar dari dunia  Lima puluh kota di Yunani mengklaim diri sebagai tanah kelahirannya  namun sebagian besar kalangan menganggap pulau Chi os adalah negeri kelahiran Homer yang pasti bahasa yang digunakan dalam The Iliad   Oddysey menunjukkan bahwa Homer berasal dari Ionia  daerah sebelah timur laut Aegea Ada tradisi kuno yang teramat kokoh  berasal dari masa awal awal Yunani  bahwa Homer itu buta  Tetapi  kehebatan yang tampak secara visual dari kedua sajak itu menunjukkan andaikan benar Homer itu buta  maka itu bukan bawaan dari lahir  Bahasa yang digunakan dalam sajak itu menunjukkan bahwa Homer berasal dari Ionia  daerah sebelah timur laut Aegea Ada beberapa ahli yang meragukan apakah The Iliad dan Oddysey itu meruapakan karya asli Homer  Pada abad abad sebelum Homer memang banyak sajak sajak yang lebih pendek mengenai Perang Troy yang yang digubah oleh penyair penyair Yunani lain  dan Homer banyak mengambilnya dari karya mereka  Tetapi  Homer berbuat lebih jauh dari sekedar merakit Iliad dari sajak sajak pendek yang sudah ada sebelumnya  Dia memilih  dia mengatur  dia menyempurnakan kata kata dan menambahnya serta pada akhirnya melengkapinya menjadi hasil final dengan bakat sastranya yang genius Hingga kini The Iliad dianggap sebagai karya sastra tertua dari dunia Barat  Bahkan orang orang Yunani sendiri mengakui pengaruh Homer dan tidak menganggap diri mereka berpendidikan kecuali jika mereka telah membaca karya karyanya  htanzilhttp   bukuygkubaca blogspot

librosdeolethros blogspot com     About halfway through reading this epic poem I was trying to think of the last time that I read something which could easily be classified as  war literature   It s been a long time  I ve got lots on my bookshelf  but it seems as though I m not all that interested in reading it  Perhaps it was The Cellist of Sarajevo by Stephen Galloway  which is a very good book  Or maybe it was The Regeneration Trilogy by Pat Barker  which I would struggle to call anything less than masterful  I ve read a couple books  like Age of Iron by JM Coetzee  a masterpiece   which have included conflict  The bristling beginnings of a civil war  perhaps  But it wasn t about war  and the conflict was really only seething or bubbling beneath the surface rather   What a great force it was though    The same can be said of The Story of Lucy Gault  Leaving the Atocha Station  The Baron in the Trees  July s People  and Dusklands  Conflict  physical and massive  insurrection  a great physical debate over sovereignty   these are all features of these stories  None of these quite qualify though I guess I have to go back to the good  though flawed  book that first introduced me to the story of Achilles and Atrides  Hector and Patroclus  and the assault on Priam s Troy  Madeleine Miller s The Song of Achilles is that book  And reading the source material  The Iliad  I was surprised at how much I need The Song of Achilles to help me picture some of the events  and then surprised at how much that interpretation had twisted my ability to understand this story on its own  The source material is far superior The Iliad is a broad  layered story about war that mixes the worlds of the individual with that of his  nation  with that of the great  divine immortal Gods  And each layer is fascinating  As a story about war  it is also a story about the destruction of lives  and of the readers  ever increasing desensitization  For this reason and many others  The Iliad is a deeply troubling story You see  many  many men die in this story  The names flow by like a genealogical list taken from the Old Testament  Each man has some legendary skill  some promising life  which is cut short by some other man who has some legendary skill  some promising life  Each man has an extra name attached to his own  his father s  which will mourn his loss  And each man s death is dramatic  graphic  hand to hand and face to face  a contest in which all men are made equal and yet none are as good as Achilles Achilles  Achilles  Achilles  That man whose glory is made because of his great power  which is only revealed because of his great vanity  He refuses to fight for years  and the entire army of his nation  the Achaeons  is almost wiped out entirely as a result  Men died   not for him  but because of him  And because of his great god like origins  his great power  and the meddling of the Gods of Olympus in this most human of all tragedies I think it is worth mentioning a great deal about the scope of the characters on display in this tale  because it is worth pointing out that none of them are particularly detailed or well rounded  and certainly not in the way that a 21st Century Reader of Literary Fiction would desire or demand  I would actually say that these characters are profoundly shallow  But I didn t mind  in the end  though the lack of character development was somewhat confusing  That said  it allowed me to construct very simple understandings of the men and  few  women in this story  and so I connected them almost singularly to certain character traits or ideas  And I saw their success as an embodiment of the success of this ideal or trait  Perhaps this is less true of the Gods than of the men  as they seemed to be in debate with each other on a regular basis  and that conflict allowed their characters to thicken slightly  But none of this cream turned into butter  whether the speaker was mortal or divine  But that was the point  and is the enduring point of this parable   and it was the thinness of the characters that made them both mythical and terrifying in their singular vision  There may be a good deal more to this idea about the thinness of characters and how it can affect a plot driven book set in a plotless novel  as it occurs to me that some of my favourite novels by JM Coetzee are peopled by characters who are quite thin but whose actions are profoundly metaphorical   I would also argue that Madeleine Miller s book  The Song of Achilles  may have been fated to fail based on this source material as it could not more effectively explore the relationship between Achilles and Patroclus  These two characters were not structured by  Homer  to people a book  but they were figures whose stories were made to be told around fires by men inhaling smoke and exhaling poetry  That is why the romantic relationship she envisions comes off as shallow  thin  overly romantic and entirely impossible  even if there are sufficiently strong hints in the final books of The Iliad to suggest the two were more than just good friends  Ultimately  this is a marvelous story about war  and perhaps its greatest indictment that I have ever read  though I do not think I have ever read any story which has depicted war as anything other than tragic   It lends itself to many interpretations  many analyses  and yet still feels like it is complete and self contained without all of that extra work put in  The translation here is perhaps less consistent than the one provided by Fagles in The Odyssey  but it is still good  at times beautiful  often resonant  regularly troubling  Now to move on to Simone Weil s War and the Iliad  and then  one day  read The Aeneid  Go beneath the bloody layers of severed arms and broken skulls crushed by horses  hoofs  Keep breathing  you ll soon be beyond the stench of sweating  terrified men dying of punctured bowel wounds  Keep listening to the poetry  because below the high pitched screams of the women being raped lie several stories of bravery and cowardice  regular as heartbeats  and as you reach the end you ll recognize that stories of strength and honor have been thrumming through the gore since page one  Yes  we re expected to like characters who keep sex slaves  But keep reading  Women are property in this violent universe and Homer was no feminist  We are expected to feel Aristotle s pity and fear for the warriors while feeling nothing for the voiceless women they kidnap and rape  Once  however  we get past the battlefield and behind the walls of Troy into a more domestic sphere  the women become people  not things  Helen  Hecuba and Andromache seem as familiar to us as our college roommates  once we are off the battlefield  IF one can get past the misogyny  and I m not sure I ever did  what the reader reaches is a series of timeless stories  Achilles and his tendency to translate every emotion into rage  Agamemnon as a childish  inept leader  and the strongest and most beautiful of the stories  Hector s love for his wife and family and his willingness to sacrifice himself for the greater good Oh  yeah  It certainly DOES glorify war and has been used as pro war propaganda for thousands of years  As a recovering military brat of sorts  I knew the U of C works about war  and GOD there are so MANY   would be a challenge for me  A frequently assigned paper topic for undergrads is deciding whether or not the Iliad glorifies war  I don t think a 19 year old who has never served can answer that question  I work in a rough neighborhood in a public library that is across the street from a VFW hall  The VFW hall serves beer in the morning  I ve heard war story confessions that make Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket seem like Disney movies  Make no mistake the Iliad glorifies war  no matter what the corpse count is  It leaves out the worst  Introduce yourself to a homeless  brain fried PTSD frizzled Vietnam Vet in the park someday and you ll begin to get the picture   Shout out to Royroy and Rayray  where ever you are  Keep drinking Ice House  guys  The rage of Achilles is presented as a purifying killing spree  a cleansing and orgiastic fire of anger and wrath that helps win the war for the Greeks  It even made me want to be Achilles  to be relieved of a conscience  to be freed from seeing other people as human  Agamemnons and Machiavellis and Hitlers and Bushes throughout history have used this poem to release and sanctify the rage in the peasant classes  This work helps funnel the young  dumb  poor and angry into futile wars for corrupt leaders  Few undergrads know enough about war or the corruption of leaders throughout history to see how this brutal  bloody poem makes anger and violence seem so very  very necessary  and absolutely beautiful  and without repercussion  No sabia si comentar el libro por ser un clasico archiconocido  pero dare mi impresion general  Es una interesante lectura que te acerca a la mitologia griega y a la mentalidad de aquella epoca lejana tan distinta en valores y costumbres a cualquier otra epoca d c    La forma de relatar  con descripciones repetidas para recordar las caracteristicas principales de los heroes  dioses y resto de contendientes  hacen la lectura un tanto pesada  y la profusion de personajes y dinastias tambien contribuye a ralentizar la lectura y a que  a veces  se torne confusa  pero la descricpcion de las batallas  contundente  clara y sin apenas adejtivos  impresiona  Son muy llamativas las metaforas utilizadas para describir tanto emociones  como la ira  el amor  el odio o el miedo   como para  pintar  los espacios  dimensiones  distancias    En una epoca en la que lo audiovisual no existia  se consiguen imagenes nitidas de lo descrito  No entiendo por que una lectura que no es facil  aunque si bella y aleccionadora  fue durante mucho tiempo lectura escolar obligatoria  ya que no creo que fomente la lectura en quien todavia esta cultivando su gusto lector  Muy buena  pero densa  Wow  what can I say about this book  First of all  it s 600 pages of pure  incredibly gruesome action  It is also the first war book I ve ever read that names every single soldier who takes part in the battle  their background  and  of course  an incredibly detailed account of how they are slain  Let me give you an example of poor Erymas  fate  Book Sixteen  Line 403   Idomeneus thrust hard at Erymas  mouthwith his hard bronze  The spearhead passed on throughbeneath his brain and split the white brain pan His teeth were dashed out  blood filled both his eyes and from his mouth and nostrils as he gapedhe spurted blood  Death s cloud enveloped him  I think to say that death s cloud enveloped poor old Erymas at that point is somewhat a statement of the obvious  don t you  Hey Homer  ever heard the expression Too Much Information   Just kidding  I love every disgusting detail  The Iliad is a book for the reader who not only is concerned with the tide and action of the battle  but also with exactly which organs are punctured  which limbs lopped off  and which entrails gushed from each wound  Not for the feint of heart  indeed One other observation I have from this book is that the Greek Gods are some seriously catty  fickle bastards  When they re not too busy scheming against each other they like to go down and mess with the soldiers  either knocking their weapons out of their hands or shrouding them in invincible golden clouds  One second Zeus is favoring the Trojans  then some random Akhaian spills a little wine in his honor and the next thing you know the head honcho is backing the other side  Zeus needs to have some more self respect and not whore out his services for the slightest bit of attention  In summary though the book rocks  4 5 5Intente hacer una resena decente sobre una historia y un libro que lo merecen  pero entre que tengo otras cosas en mente  mucho dolor de cabeza y tarea  prefiero no esforzarme  Lo unico que puedo decir es que  me gusto mas la Odisea  y quiza mi error fue esperar de esta lo mismo o mas  aunque tambien hubo otros  Me molesto la manera en que lo dimos en el colegio  casi dejandolo en segundo plano  sin darle bola  cosa muy diferente a lo que fue el ano pasado  lo que me hizo disfrutar tanto la lectura  No se  siento que si lo hubiera leido mas tranquila  relajada o en otro momento de mi vida  lo habria disfrutado mas  pero por ahora es la sensacion que me deja  Seguro en algunos meses la cambie o tenga mas en claro lo que me parecio la historia  pero como dije  por ahora es esta mi opinion   Richards succeeds admirably in his aim of making the classic Iliad available in an edition for non  specialist readers  focusing on the narrative and retaining brilliance of language and metaphor  Next on the list is Lattimore s translation  Two weeks of daily reading   BattleFatigue and living on  CombatRations of coffee and

like something you would really like to hear recited with a gathering of your friends around a large bonfire on a crisply cool fall night  The theme of the  rage of Achilles  is palpable at times  and the character of an aggressive Hector is perhaps more robust and muscular in this translation than some I ve read Something that I think Powell s rendition does very well is footnote everything  saving the reader from flipping to the back of the poem  Additionally  he has included a great number of photographs of ancient Greek illustrated pottery that highlight events from The Iliad  Excellent maps and a superb glossary round out this edition and make it a keeper  I m guessing that it has been formatted to be a college text  and I am guessing it will do well in that role  All in all is this a no nonsense  quality translation of a timeless story that every human should read at least once in their lifetime  I first read this in school  in Spanish  but definitely didn t get much out of it and by now I pretty much forgot most of it  so since I wanted to  fresh  up on it mostly because I wanted to read The Odyssey  for the first time  I came up with the GREAT idea of watching the movie   Troy 2004  Why not  How bad could it be  Well  just as the movie Lolita  it was a terrible idea    and just as the movie Lolita  it got me somewhat pissed off  Lolita not as much though  and to be fair  the movie Lolita does seem to at least try to do a somewhat decent adaptation  because of the way they messed me up as to how I had originally imagined the characters  But I m not going to get into a rant of the movie here  that was obviously my mistake  and who cares anyway  So  since the least thing I could have done was reading it again  that s precisely what I did  And what did I learn To me  Homer s master plan was to educate and build CHARACTER  and he knew he wasn t going to achieve it with  Super Men  supernatural beings or Gods    He went for mortals  1  Real  flesh and blood CHARACTERS like us  and all simply set in the middle of war  like many others that had been and will continue to come    There s drama  prides challenged  anger leading to silliness and love to madness  but all in all NORMAL stuff  the same we all see constantly  and with all the obvious morals such as  the many beautiful things one can lose when pride gets in the way  the dangers of obsession  power and anger  the importance of listening to the ones that love us  that violence isn t always the right option and most of the time can be prevented and all the cliches we can invoke    but the bottom line is  it s a learning experience  And if we had the privilege to read it  we should at least try not to do the same mistakes Here s a nice image to dissipate and hopefully remove that Brad Pitt   Achilles association  I just can t even begin to even      The Greeks and Trojans fighting over the body of Patroclus  1836  Antoine Joseph Wiertz Belgian  1806 1865  oil  canvas  Footnotes 1  Well  obviously there are  but the main characters  at least in my opinion and what I m talking about  are Achilles   Hector  There s actually an interesting read on wikipedia about role of Gods  and mortals essentially lacking in what we call consciousness  but that s out of the scope of this review    Thoughts while reading   I want more on the gods  The characters are so hilariously human and petty   UGH  NO MORE BATTLE SCENES  PLEASE  Sweet Moses  the endless parade of named characters who show up only to be killed  What is this  Genesis   I NEED TO KNOW WHO TO INVEST IN AND THE RELENTLESS  POINTLESS NAMING EXHAUSTS ME   Wow  this is surprisingly violent   Wow  this is long   Oh my word  I love Hector   I am ashamed I have never read this before   I am so glad I read this   it is an invaluable piece of Western literature and history  and familiarity with it makes me feel more connected to the legacy of so many things I love   I am so glad I never have to read this again   Man  this is THE textbook for a constellation of representational issues surrounding the intersection of torsos and javelins  Also  any study of war texts should include this or at least keep it in mind  It s just a hop  skip and jump from here to Mallory  Chretien de Troyes and all those other bedrock narratives from which other English language romanticizations of war and combat spring It s kind of stupid to rate a book like this  But here it is  4 stars  Because Chapman dicked us out of some books which the GRE subject test better not bring up  El tema central de la obra es la colera de Aquiles  tal como se describe en los primeros versos  La Iliada es el poema epico de la juventud de Homero  El autor aun conserva la cualidad de ser un vate  inspirado por dios  y las musas   sin embargo  ya esta hablando de una epoca en la que es posible ver la transformacion de una cosmogonia que pasa de lo ritual del clan a algo mas cercano a una monarquia feudal  En el texto es posible ver una fusion entre lo divino y lo humano  dado que se retoman elementos de lo mitico y lo historico  Incluso hay escenas en las cuales los dioses y los hombres se enfrentan cuerpo a cuerpo  Diomedes llega a herir a Afrodita en el canto V   Socialmente los personajes tienen una fuerte carga valorativa dado que son actantes que responden a los requerimientos de la poesia heroica pero tienen una serie de valores de lo aristocratico  Asi  el mundo que concibe Homero es aristocratico pero los personajes ya responden a otro tipo de logicas mas cercanas a lo feudal  Si consideramos que el modo de ser de la nobleza esta cambiando en la epoca de La Iliada  podemos entender que esta obra esta a media marcha entre dos tipos de concepcion de la sociedad  Es la primera gran obra que con elementos de la poesia heroica es ya epopeya  pasa de utilizar el canto ritual y las construcciones de leyendas a un canto aristocratico y con una construccion estructural elaborada  deja asi el tono lirico  lira   para ser epico  baston   Asi  en la edad heroica el canto pierde su caracter colectivo ritual y pasa a narrar los problemas de los sujetos  para Hausser  las marcas de La Iliada  ya estan indicando un canto individual que habla sobre el destino individual  Asi  los cantos heroicos que tenian como funcion narrar lo ocurrido en las guerras se convierten en objetos epicos al mezclar la historia conocida de las guerras y las batallas  con las leyendas de los dioses  Homero representa un primer quiebre en el que se estructura una obra a partir de la insercion de la leyenda en las primeras construcciones urbanas Para Mijail Bajtin   Epica y novela    obras como La Iliada  tienen como marca particular una distancia epica  Esta distancia consiste en la transferencia del mundo representado en el escrito al mundo de un pasado absoluto  Dicho pasado epico absoluto se describe como un mundo cerrado  finito y acabado  Este lugar se marca como el inicio de todo lo bueno y los personajes como prototipos que nunca se lograran igualar  Bajtin marca reiteradamente que el mundo es jerarquico y valorativo  dado que la distancia no es temporal  sino que hay una relacion tan estrecha entre la obra y el mundo en el cual esta inscrita  que es muy dificil entender su relacion cosmogonica literaria  Es por esto que la epopeya esta rodeada por una frontera absoluta que la separa de todos los tiempos posteriores  Finalmente  la palabra epica esta construida de acuerdo a la palabra de la leyenda  es una obra que se estructura como apoyo a la leyenda impersonal e incontestable  es universal  Hay varios temas que aparecen en La Iliada  a  El nostos  o el regreso  El recuerdo constante de la tierra que han dejado los heroes y a la cual ya no podran volver  b  El Kleos  o la gloria en combate  Es la gran decision que debe tomar Aquiles  vivir largo tiempo siendo un anonimo o morir rapido y tener kleos  nostos vs kleos   c  La Ananke el destino de los hombres  Contrario a lo que pasara en la tragedia  el hombre no tiene opcion de elegir  debe seguir el dictamen de los dioses  El destino es un ente tan poderoso que incluso era superior a los dioses  d  Las emociones de los hombres  La debilidad de los hombres  su fragilidad  esta marcada por unas emociones que los manejan  al igual que lo hacen los dioses   ira  ambicion  orgullo son las causas de todas las acciones en la epopeya Esta obra es una confluencia de invencion poetica  leyenda heroica e historia indirecta  La Iliada fue una fuente de la moral practica a la vez que funcionaba como un texto de memoria colectiva  Las virtudes y los ideales La Iliada fueron aceptados como objetivos educativos aristocratas  Dichos objetivos fueron tanto de conocimientos practicos  tecnicos  de la guerra  como un manual de comportamiento social  eticos   Presenta el paso del relato popular basado en Dioses  al relato de hombres sobre quienes pesa un destino superior  La suerte de Troya depende de que Aquiles se decida a morir  matando  Para lograr esto hay una serie de actos imprescindibles  primero ofender el honor caballeresco  punto sensible del sistema moral   despues ponerlo en un estado de ceguera pasional  lograr que el agraviado haga justicia por sus propias manos  no por la de los dioses   la restitucion de la normalidad con la peticion final de Priamo  Finally reading one of the cornerstones of Western literature  I was surprised to find the story circumscribed from what I had thought  it only covered the last month and a half of the war  anger of Achilles through burial of Hector  Massively boring until Book 9  Descriptions of fighting and killing were more gruesome and graphic than many modern novels  It was difficult to tell who is speaking  since each speaker uses very long dialogue and speaks in paragraphs  I know it s a poem and originally meant to be recited  but I wish it were divided like a novel  I discovered some incidents I didn t realized Homer had included  since I had read only summaries or retellings  At Book 19 began the really familiar incidents  death of Patroclos  entry of Achilleus into the war  his killing of Hector in revenge for the death of Patroclos  Priam s pleading for Hector s body  The death of Patroclos seemed to influence and overshadow subsequent action  I never realized the importance of Telomonian Aias  Ajax    he was the only one not given divine help as the other characters were  or else minimal aid  The chariot race and funeral games section was fantastic  Fascinating how human the gods and goddesses were  how they took sides and tried to manipulate the action  often with shape shifting  I can see where Virgil chose Aeneas as HIS hero  since Aeneas was one of the few Trojans left alive or not carried off into slavery  I certainly did appreciate the glossary  subject index   I referred to it often while reading  I read Lattimore s translation  which I didn t like much at first but it grew on me  I m eager to try Fagles  since I liked his Aeneid  My personal favourite quote     Peneleos now wounded him in the eye under his eyebrows  tearing the eyeball from its socket  the spear went right through the eye into the nape of the neck  and he fell  stretching both hands before him  Peneleos now drew his sword and smote him on the neck  so that both head and helmet came tumbling down to the ground with the spear still sticking in his eye  he then held up the head  as though it had been a poppy head  and showed it to the Trojans  vaunting over them as he did so  Well  that  or      The spear  struck him where the head springs from the neck at the top joint of the spine  and severed both the tendons at the back of the head  His head  mouth  and nostrils reached the ground long before his legs and knees could do so  Ahh  I love the smell of the decaying corpses of ancient demigods and heavy stacks of required reading in the morning On the surface  The Iliad  Homer s piece of literary genius which lives on immortal throughout the ages  looks very much like a long winded and tedious gorefest featuring an endlessly long list of bloodthirsty  Zeus begotten and Ares peered man children grinding each other s teeth into the backs of their skulls in a series of arguments over a variety of things  who owns which woman  who can hold a grudge the longest  who can make the brains of their enemy splatter the farthest  and most entrails bowels livers dragged out and spread upon the ground per second all seem to be quite popular   Your success in all those things  by the way  depend largely on how dysfunctional Zeus s incestuous and abusive  i e   Hey  Hera  sweet sister and darling wife of mine  remember that time I had you hanged  Good times  I m in half a mind to thrash you now   Buckets of blood  They don t tell you that in your Greek Myths for Children  divine household is feeling on that particular day week era  and they actually always look a bit like the Montagues and the Capulets trying to share one bathroom   But scratching a little  well  maybe a lot  deeper and wiping off the clotted gore  there s a profound sort of raw humanity to be found in it  The various underlying motives of each character  the love or hate or unadulterated rage that drives them on towards a bloody fate are really quite brilliant  I was a bit surprised at how easy it is to read  or maybe that was because I d read  Black Ships Before Troy  beforehand  which  by the way  I highly recommend you do  or  The Children s Homer    or just  you know  jump right in and hope you don t die   and then in turn at how shockingly repetitious it became  also at how unbelievably graphic and gory it is  For some reason I wasn t expecting that   I often had the most extraordinary sensation of deja vu   Haven t I already read something about his goodly greaves  comely feet  what the heck is with the feet      fierce lions slaughtering sheep  redoubtable bronze shod spears  brains besplattering the inside of helmets  and darkness veiling his eyes   I ask as I confusedly flip back several pages and realize that I have  in fact  read it several times before and I m somehow still moving forward in this really long book  Another surprising thing I found was how small the scope of it was  I went in expecting an overview of the Trojan War  but it was much more focused on Achilles  incredible anger management issues  So it s nice and personal  I guess  Also  I kept getting the distinct taste of blood in my mouth  although it might ve been actual blood  as I had my wisdom teeth pulled somewhere around book XI and the gaping holes in my gums kept oozing until I was well into book XXII  I can definitely recommend you also pulling some teeth out when you read it as it creates a lovely 4D effect There are several reasons why you should read this  I can t really remember what they are right now    they were probably something like 1  ascending on a cloud  bathed in glorious rays of light  to the prestigious ranks of the Snobs of Academia and being able to quote it and understand references to it  2  really annoying and childish but incredibly fascinating deities and there dysfunctionality  3  the writing is gorgeous  4  the characters  Hector s a bloodthirsty dear  Achilles makes me want to rip my hair out  and Helen and Briseis make me want to shoot something  so you get a nice  rich diversity  5  maybe you like studying human nature  the ups  the downs  the honour and glory and love  the let s kill whole civilizations because my buddy died because I was being 4 yr old rage parties  6  the detailed description of death  guts  blood  and the rearrangement of bowels are lovely and vivid  7  and to top it all off  it isn t half bad  It s not my favourite  but it sure is good  My good friend  if  when we were out of this fight  we could escape old age and death thenceforward and for ever  I should neither press forward nor bid you do so  but death in ten thousand shapes hangs over our heads  and no man can elude him  therefore let us go forward and either win glory for ourselves  or yield it to another  Note  I read the Samuel Butler translation  he seemed to think that several of the names and all of the gods should be Latinized  which was somewhat distracting   and  while it was beautifully written for the most part  I can t help but think the Robert Fagles edition is the way to go  if ever I should fancy a reread  Although I m 99  sure that won t be for several years at least  Not only is the Iliad a classic  but one could call it the classic of all classics  And this  of course  makes writing a tidy little review well nigh impossible  You d be hard pressed to overstate the enormous influence of Homer s epic  for an example  one only needs to look as far as the closest occidental literary work composed within the last 3000 years   which means that it s difficult to disentangle its historical importance from its independent artistic merits  if such a differentiation is even possible in the first place As a result  the struggling reviewer is caught between two looming horns  On the one hand  it seems as if it could be easy to overestimate the text s worth by confusing the scope of its literary significance with its individual qualities  Yet on the other  its cultural ubiquitousness could also serve to desensitize the reader to its legitimate merits  which would make it the likely recipient of underestimation  It s tough  for instance  for modern ears to appreciate just how fresh and original the opening bars to Beethoven s Fifth sounded during its 1808 Vienna premier  But Homer  the relevant scholars tell us  composed his poem some three millennia earlier  how can we even begin to fathom its original oomph  Make no mistake  like countless generations of readers  and listeners  before me  I was greatly impressed by the Iliad  with its astonishingly sophisticated psychologies and its simultaneous glorification and condemnation of war  But I will not hide the fact that at times I found it very difficult  It is long and it is repetitive  although Robert Fagles  stunning translation does much to offset the tedium  So at the end of the day  I think the respect I have for the Iliad weighs more than the fun I had while reading it  I recall coming upon this book at the Park Ridge Public Library  Dad had recommended Robert Graves to me as one of his preferred authors from shipboard during WWII and successive teachers had mentioned Homer  Indeed  I had already read a young adult s version of the Odyssey  Graves  version of the Iliad seemed a natural As I recall  the edition picked up in the library had an interesting introduction by Graves wherein he claimed that the Iliad was usually mistranslated out of a misapprehension of the text and its purpose  Homer was all about entertainment  Graves stated  and a good deal of the Iliad is supposed to be funny  much of it being a social satire of the high and mighty As one might imagine  Graves  Iliad was an easier read than Lattimore s or any of the other serious  scholarly versions we were forced to use in college  funnier too Now  of course  I know that Graves  is an idiosyncratic translation  just as all of his translations of the classics are  Homer was the bible of the Greeks  but its origins  both as regards the texts themselves and their supposed oral precursors  are shrouded  The version usually presented as Homer s is  in fact  a late Athenian version as is indicated by the inclusion of Attic shiplists  Athens may not have existed during the Trojan War  but the teller of the tale to an Athenian audience would be prone to put the ships and their local heroes in their to suit the audience  In any case  given eventual Athenian economic dominance over the hellenic world and its relatively large publishing operations  series of scribes taking dictation   the Athenian version is the standard  the most complete and the most well attested  however circular what counts as attestation So  did Homer s Iliad have versions which played to the groundlings  making fun of the high and mighty  divine and human  It is quite possible that it did  given the popularity of its stories through the centuries  Is this a fair version of the Athenian text from which Graves was working  That is more debatable  though his point  I think  is well taken and the product of his labors is of considerable literary merit Often Graves  Anger of Achilles appears alongside his novel  Homer s Daughter  a fictional elaboration of some of his peculiar ideas about the original Homeridae quite in keeping with his notions of original Great Mother worship being supplanted by patriarchal sky gods  Although eccentric  it is a pleasure to read someone who writes so well  so knowledgeably  so entertainingly and so contentiously about the  ahem  Great Books   This review is of the New American Library  Mentor  edition  published as a paperback in the 1950s  If you are to tackle Homer  you need a used paperback for the actual slogging  as you ll be turning pages and all but tearing the binding by the time you re done  You should also have a real book  leatherbound with excellent typeset  which will proudly stand on your bookshelf as the first masterpiece among masterpieces  If you need to make notes  get the ebook and start the highlighting This translation is by Rouse  which is why my review is not five stars  Granted  it s THE ILIAD  but not my favorite version  Here it is set up almost as a novel  albeit a very clustered novel  Since Achilles is rather angry throughout the entire expedition  I would hope for more rage but you ll have to turn to Lattimore for that angle Still  it all starts with Homer  doesn t it  For me  I recall having a job in the law courts and scurrying to the office of the  Elder Judge  after a day s work was completed  where we would sit spellbound before him as he orated the Homeric saga to us   The King prefers a good warhorse to a conscientious objector   Wonder of wonders Book Season   Year Round Another Iliad  It s the poem that that has launched a thousand translations  and here we have one more  Stephen Mitchell has an impressive resume of translations  including such renowned classics as Gilgamesh  Bhagavad Gita  various books of the Bible  Genesis  Job  Psalms   and Tao Te Ching  He is no lightweight and certainly up to the task of rendering the world s greatest war poem into English that is remarkably lucid I am familiar with Homer in Greek and have read many popular translations of the Iliad  including those by Lattimore  Fagles  Fitzgerald  and  more recently  Lombardo  Having read a few pages of this production  I must say that I like it    a lot  And I have a feeling that I am going to like it more and more as I read it more frequently  It is remarkably faithful to the original Greek without being stilted or tedious  It feels like an improvement over Lattimore  a translation that is as close to the Greek as you can get but whose lines often seem very unpoetic  or at least lacking in the sort of flow that you would expect from a translation of the Iliad This is not the place to explore Mitchell s decision to omit the Doloneia  Book 10  from his translation  Suffice to say that it is not here  for reasons owing to his belief that it is not a part of the original text  Asking me which are the best 50 books I ve ever read  Illiad and Odysse will be definatly two of them I name     books I don t get tired to read again and again ylyd w wdysh ps z yn hmh qrn khh z srwdh shdnshn gdhshth  hm chnn khwndny nd w myzn frwsh chp h w trjmh hy tzh shn bh zbn hy rwpyy rqyb pr frwsh tryn

rate  an ancient piece of literature that has become the foundation for the modern writing arts  Although the quality or intellectual aspects of a book are always factors in my rating  the ultimate influence is always how much I enjoyed a book  You don t enjoy The Iliad in the same way you do a modern novel  It reminds me of Foxe s Book of Martyrs  in its rather dusty listings of creative ways to kill people  I wouldn t read The Iliad just for fun And yet it is rather fun  Beneath all the un modern storyteling techniques  it s a vibrant story  full of rich characters  and  of course  action galore  The pacing is excellent  and the structure is  fascinatingly  perfect  according to  modern  strictures  I read a shitty prose translation of the Illiad a few years ago and hated it  I was amazed at how much more engaging and meaningful a verse translation is  Lattimore hews as close as possible to the source  so it doesn t quite take the poetic liberties that the Fagles translation does  but he does an excellent job overall  I was amazed to find that some of these passages where quite emotionally touching  I don t really expect books this old as having these odd little moments of tenderness  but the scene where Helen is standing on the Walls and recounting to Priam all of the Argives she knew before her abduction and her past life was really quite devastating in a way that all of the rote bloodshed never manages to be  This took some time but it was worth it  I want to read The Odyssey in this translation next  Some scenes flew by and I couldn t put the poem down and others I had to help myself from falling asleep  I should have spaced at this poem into more days than trying to tackle so many pages at a time  Oh well  lesson learned  I am also curious to the back story   what about the previous nine years  Does anything tell their tale  I m not sure  but I think this was the edition I read   liked the best   I ve read several over the years  I liked the  full  or  best translated  versions   the highly edited versions the least  There s a happy medium in there  The full versions have a lot characters   stuff going on that doesn t add to the story   just confuses me  When edited too much  the story loses its flavor  The story line  plot  can t be beat  Much of the motivation of the characters seems weak or over used  but that s only because it is the great granddaddy of so much of our current literature  of course   ymknny lqwl b n hdhh lnskh  mn llydh  hy  thr  lnskh lty qr th lG an  w jmlh nsjan w dban b D mlHZty  l  lktb  stkhdmh l sm lalh

classic epics that I should have read ages ago  although to be fair I did read an excerpt in college   So much depends on the translation  especially when it comes to poetry like this  and by many accounts of others  the translation I listened to  Fitzgerald s  is not considered the best  it was  however  narrated by Dan Stevens  so it was a very pleasant listening experience  at least I didn t realize how awful these ancient Greek  heroes  were  There is not one  hero  in this story that I could truly root for  They are all guilty of many flaws including extreme anger rage  jealously  selfishness  arrogance  pettiness     and that s just the humans  Bring the gods into it and it gets even worse Aside from that  the battle imagery is incredible  the personalities of the characters actually fairly believable  the poetry beautiful  There was actually quite a bit of action with various games and other adventures at the end  Ben Hur  anyone   and at least some apparent changes of heart that give the closest to redeeming qualities of some of the characters 4 5  I went to the library looking for the Fagles edition  They didn t have it  The librarian offered to get it from another branch  but I decided to check the shelves and found this which has turned out to be a very lucky choice  That said here is what I like  It has a contemporary feel  It moves  It has an intensity that just compels you to keep reading  Mitchell has achieved this by eliminating some of the stock epithets  such as   bronze clad Achaeans    flashing helmeted Hector   While these epithets in Greek elevate the style  the repetition in English becomes tiresome  He has also eliminated the many fixed epithets  Achilles   son of Peleus   Agamemnon   son of Atreus   More significantly  he eliminated Book 10  which scholars from ancient times have identified as an interpolation  perhaps not even Homer  Previous modern translators have relied on the Greek text of the Iliad from the Oxford Classical Texts edition published in 1902  Mitchell used the Homeri Ilias  one of the great works of textual scholarship recently compiled from multiple Greek sources by Professor M  L  West  Wherever West identified passages as probable interpolations  or conjectural reconstructions of corrupted text  Mitchell omitted them from his translation   Finally  he has relied on the advice of Ezra Pound to an aspiring translator of the Iliad    No one will give a damn about the meter  if there is FLOW   Mitchell s translation has flow and for me was a delight  As Elaine Pagels said in her blurb   Mitchell s translation is a brilliant accomplishment  It captures the fierce energy  rhythms  and powerful narrative of Homer s Greek in vivid and compelling English   I would recommend it to all   I started my Homer quest with  The Odyssey  and  to be honest  I m glad I did   The Iliad  is absolutely epic  graphic  heart breaking and insightful  but it s not a scratch on its counterpart  and  had I have read them in chronological order  I don t think I would have read  The Odyssey   This book was harder to get through and the sheer catalogue of characters and genealogy was a bit dizzying at times  but the end result is still amazing  I finished the book last night  and  at first  I was a little confused   it didn t end how my own personal version the Trojan war ended  so I thought I had missed something  But then I thought about it   dreamed about it too   and I realise how perfect an ending it was  The book is more a beautiful vision of the spoils  triumphs and tragedies of war than it is a documentation of events  through the shattered skulls  squashed brains  speared genitals and other gruesomeness  it s easy to lose that In short  it s a confusing journey but worth the effort  I genuinely believe that this book will take a few runs through before I ll even begin to appreciate it properly  but on my first pass through  I think it ll stay with me for a very long time   This is a great translation of the book  It s a very modernized version in a language that most people will easily understand and follow along with  The scenes are gory and the metaphors throughout are really interesting to think about  I read it for school and really enjoyed it  i relate to achilles bc i too have a lot of rage    A pesar del llanto  la bronca y la

of books I ve been in love with mythology for as long as I can remember and since I ve got back into reading  I ve been picking up classics to do with mythology and what better place to start than with The Illiad  I hadn t known a single thing about this when I went into it    I had heard of it but I had no idea it was an epic poem  and when I found that out I was a bit put off because poetry isn t really my thing  But omg  I am so glad I didn t let that put me off  This was incredible  I hardly read poetry and this was the first epic poem I ever read and it s just made me want to pick up more   though the next one I m gonna read is The Odyssey  of course  The mythology was incredible  the emotions that came pouring through with Patroclus  death and Achilles wrath  Everything was perfect and I just loved it so much  It still makes me laugh thinking about this story however  because Homer is such a fangirl over Paris  You can just tell how much he loves him  always calling him glorious and beautiful    even if he cannot decide whether he is called Paris or Alexander  That confused me a little because  well  you get settled with him getting called Paris and then an Alexander comes out of from nowhere  Helen really is a badass in this and it s just confirmed my thoughts already that I love her so much  And her and Hector s relationship is just incredible   how he doesn t blame her for the war  but blames Paris and how he s doomed them all and yeah  I really liked that  There were really a few parts in this that made me laugh at it  like  two soldiers stopping in the middle of a war to discuss their family tree and crap  Achilles new shield sounds heavy as hell due to all the crap that is portrayed on it and Agamemnon is such a douche and I hate him   lryfyw d

utter dick We start off on the plains of Troy  the Greeks have been camped out there for 9 years trying to get back Menaleus s  king of Sparta  wife  Helen  she whose face launched a thousand ships   who was whisked away by Paris as a reward because he d chosen Aphrodite as the most beautiful of the three goddesses who accosted him while he was doing a spot of shepherding   getting a gorgeous hottie  who happened to just up and leave her then husband  but mightily pissing off the other two goddesses  Hera  Mrs Zeus  and Pallas Athena  But you know all this   you know how Achilles gets in a huff because Agamemnon steals his stolen woman because he had to give his OWN stolen woman back because the Gods had cursed the Greeks because he d refused to give her back to her father the priest The men are cocks and the women are written so that they LOVE being slaves and LOVE being stolen by a he man in bronze armour and later given away to their mates as a reward for giving them a nice cup or chucking a javelin a long way I ve given it 4 stars however  because there s no doubting it s an amazing bit of writing   and damn old and damned influential too  The writing is lively  well  it is in this verse translation anyway   my ancient Greek isn t quite up to the job of the original  and is brilliant when it s dwelling on the bitchiness of the Gods or actual plot     rather less so when it s simply running through the owners of the ships   Yo  Anyone from Cephalonia in the house    or listing for the umpteenth time the full and detailed lineage of the man Diomedes is about to behead I also found it amusing that you could do any old crap and blame a god for it   oh  I ve not been unfaithful dear  the father s a river   the west wind   a shower of almond blossom   Thus Agamemnon wasn t a dick when he took Achilles  stolen woman  he was made mad by a Fury  Aeneas didn t turn tail and run away  he was whisked up by a passing God and hidden in a veil of dust and placed out of harms way  So  an influential tale  well told  but those olden day heroes weren t that heroic   just bloodthirsty  merciless cocks  The Grand Daddy of all epic tales I had never read the Iliad before now  and since it was assigned to me in my current college course  I really had no choice but to embrace it  What a great read  I knew most of the storyline of course through general knowledge of mythology and Greek legend and also  though I cringe a little to say it  from the film  Troy  If you haven t read the Iliad and fancy yourself a fan of legend or fantasy novels  I would highly recommend it  For those out there who aren t purists and want a version that is very easily read and understood  I would stick to the Stanley Lombardo translation over all others  Lombardo has a way of translating the text in such a way that uses more modern language and terms and makes the text much easier to follow than most other translations of older texts that I have attempted to read As for the story itself  it is filled with action  adventure  war  love  the meddling and politics of the Gods themselves and a great deal more  Achilles is the star of the show so to speak  but I found myself rooting more for Patroclus  Hector and several others as I read through the text  There are a score of likable and detestable characters that all stand out in their own way  Truly a fun read and one that I wish that I had read earlier as I m sure that it gets better upon subsequent readings  Note  I have read a very abridged version of The Iliad Uff  now that I got it off m chest  Let s talk Iliad  nerds  Before I picked up this epic poem  I was as frightened as a little girl because I know how hard it is both in language and plot  it s full of war  bloody wars  men killing each other for the sake of a stolen girlfriend  the battles are described in long  I mean long  pages  and women here never fail to ruin things  So while reading it  expect your adrenalin to get so high  it may hurt your nerves  As soon as I started reading the book  though  I started to adapt to it  in terms of language  I struggled and crumbled  but the internet is always near for further explanation  also  it isworth the trouble  Of course  not to forget how sexy the Greeks are  Achilles is a hot badass and women here are either girlfriends or whinnies  one of the characters has a Stockholm Syndrome  Briseis  Geez  I loved that  unless they are goddesses who actually get to do things  So  I am not going to write any feminist indignation  Summing up  it s a crazy gory epic  has quite good romance  and the language would make suffer for its beauty    and yes it s difficulty  but it is worth it  Review taken from my blog  The Haunting of Orchid Forsythia  http   hauntedorchid blogspot com 201    Story I ve actually read The Iliad once before made it my summer camping at the beach read one year  Admittedly  I thought it was good but not  Oh my gosh  this book is awesome  good  The actual story of the Trojan War is what makes this such an interesting book  but most especially  the way that it is written as an account of who was there and and their ties to the fighting  I like that fact that Homer gives such detail to the characters of the book and their personal histories  Usually I do not like books to have a lot of character history  but it is done so well in The Iliad and necessary that one can not help but be drawn in  The Iliad is definitely one of the most epic books I have ever read  as well  as one of the bloodiest books because Homer does not hold anything back from his descriptions of the pains of war and all the mess involved in one  While the descriptions of the battle could be graphic at times with the death wounds dealt the story does not linger on those scenes  Rather it is more of a dry report of how a certain character died  yet still perhaps a little too violent for some The Iliad is one of those books were the characters are not ones that I could necessarily love  While I may not think to fondly of the characters and their actions  I do think that each of their stories are quite captivating as they struggle for what they want in their world against the  gods  who meddle in day to day life  The characters for me  are just that   characters  The one thing that really made them interesting was that they were all extremely flawed  from Paris and his cowardice  to Achilles and his refusal to fight because he was offended by the loss of his prize  a girl   as for the gods themselves  I really cannot think of anything good to say about them  For me  they were an annoyance in their pettiness  but ya ll can see more of why I don t like them below  The one thing that really sticks out in my mind when I think back on The Iliad would have to be well  at least this translation of it is that I found myself thinking differently about a certain character which surprised me  After listening to the introduction by Stephen Mitchell  I found myself looking beyond my initial thoughts about Helen and the situation that she found herself in  And this time  I actually felt bad for her instead on contempt because while she did mess up in running off with Paris she tried near the end to gain back some of the her lost dignity by refusing him  The first time through I just got hung up on the whole she ran off with another man not her husband  and caused the beginning of a war that lasted ten years  The one thing I still do not like about The Iliad would have to be the gods and goddess of Olympus  My biggest gripe against the gods would have to be that they are selfish  petty  self serving  manipulative  and a bunch of babies  Yeah  I do not think to highly of their characters in the book and that is most likely to never change  I could seriously go on and on about how annoyed they made me  but I am pretty sure that would get boring real fast for ya ll  Narration While I was really interested in listening to the audio version of The Iliad  I was not all too sure that any one would be able to breath enough life into the book that would hold ones attention  Which is why I am happy to say that Alfred Molina did a fantastic job reading The Iliad  He absolutely astounded me with his ability to capture the story and the characters so perfectly What really made this a great listen was the reader  Alfred Molina  So if you think The Iliad is maybe not something you would be interested in reading  I would recommend listening to the audio because it will absolutely pull you in and leave you listening long after you should be asleep The only drawback to the audio  besides the length of time  would have to be the introduction  Its not the the information was not good and useful for the book it was just kind of dull   especially the way it was read  I am not trying to be mean  but the author  while doing an excellent job of adding depth the story  did not exactly have the best reading voice  Final Verdict  The Iliad  definitely one epic listen or read The Iliad earns 4 out of 5 pineapples   The Iliad is an epic story of war and vengeance  intermixed with the mischievous drama of mythic deities  Samuel Butler has done an outstanding job translating an almost three thousand year old epic poem into an easily readable story  What emerges is a story of human and divine conflict that is both inspiring and stomach turning  Whereas in modern times our stories must always justify any display of gratuitous violence with some traumatic event or morbid fear of annihilation which inspires the protagonist to destroy their enemies  the characters of the Iliad and its writer show no such obligation to bring the reader along in empathy with them  While even the Spartan characters of the popular movie  300  were fighting for a cause which many modern civilized people can empathize with  the Greek and Spartan warriors needed little justifiable cause to wage war  Contrary to the way the characters are depicted in the movie  Troy   this book is  not surprisingly  much better   the Greek warriors are not fighting out of fearful obligation to a cruel and powerful dictator  The high king of Greece himself asked several times if he should just turn them all back home and forget this campaign  but minor kings and warriors alike rebuked him each time and inspired him to stay the course out of their own general desire to achieve victory together War in this story was a lifestyle men were glad to take up and victory over their opponents was satisfaction almost in and of itself  Men gained prowess through their skill in battle and the strongest  most skilled warriors ruled their clans and were usually first into the fray  seeking to take down the strongest warriors themselves  Men pillaged and increased status and wealth through sacking cities and carrying off their women and goods  Often they would capture more well to do warriors if they knew their relatives on neighboring islands cities would offer ransom to see them returned alive  but more often they simply killed a man on the battlefield and tore off their armor  for both the monetary value of the precious metal and the bragging rights as a trophy and proof of having killed an able bodied man   Without this driving  business  of wealth and increasing one s status through skill  hard work  and loyalty  how else would these kings be able to keep their clans of thousands of warriors inline and inspired over a ten year campaign whose instigating cause was nothing more than the stealing of another man s wife  Also absent from most current film adaptations is the interplay of the Olympian deities  an integral part of this work  Perhaps we feel we ve outgrown our appreciation for Greek gods the way we outgrow Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy  so film makers simply omit the story s reference to them  The Iliad presents a world where the interaction with the deities is a day to day reality and that alone should stimulate the imagination and have some entertainment value  Man is subject to the power of the gods yet the gods are compelled by their prayers and sacrifices  creating a symbiotic relationship that adds both intrigue and drama to the story  Some gods favor the Trojan army  others the Greeks and there is a hierarchy of power and politics among them such that they cannot always intervene outright and must often tip the scales in their favor secretly  Wrapped within this drama perhaps is a representation of some functional  archetypal role these gods play  however it s not as prevalent as in other depictions of Greek myths  these gods more just pick their favorites and either directly or vicariously compete against each other  The level of gore and descriptive violence in the Iliad rivals anything we can produce in our most disturbing horror films and would not pass MPAA standards if ever faithfully adapted from the book  The warriors of the Iliad are violent as expected for their profession as soldiers  but when one of them is angered by an injustice committed against them or avenging a friend  even the gods of the rivers themselves cry out and rise against them to scale back the carnage  Nietzsche comments on this mean streak Thus the Greeks  the most humane men of ancient times  have a trait of cruelty  a tigerish lust to annihilate  a trait that is also very distinct in that grotesquely enlarged mirror image of the Hellenes  in Alexander the Great  but that really must strike fear into our hearts throughout their whole history and mythology  if we approach them with the flabby concept of modern  humanity The Iliad is a story either partly or fully mythical when civilization came at the cost of and hand in hand with conquering armies of bloodthirsty warriors  The traits which have become tame in most of those in the modern world run wild and without apology or justification on the battlefields of Troy  And even in such an appalling presentation of rage and raw domination  an aesthetically appealing story has emerged  The good thing about this translation is its readability  It reads like a novel  Of course  Homer s original version was a poem  so if you are a purist  this version may be missing something for you  This is the first version I ve read cover to cover  but I ve read parts of several others  and honestly  some of the rhyming  I m thinking of the Pope version  got a little annoying after a while  Now about the Iliad in general  I like the story  I still have a long ways to go before I really understand that culture  For instance  why is everyone so obsessed with stripping off the armor of their conquered foes  I guess armor was probably hard to come by  unless your mother is a goddess and she can just hop over to Hephaestus and ask for a custom set   so I can see wanting to stockpile it or grab some if it s better than what you ve got  but why not strip the bodies later  Why do it on the battlefield  And I don t mean to criticize such an ancient story  but I would have liked it better if fewer things were controlled incited by the immortals  I don t even want to call them gods because they are so different than my understanding of the divine  Homer s gods are petty  vicious  shallow  unforgiving  full of bad human characteristics magnified  Maybe they re the comic relief  How can anyone review the Iliad  Homer s epic poem  translated by Robert Fitzgerald  is 500 plus pages of dactylic hexameter  Along with the Bible  Homer s Iliad and Odyssey are the hallmarks of western literature  So how does one review the book that really started it all  I m not sure myself  It might even be sacrilegious to criticize a staple of the high school English curriculum Homer s epic is only a glimpse at the conflict that spans several books and authors  the Trojan War  It s the final year of the war  and King Agamemnon still can t convince prince Achilles to join the fight against Troy  Instead of joining his comrades in arms  Achilles sits at his tent all day  plays his Lute  and complains about how Agamemnon screwed him over in gifts and spoils of war  Meanwhile  the gods have chosen their sides in the conflict  Ever opportunistic and fickle  the gods support whatever side they feel has burned enough at their altars of worship  Achilles non involvement and the Apollo s and Ares support of the Trojans  creates a desperate situation for the Achaeans  Even the possible destruction of their ships  and pleading from the master commanders Odysseus and Diomedes  can not sway the lute playing Achilles  It is only Patroclus  Achilles  best friend  possible lover  who convinces Achilles to loan him his armor and attack the Trojans  Only after Patroclus s death at the hands of Hector does Achilles feel motivated to attack  The climax of the story  is Achilles  no embodiment of wrath  slaughtering Trojan after Trojan in his quest to end Hector s life  After Achilles kills Hector  he drags his body through field of battle behind his chariot  and lets the dogs try to eat his face  cold blooded  In the end  Achilles reconciles with Hector s father  the king of Troy  Priam and lets him have the body back  Homer ends his epic tale there  rather than with the fall of Troy  Homer s portrayal of the Greek Gods in the Iliad is different from their representations in Greek religious observance  Sure  Poseidon still controls the seas  Zeus is still king of the Gods  Athena and Ares are still representations of warfare  However  Homer uses the gods as a means to explain the Trojan War  Their fickle and opportunistic nature  do not appear God like and at time  they act like children endowed with super powers  that complain when they can t have their way  The Gods are not all noble  understanding  and compassionate  They switch sides  route on their team for personal pride  and act when they feel like it  It s almost as if Homer is saying that the God s are to be worshiped not for their inherent qualities and benevolence  but rather it s better to have some high powered individuals playing for your team  Homer s themes in the Iliad have created the foundation for western literature  Wrath destroys everyone including the person from which it springs forth  Achilles is the embodiment of wrath  mindlessly destroying Trojans  and desecrating Hector s body  all for the purpose of inflicting as much pain as he is feeling regarding Patroclus s death  It s this wrath that will ultimately destroy him  Homer uses Odysseus as the foil  his cleverness and ability to reserve his emotions does not damn him to the same fate as Achilles  The concept of respect and honor through combat emerges out of the Iliad  Never have I read more brutal lines about spears and swords cutting through skulls  appendages and vertebra then in Homer s poem  He seems to argue that through war and strife  we become something greater than ourselves  something that is almost god like  Lastly  the idea of fate  guides the narrative of the Iliad  The fate of Achilles  Hector  and Paris is foretold by the gods  However  it is their actions that have determined their fate  they have chosen their fate  which I believe is hallmark of western literature This question of reviewing a classic comes back full circle  As if I was fated to talk about it  The Iliad is a classic  I can t really review a classic  What can I say  Homer s poem has a great melody  but I can t really dance to it  Two thumbs up  It would cheapen it  Its importance lies in its ability to escape the dustbin of history  Who am I to criticize and complain about a piece of literature that has been around since the time of Ancient Greece and still remains relevant today  Kudos Homer  you really wrote a doozy  The Iliad was a slow read for me  I don t know if it was because of the translator  or the story  or a bit of both  but I just seemed to slog along in the book  I am not saying it was bad  or even boring  but it just was a slow read for me  In the end I am glad I read it  seeing how it is a basic building block for Western literature and culture A few things surprised me  The war had been going on for 10 years before the book takes up the story  I had no idea  That Paris must have been totally smitten by Helen to put up with constant war waged on his land for that long The gods were active in the battle  to the point a few times they were out there in the middle  fighting  Some gods were pro Greek  other pro Trojan  so they d square off  trying to help their side win  Until Zeus told them to knock it off  then they d try to figure a way around Zeus  commandment without offending the big guy The book ends with Hector s funeral  No Trojan Horse  no death of Achilles  no fall of Troy  Not much  in fact  of any of the stories I thought were in there  Those events are referred to in The Odyssey  mostly by Odysseus   O GODDESS sing what woe the discontentOf Thetis  son brought to the Greeks  what soulsOf heroes down to Erebus it sent Leaving their bodies unto dogs and fowls Whilst the two princes of the army strove King Agamemnon and Achilles stout  Surprisingly good for a 3000 year old  book   I don t think anyone would want to read this in a prose version  only a poetic translation could ever do justice to this  Although I assume it would be better enjoyed if you had a bard to sing it for you  Looking forward to reading the Odyssey  4 5 Ever since childhood I have been fascinated with Greek mythology and this book  while it may be a little challenging to read at times  is completely worth it  I love how the gods and goddesses are so present and accessible to people like Achilles when he talks to his mother who is a goddess  and also how much the book tells about how gods intervene and co mingle with normal humans  This is a very special book that must be experienced at some point in any persons life who either likes Greek mythology or history from around this time   I always thought The Part About the Crimes of Bolano s 2666 had a literary predecessor in the midsection of Homer s Iliad  with each man named and described in his pose of death  both passages are fearsomely unrelenting in their depiction of wasted life  and both almost equally hard to complete in their own way  In Homer the dozens of appellations that begin to bleed into each other give you that quote from Baudelaire  which one might amend    a desert  of horror in a desert of boredom  The memorable moments are too many to describe  the fire of those first lines  the great Achilles brooding  Patroclus s unforgettable deed  Achilles mourning its aftermath  the magnificent microcosm shield of Hephaestus  Achilles s rage    Thousands of years on this book can make you tremble  And that s something PS    great translation  both modern and ancient  incredibly beautiful and accessible  It s a classic  what else is there to say  I finally read it after somehow not being required to in all my schooling I found the nonchalant description of the gore and violence a little startling at first  I guess I didn t really expect it  I generally don t mind that sort of thing  but it didn t really help I seemed to mostly read about brains splattering the insides of helmets and entrails hanging out while I was eating lunch Other than that  this particular translation was quite nice  Modern English that was easy to get through  Although  as this is only the first time  only translation I have ever read I don t really have a standard to compare it to All in all  I enjoyed it  Of course it was also helpful in realizing references in other texts I may not have understood previously  My favorite of the Greek mythical tales  I love the dynamic between Hector and Achilles  Actually  the film  Troy  captured this tale almost to the letter and was very well done   Re reading this with particular attention to  what we talk about when we talk about war   The motivations  the experience of  regrets about  whether and how much standing in the shoes of the enemy  4 njmt fqT ljml llG  lty stkhdmh

does a wonderful job of putting things plainly  I read this in companionship to a free Kindle version that was a little more lyrical  I do wish I had also read the Lattimore version  but one can only read the same thing so many times in a given period of time  so perhaps another day  Though my recommendation for others is to read this along with Lattimore or Pope  that is if you want a more lyrical  or poetic version  I would not have understood the lyrical version I had as well  if I hadn t read the Rouse version first  I don t know about you but I want to read The Odyssey just to watch Achilles die   Wenn man erstmal anfangt  lasst es einen nicht mehr los     Tut gut mal wieder einen Klassiker zu lesen  D For real  this is the goriest  most graphically violent book I ve ever read  by a factor of about ten  And  shockingly  one of the most surprisingly enjoyable   none of that stiff  bloodless appreciation  either  It s just flat out a fun read  I don t know jack about translating Ancient Greek  but Stanley Lombardo has done a pretty incredible job of bringing out the punchy  gritty  pungent style of the Iliad in fresh  modern language without detaching it from its roots in an ancient   and very  very  foreign   culture  This book is tons o  fun  This is a great translation  very easy to read  still poetic  It is the Iliad   it is a must read  I am glad I read it finally  It is obviously a very violent story  but important part of our classic literature  I took a break for a while because I didn t want to read the end  but I came back and finished  I read about 2 3 of the intro after I finished  which I really enjoyed because it analyzed and commented on some of the plot points and characters  I definitely recommend reading the introduction but AFTER reading the book   it drags along in the end doesn t it    worth the accomplishment though  This is a great story  Sure  it s a classic  but so many classics feel too much like work to be read for entertainment as well as personal enrichment  Stanley Lombardo s translation made all the difference for me  and the text design by Dan Kirklin made the verses a pleasure to read   Frankly  I have tried to read the Iliad before  but got hung up on stilted English with way too many lines crammed onto each page  By sheer coincidence  I had already been chipping away at the Iliad s 24 books for several weeks when I read Robert J  Sawyer s www watch and then www wake  which deal with topic of consciousness  Sawyer recalls a controversial book of a few decades ago  The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind  in which Julian Jaynes cites the Iliad as a kind of proof that consciousness as we think of it today was not a common feature of life at the time of the sack of Troy  There is almost no evidence of introspection in the Iliad  It s all  he did this  she did that  the god talked to him and gave him power  or the god turned away from the other and he died  The poet seems to be neutral as he tells of heroes on both Greek and Trojan sides  and how they prevailed or met their deaths  The gods are very much in evidence throughout the epic  Although most of the gods have favorites in the struggle  only a few engage personally in the fighting  When a warrior wins his battle  he assumes that he had the help of a god  and most warriors wisely praise the immortals to ensure their continued help  I hope to read the Iliad again  perhaps trying a different translation  after reading Prof  Lombardo s translations of the Odyssey and the Aenead  This classic poem of heroism  pride  and pettiness centers around Achilles  sulky anger and the resulting carnage in the final year of the Trojan War  stopping short of the infamous Trojan Horse   It is a brutal  gory war story well worth reading I have read the translations by Robert Fagles and Richmond Lattimore  and am not sure which I prefer  Both are verse translations that avoid using archaic English  with Fagles  English being a bit too modern colloquial for my taste on occasion   Lattimore s verse is in a more consistent hexameter than Fagles  but also has a tendency to put line breaks right in the middle of clauses which Fagles avoids  In the editions that I read  Fagles had twice as much introductory matter as Lattimore as well as a dozen pages of endnotes  Lattimore has none   Fagles  notes provided some helpful background information  but also tended to expound his own interpretation of the themes and meaning of the poem  which I personally find annoying   Overall  I would recommend either one as a decent translation of this great epic  The book  The Iliad  was one of the most challenging books I have ever read but that doesn t mean that it was not enjoyable  The book begins with Chryses  a priest of Apollo begging the great king Agamemnon to return his daughter Chryseis who had just been captured by Agamemnon and his men after they raided a Trojan Allied town  Chryseis was taken as Agamemnon s prize and Bryseis was taken as Achilles s prize  After failing to obtain his daughter  Chryses prays to the god Apollo and Apollo strikes the Achaean ships with disease  After doing so  Agamemnon has and argument with Achilles who actually wanted to return Chryseis to her father to stop the madness so Agamemnon returns her and instead takes Bryseis from Achilles  Achilles runs away crying to his mom Thetis and then she goes and talks to Zeus  He ends up sending Agamemnon a fake dream leading him to the dangerous city of Troy thinking that he can actually successfully win a battle  But the twist is that Zeus actually tells the Trojans of the attack and the Trojans prepare for war with their strong defenses  Then a few things happen between Paris and Menelaus  Skipping over to when the Achaens are losing to the Trojans because the gods are on the Trojan s side  Agamemnon weeps saying that he is a failure but then tries to persuade Achilles to come back and fight with him after hearing that only Achilles can save the Achaeans from destruction  But Achilles relents and instead  he sends his dearest friend Patroclus to fight help fight the Trojans wearing his armor  Although he is a good warrior  he still ends up dead by the hands of Hector with a little help from Apollo  filled with grief from the death of his best friend  Achilles storms into the raging war bringing with him the intent to kill Hector  Achilles  suited in new outfit because Hector took his from Patroclus   goes on a killing spree  One after another  the Trojan army is handicapped greatly by the wrath of one wronged man  Soon after  Achilles manages to easily slaughter Hector and unsatisfied with his revenge  he drags his body around Patroclus s grave everyday for nine days  Horrified with the sight of their dead son being degraded on such a high level  Hectors parents request that Achilles lay off and return Hector to them  Achilles agrees and returns him  The book ends with a funeral dedicated to the great warrior Hector  Overall I believe that this is a good book but it is very fast pace and requires a lot of deep reading to understand it s story  but once you read the end  you will feel very accomplished and have a larger respect for ancient poetry   Okay let s just say that this book had me on my toes digging in the ground  lol  I mean it was very extensive and challenging to me  The poetry about Greek Gods and war heroes gives me a lost moment sometime and I m trying to follow thru  I felt distressed and sometime over whelmed when I was reading this for my class  It was well written I must say but  lord I needed some energy to maintain going on with the reading  Homer did an exceptional good job of writing this poem describing the story about the Trojan War  Throughout the whole story  I wanted to be a Trojan solider myself lol  I felt the hunger of war and the test to have my name remembered like great ones of that particular time  Maybe  my name could have been something like Gail  princess warrior who fought for women  The Trojan War in this story was described as revenge among rivals and what Gods are in favor of certain warriors  This makes the book more like watching the actual movie of Troy  The Iliad was a little difficult for me to read and to follow at times but it was enjoyable   The Iliad is one of Homer s epic poems that tells the tale of war  heroes  and divine help  The poem tells the story of a war going on between the Trojans and the Achaeans  After Nine years of war  Achilles   the Achaean army s greatest warrior   has a quarrel with Agamemnon   the leader of the Achaean Army   over a maiden that he claimed when they sacked the town of Chryse  This quarrel led to Achilles leaving the army for a while and asking his divine mother Thetis the sea nymph if she could somehow get revenge for him and get his honour back  Thetis replies that she will do everything she can and she will consult Zeus  King of the Gods  for he owed her a favor  Now that the Gods are involved in the conflict things get worse  The achaeans get defeated in battle and realize how bad they are without the help of Achilles  From then on it all goes downhill for the Achaeans  Troy  and Achilles  I believe that the purpose of this tale is to remind us that everyone has a weakness whether it be a strong strong and noble warrior  or a strong undefeated army  I really enjoyed this book because I m really into greek mythology and I really liked the fact that the gods would help the humans but they would take sides  The gods weren t in agreement with each other and partly this caused the many downfalls that happened in this epic  But again the main message in my opinion was that everyone has a weakness  I recommend this book to people who are into greek mythology and who like long epic poems  It may take some time to understand some parts of the poem and you might need to look up some references that at the time don t make sense  Overall this was a great book and I enjoyed it   This translation is the best one I ve had the pleasure of dipping into I will confess I didn t read the whole thing  and in fact have not read all the way through any translation  I did do one class on Homeric Greek many years ago and had the opportunity to explore many ways of bringing this epic to modern English  This is the first one I read where the form and structure of the individual lines has been brought into modern English in a way that any reasonably literate English speaker can easily understand the drama that is being presented  This version of the initial argument between Achilles and Agamemnon somehow reads so well that I could easily visualize the scene of the two of them standing there insulting each other  bringing the whole war effort into question If you ve never got around to reading the Iliad due to the difficulty of being able to get into it like one does a novel  this translation is for you  Even though it also preserves the presentation of a singer and poet that probably does reflect the way Homer sang it  ponderous and solemn  but fun and exciting If I ever get around to finishing it  five stars    The Iliad of Homer  1951   7th century BCE Richmond Lattimore  1906 1984    Homer   750 650 ish BCE  Epic poem with intro and notes by Richard Martin

and death in a dark mist closed in about him Reminds me of  a little the Song of Roland  I guess  If there were less reverence and more highlighting of the insanity of it all  why not toss in Michael Herr s Dispatches  I am not actually reading the Fagles translation  but the 1950 one by E V  Rieu  Penguin Classics L14  1972 printing  FULL DISCLOSURE  This translation consists of 469 pages  Homer was a great poet  His descriptions  especially of war and battle  are breathtaking  However  I have two issues with the Iliad  One is a misconception  the other a modern problem  The misconception is that this story covers the Trojan War  While yes  the Trojan War is the backdrop  The Iliad neither begins nor ends the Trojan War  It is merely one chapter  beginning with Achilles and Agamemnon arguing  and ending with Hector s funeral  No kidnapping of Helen  No Trojan Horse  Sorry  Obviously  this is not Homer s fault  It s my misconception  but I did find it off putting  The modern problem  on the other hand  has to do with feminism and anti slavery  and modern notions of how people should treat people  Bottom line  the gods are jerks  the heroes are jerks  unless you are a queen or goddess  all women are property or trophies or simply nothing  Even men  aren t all that important unless they are Princes or half gods  I understand that these things existed historically  but it does dampen some of the enjoyment  Also explains why I was disappointed not to get to read about Achilles  death  despite the fact The Iliad goes out of its way to note its inevitability  That part happens after The Iliad   Technically  I listened to rather than read this  But  Dan Stevens  yes  that Dan Stevens  was right  It is much better listened to  particularly when he is doing the reading  The book  an epic poem attributed to Homer  covers a period of a few months in the final year of a 10 year battle between Troy  Illium  and a confederation of Greek states in the midst of an argument between Achilles and Agamemnon  Apparently the Greeks were ticked off that Paris of Troy kidnapped Helen from her husband  King Menelaus of Sparta  That s the simple explanation  Naturally  it s more complicated than that because Greek gods are involved  The book is gorier than anything you ll find in a George R R  Martin novel  and the continually listing of who was stabbed and killed by a spear  and exactly how  could get kind of tedious if you read it  but listening made it easier to bear  The Iliad is one of the oldest known pieces of literature and I m not sure it s comforting to know how little has changed in all these years  Leaving aside the constant squabbling between the gods  the humans could be extremely vicious and vindictive  showing overwhelming grief when a loved one is killed in battle but absolutely no compassion for those who were also losing loved ones on the  enemy  side  This is shown most clearly in the tale of Hector s death by Achilles  Neither were very nice guys on the battlefield although Hector  of Troy  was well loved by his people  It s really too complicated to summarize  but I am glad I took the time to hear this classic  Next  The Odyssey  El destino de los seres humanos es el sufrimiento y la muerte    Let me not then die ingloriously and without a struggle  but let me first do some great thing that shall be told among men hereafter   This epic Greek poem has been continuously read for two and a half millennia  which is why The Iliad has ever been in my to read pile  In some ways  the work shows its age  Calling some sections tedious is to be kind  The petty and jealous gods turn the tide of battle first this way and then that  It feels like the Olympians are used to explain why some fighter can suddenly find the strength to kill dozens or a how a whole group either gains courage or loses heart in the midst of the fight Throughout there are cleverly turned phrases  thanks to both the original text and translator  worth discovering  By the final book  this great work extolling the honor won in war ends with touching grief  Not an anti war poem by any stretch as Homer seems to take war for granted as a part of being human  But through Hector s father Priam and wife Andromache  we see something of the human cost of the glory of battle This story of a few tragic weeks in a decade long war is woven into the fabric of western literature  While not easy  the work as a whole is worth the effort  Or do like my wife and I did and cheat  We listened to Downton Abbey s Dan Stevens  masterful reading  He brought the text alive and even powered us through the parts that wanted to bog down  This work was made to be heard  The Iliad works brilliantly as an audio book  A ponderous read  Though the story is captivating the writing is difficult to get adjust to  I read this when I was in high school and I struggled with the language till the end More importantly it expects the reader to have some basic knowledge of Greek gods and general mythology  Character backgrounds are not given  People who know nothing of Greek mythology would find it quite difficult to read this  None the less  for sheer splendor that is the story  I give it 4 stars   Un libro que me gusto bastante y que me permitio salir de un bloqueo lector  antes de que este se alargara demasiado La fascinante historia de la guerra de Troya  contada por un narrador omnisciente  permite que esta sea admirada en todo su esplendor  Me gusto la experiencia de leer esta version adaptada LUEGO de leer  La Cancion de Aquiles  de Madeline Miller  un re telling de la historia en cuestion   ya que me permitio contemplar los sucesos de dicho libro desde otra perspectiva en este  lo que aclaraba muchas cosas A pesar de que me gusto bastante  encontre alguna que otra parte que podria haber sobrado y que hizo un poco mas larga la historia Sin lugar a dudas es un clasico que muchos deberian leer  ya sea en su version original o en una adaptada  Aunque yo elegi una version mas corta porque mi interes era simplemente tener una idea de lo que contaba la novela  considero que ambas alternativas permitirian que el lector

worth a try at several levels  First the sheer beauty of the story telling  Second  the characters  oh the volumes and volumes of characters Homer has introduced  Third  the detailing  Written in verses  very few words speak to you long stories  I might be too naive to say I know Greek mythology now but I know how the term  Greek Tragedy  came into being for sure  Reread  Still as good as I remembered  Read it years ago in my mid teens because I was so into Greek Mythology and I just wanted to read the story about Odysseus  Achilles  Hector  Aeneas  You need a good translation and want to read epic poetry if you want to enjoy it  I found little things I didn t know or remembered  Reading it along side a non fiction on the Trojan war and Marion Zimmer Bradley s Firebrand just made the text look and sound even better   Brad Pitt gets mad and kills lots of Trojans More or less  The Iliad  by Homer is an amazing feat of the letters  and more if we take into account that it was written almost 3000 years ago  And if you want no other reason  take this one  that a huge book  around 1000 pages in the Spanish version I read  about a few warriors fighting and killing each other  feels breezy and is fun  and only drags a little bit in parts  That you can read  or listen to  to 24 quite long parts of people menacing each other  showing off  and Homer constantly repeating that they are all amazing fighters  loved by the gods  etc etc  and not get tired  is a feat by itself The book has the most basic  and widely known  stories  Handsome Paris has  stolen  Helen from Menelaus  her first husband  enraging the Greeks  who to go to Troy with revenge in their minds  The gods  in general  believe Troy should be destroyed  even if some of them are in favor of the Trojans  Apollo  for example  So after a weird introduction  Achilles getting into an argument with Agamemnon because of a girl and deciding to sit the fight out  and his mother going to Zeus and demanding that the Greeks should be pushed close to defeat till they ask for Achilles s forgiveness  to which Zeus agrees   the fight starts  And we have fights  And fights  And fights  And more fights  With lots of similes  amazingly ludicrous examples and comparisons and as much tomfoolery as possible  Wait till characters stop in the middle of a fight to speak to each other for five or six pages  telling each other about random stuff  It all becomes a little bit repetitive at the umpteenth simile about a fighter being like a lion  or when you read the new comparison between the situation a fighter is in and the one a boar is when it is surrounded by humans and dogs But Homer  or whoever glued the story  has a knack for the fantastic and epic  Because this is fantasy and epic at its best  The action is amazing  the characters human  even if cruel to the last   the gods are cool  and even if it has some cheap decisions  making a god appear to take from the battle a character who is close to die   that is part of the charm  and the idea of the story  that gods became human like and human became like gods It s a blast  even if we don t have Brad Pitt in it  Achilles is better  And Ajax  Diomedes  Odysseus  Nestor   9 10 No one said that the Iliad would be an easy read  and it s not  The language used is  at times  archaic and the structure of the story itself is not something that modern readers will be accustomed to  Epic poems are an extreme rarity in modern times  However  none of that could detract me from an interesting and exciting story  It s a war story  it s a personal story  it s a story of defiance and greed  There is a lot going on in The Iliad and I wonder why we never read it in school  We read The Odyssey  a sequel to this story  but we never got around to The Iliad  I have never seen it performed on stage  but I have heard many good things about those adaptations  The story is an epic and it is thrilling  Homer pioneered many stylistic choices and structural flares that lived long beyond his years  In the end  though  The Iliad is simply a great story and one that is worth your time and attention  I read The Iliad in high school and to be honest I was confused throughout the whole book  It was not until we discussed it in class that I began to understand what was happening  I decided to give it another read and I loved it  The way it is written can be a bit confusing but with guidance it becomes a lot easier  This is probably not a book I would reread for fun The book tells the story of the Trojan War fought between the Trojans and the Greeks  Achaeans   The main characters of this book are Achilles  Hector  Paris  Helen  Agamemnon  Briseis and the Gods This is definitely a book I would have my class read and them have a class discussion to make sure everyone knows what is going on because I know this book can be a bit confusing  This book is intended for high school students  There are many activities that can be done after the novel which would further help students understand the novel  I really love Homer and Greek Mythology  That being said The Iliad is not my favorite work involving either  I just don t consider it as entertaining or as useful for trying to decipher the riddle of Indo European religious beliefs and practices as other sources  Its still something you should read if you have an interest in the subject matter and is still a pretty good yarn as far as entertainment value  If you want to read a book that is all about war  and really nothing else but war  then The Iliad is the book for you  Now when people say it s an epic poem  they really mean epic  This entire novel is about guys who are fighting guys that all die because mister steal your girl came in and took another dude s chick  On a positive note  I will say that there is enough detailed gore to keep you reading  The continuous battles and wars that happen are actually all different that are very intriguing to read  The ongoing plot of war really never gets old  One minute you ll say to yourself   Oh golly  another battle   but once you re done reading it  you ll say to yourself   Whoa  that was cool  The characters are Greek gods and goddesses which makes it quite interesting to see them either fight with each other or fight against each other  For future reference to people that haven t read this book  I would recommend you get to know your Greek gods and goddesses  because it will come in handy when they randomly show up in a battle The setting is based in the city of Troy  an ancient city in Turkey  Battles are fought all around the city  as well as it s environs  In my opinion this is a great setting for this book because their are a lot of rural areas Homer s word choice and his ways that he writes can be very hard to read and understand sometimes  Every now and then I would have to reread certain sections just so I could see in my head what was going on  Once I did understand what was happening  I thought the section was very interesting Overall I definitely recommend this book  If you re into that intense war and nothing else  this book is perfect  Other than some of the confusing mumbo jumbo that Homer writes  this book is very fun to read and keeps you hooked to read more  NOTE  This review pertains specifically to the audiobook performance  I m not qualified to judge the relative quality or merits of a particular translation from ancient Greek  so I can t say whether as a translation Fitzgerald s version is better or worse than any other scholar s I ve been a fan of ancient mythology since I was very young  and I ve read many different versions of The Iliad in verse and prose throughout my life as well as seen several different movies based on the epic poem and its companion  The Odyssey  This is the first time I ve simply listened to it  and I was highly impressed Narrator Dan Stevens does a fantastic job of replicating the tones  rhythms  and modulations of many different voices and sound effects throughout the entire 11 disc reading  Often  his capable narration of the voluminous boastfests and countless bloody battles  dizzying in the variety of graphic violence and grisly deaths presented  transported me in ways the movies never have  As Stevens read  I could hear the clanging of armor and thudding of bodies as warriors fell  and I had no trouble visualizing eyes bursting from sockets  teeth flying from shattered jaws  brains oozing from split skulls  and intestines flowing like water from slit bellies during the extended combat scenes  Of course  The Iliad isn t just about mortals boasting and fighting  we re treated to repeated glimpses of gods and goddesses arguing amongst themselves and mortals giving impassioned speeches about honor  duty  and vengeance  Here again Dan Stevens excels at varying his tone  volume  and pace for the different characters  I never had trouble understanding which character was speaking at any given time  I don t know if this production was nominated for a 2014 Audie Award  but it should have at least been longlisted  Dan Stevens was a finalist for solo male narration in 2015 for The Odyssey  and if he wasn t nominated for The Iliad  it s a shame One warning  If copious descriptions of graphic violence and sword and spear melee disturb you  this audiobook isn t for you  But if that doesn t bother you  this is an outstanding way to experience The Iliad the way it was intended for its original audiences in 5th century BCE Greece to experience it   This book is so crucial to Greek  archaic  literature  and almost seems a joke to have to claimed to have been read by just so many people without seeing it s importance  Aside from the daunting idea that this story was originally passed by word  and to attribute so many names to honor in the culture  this story does hold other powerful traits in subject matter of the story Firstly  I need to have a shout out to The Illiad for having contained one of the first instances of romantic dialogue between characters shared  This book is an amazing example of personification of the human psyche by utilization of the Gods of the culture  And lest not us forget my favorite Greek term ate  by which Athena forced Agamemnon s poor choices leading to  temporary insanity  Though if you re reading it  please have no shame skipping a few sections in which they list the various vessels into the war zone to attribute to family names  etc  It s interesting to me that I never have read the Iliad or the Odyssey until now  The beginning is extremely boring  but the payoff is good  Part of the problem is that the intended audience  in BCE Greece  would have known a lot about the Trojan war already  I found that much of what I did know about the Trojan war wasn t even included in the Iliad  It s just a small excerpt from the greater legend  The beginning also is a little lacking because we  as modern civilized folk  don t tend to have the same culture as those ancients  I also read listened to a Great Courses lecture series on the Iliad that helped confirm a lot of what I felt when reading the epic The payoff is good  The story is fairly episodic  and over time you grow accustomed to the pacing of straightforward motive that eventually leads to unbelievably gory bloodshed  Really  some of the graphic descriptions here are more brutal than anything I ve come across in modern literature  You don t quite see it in movies with sword fighting  but Homer  or whoever  really had quite a way with describing steel pushing through body parts  let not my bones be laid apart from yours  Achilles  but with themthe translation in my copy was denying me the gay  embrace it like Homer did   also the lines were not as beautifully translated as I remember reading them in others  When it comes to translated literature  you have to be careful which copy you get a hold of  it really changes a lot   Five excellent Homeric similes using  As    even so  construction 1  As a mountain falcon  swiftest of all birds  swoops down upon some cowering dove   the dove flies before him but the falcon with a shrill scream follows close after  resolved to have her   even so did Achilles make straight for Hector with all his might  while Hector fled under the Trojan wall as fast as his limbs could take him   Book 22 2  As a fire raging in some mountain glen after long drought   and the dense forest is in a blaze  while the wind carries great tongues of fire in every direction   even so furiously did Achilles rage  wielding his spear as though he were a superhuman force  and giving chase to those whom he would slay  till the dark earth ran with blood   Book 20 3  As two swart oxen both strain their utmost at the plow which they are drawing in a fallow field  and the sweat steams upwards from about the roots of their horns   nothing but the yoke divides them as they break up the ground till they reach the end of the field   even so did the two Ajaxes stand shoulder to shoulder by one another   Book 13 4  As when the mighty sea that thunders on the beach when the west wind has lashed it into fury  it has reared its head afar and now comes crashing down on the shore  it bows its arching crest high over the jagged rocks and spews its salt foam in all directions  even so did the serried phalanxes of the Danaans march steadfastly to battle   Book 4 5  As when a man gives a great ox hide all drenched in fat to his men  and bids them stretch it  whereon they stand round it in a ring and tug till the moisture leaves it  and the fat soaks in for the many that pull at it  and it is well stretched   even so did the two sides tug the dead body hither and thither within the compass of but a little space   the Trojans steadfastly set on dragging it into Ilion  while the Achaeans were no less so on taking it to their ships  and fierce was the fight between them   Book 17  i absolutely loved the story  revenge love crazy goddesses what more could you want  but i don t think anyone would be able to read chapter two without falling asleep as it is literally a catalogue of the Greek ships  The Iliad and the Odyssey are the earliest literary works in the European tradition and represent the culmination of a centuries long tradition of orally transmitted poetry The Iliad focuses on events that happened during the last year of the ten year Trojan war which began because of the abduction of Helen from her husband Menelaus to be given as a prize of the most beautiful woman in the world  to Paris of Troy Time  honorKleos  glory or fameXenos  guest  host  friend  stranger or foreignerXenia  the guest host relationshipIt s all because of the women     Paris was gifted with the abducted Helen  wife of Menelaus The Greeks go to war at Troy to get her back Agamemnon gives back the priest s daughter  Chryseis  when requested Then he takes Achilles prize  Briseis Now Achilles won t fight as he has been disrespected And off we go Agamemnon  Apollo is persecuting them because I refused the splendid ransom for the girl Chryseis  And why  Because I wanted to have her at home myself  Indeed  I like her better than my wife Clytamnestra  Chryseis is quite as beautiful and no less clever or skilful with her hands Agamemnon  But here is a threat  in the same way as Phoebus Apollo is robbing me of Chryseis  whom I propose to send off in my ship with my crew  I will come in person to your hut and take away fair cheeked Briseis  your prize  Achilles  to let you know how far I am your superior and to teach others to shrink from claiming parity with me and playing equal to my face The sacred offering of oxen to do honour to the god was quickly set in place round the well built altar  The men rinsed their hands and took up the sacrificial grains       When they had made their prayers and thrown the grain over the victims  they first drew back the animals  heads  slit their throats and skinned them  Then  for the god s portion  they cut out the thigh bones  wrapped them in folds of fat and laid raw meat from the rest of the animal above them  These pieces the old priest burned on wood spits while he poured libations of red wine over them and the young men gathered round him with five pronged forks in their hands  When the God s portion had been consumed by fire  they are the offal and then carved the rest of the victims into small pieces  pierced them with skewers  roasted them carefully and drew them all off When their work was done and the meal prepared  they feasted  and no one went without a share  Their hunger and thirst satisfied  the young men filled the mixing bowls to the brim with wine and went round the whole company  pouring some into each cup for a libation to the god  And for the rest of the day the young Greek warriors sang and danced to appease the god with a beautiful hymn celebrating the archer Apollo  to which he listened with delight Out came the goddess  blood  the ichor that runs in the veins of the blessed gods  who eat no bread and drink no sparkling wine and so are bloodless and called immortals Achilles on losing Patroclus  As it is  you lie mangled here  and my heart rejects all thought of food  Not that I lack it  I lack you Aeneas  You get the kind of answer you have asked for Zeus  For all creatures that breathe and creep about on the earth  there is none so miserable as man God s are immortal  know of death  but do not experience it Animals are mortal  but don t know they are going to die Humans are both mortal and know they must die Dr Elizabeth Vandiver Slow at parts  but well worth it when Achilles finally goes beast mode  Read it with The Odyssey so you can get Homer s contrast of Achilles and Odysseus  One of them wants to find eternal life through glorious death  The other turns down eternal life in order to home to die in peace with his family   A true literature canon  action packed and gruesome throughout  What I find astounding is that this is the oldest piece of surviving work of European literature and although the text has of course been translated  it is clear to see that this is a true masterpiece and should be on everyone s read list   My summary thus far  in two sentences  Agamemnon and Achilles squabble over concubines  Achilles loses  sulks  Achaeans and Trojans begin battle  fueled by Gods  many great sons of great men described  then slaughtered Update  Spiraling cycles of revenge  Many men become heroes  then die gruesomely  After reading and thoroughly enjoying The Odyssey in college  I vowed to read its predecessor and finally came round to it Unfortunately  I did not enjoy The Iliad with the same rapt delight as I did The Odyssey  Perhaps Homer is best read  in parts  with a group who can then share their introspections Reportedly written in the 8th century BC  it is a Greek epic poem written about the battles of the Achaeans and the Trojans during the well known Trojan War  While the writing was surprisingly easy to digest  the multitude of characters was not and the battles  depicted with graphic gore seemed endless Achilles  a brutal and headstrong warrior is merciless and swift in his role in battle  He abhors Agamemnon for taking one of the women he has kidnapped and claimed for his own which creates a festering rift between the two King Agamemnon is self centered and quick to judgment  often to the detriment of his soldiers  He seems unfazed by the carnage around him and seems only to have concern over his own needs Beloved friend to Achilles  Patroclus is extremely devoted to him  yet doesn t share his zealousness for battle  The ties that bind their relationship are known by all which leads to the demise of one Zeus  the king of the Gods seems disinterested in the war and only after his wife Hera s urgings  takes action to intervene  He tries to maintain neutrality and to set the stage for the other gods to do the same  but is convinced by Achilles  mother to support the Trojans A meeting with Homer would surely be delightful  A stroll through modern day Greece would likely prove unnerving so we d steer clear and focus on the mysteries of this famed poet s life  I d love to ask him about his simple  yet lengthy poetic style  Perhaps he could educate a new generation of up and coming bards My rating for The Iliad is a 8 out of 10   Nu om vartannat dar ljod bade jubel och jammer i striden alltsom man stod eller foll  och pa marken flodade bloden Sasom nar  svallande av to

vard att lasa  saval i tystnad som hogt  Introduction and Notes by Bernard KnoxThe introduction is very dry  but the poem  itself  is rich with description and content  In fact  it almost too rich  Every blow  every death  every weapon  every piece of armor is described in excruciating detail  Many time  a brief history of the warrior  his horses  or his armor is also provided  Blood and guts dominate the blow by blow descriptions of the conflict  and the battle seems interminable The translation is truly superb  Robert Fagles does a great job of translating the original Greek into modern English  The ending is anticlimactic  I was expecting a more powerful ending to Homer s epic poem  but it is what it is  I suppose  The book is long  and is not an easy read  IMO  Still    it is worth the effort  Must read to everyone who s interested in ancient Greek civilization  p 84 Let us move Hector to challenge all comers to single combat Holy battles  Batman  The war begins around page 40 and lasts the entire novel  What is more surprising is that the text does not cover the entire engagement  The reader is left with the invaders at the gates  presenting only the battle outside of the city  There is a crazy body count throughout the course of the narrative  Men fight and struggle as the tides of the war go back and forth  showing many noteworthy battles The gods are directly involved in almost aspect of the lives of the characters in the story  Outcomes of the fighting is consistently changed by the interjections of the gods  Later in the story  page 236  the gods join the battle full force  The story is a wild ride and a excellent war story  This book took me forever  But it was definitely worth reading  Exciting  great story telling  LOL moments for me include 1  How there was soooo much uproar over Patroclus   dead  2  Various hoodwinking episodes by the gods3  GODS TAKE SIDES  4  Fighting disagreements bullying amongst the godsAlso  props for making this Greek epic so readable  There is no way that he and I can talk about theseirrelevant things or waste time chatting togetherlike a girl or boy in their love talk  a girl and a boyloving each other s sweet names and whispered endearments     Hector on confronting Achilles My child  you have deserted your favorite human     Zeus to Athena  Ares began by attacking Athena  shaking his huge bronze spearas he bellowed insults  Why are you once again inciting the gods to combat  you nasty bitch     Ares to Athena When Hera saw it  immediately she called to Athena and said  Can you believe it  Look at that  daughter of Zeus There goes the stupid twit through the thick of the battle leading him off the field  Go after her  now  When she heard these words  Athena rushed off  delighted and as she caught up  she punched Aphrodite hardin the breast  she reeled and fell to the ground and tookAres down with her  I listened to the audiobook version of this with translation by Robert Fitzgerald  I enjoyed listening to The Iliad very much  I knew very little about the Trojan War but had seen the movie  Troy   which tells the story with some alterations and without mentioning how the gods interacted with humans   a key element of the story   Dan Stevens  of  Downton Abbey   was an excellent narrator  five stars for his reading   and I don t think I would have gotten as much from the book if I had only read it  Chapter two was particularly uninteresting to me as it was a listing of all the ships and the linage of their Captains who traveled with Agamemnon to Troy  The story itself gave me a better understanding of the Ancient Greeks and their way of life  I will probably listen to this again in the future   A 12 lesson  6 hour  discussion of The Iliad  Elizabeth Vandiver is a jewel of a teacher  I would love to sit in her class  So  next best thing  Teaching company CDs  Thoroughly enjoyed  Now on to the Odyssey  I read the version originally translated by E V  Rieu  later revised and updated by Peter Jones and D C H  Rieu The Illiad wasn t the easiest of reads  The language takes a bit of time to get your head around and a number of characters have the same names I wanted to read it as one of those  I really should read that some day  kind of things and I m glad I did  One of the oldest pieces of fiction in existance  you can see why it stood the passage of time The time period was the biggest suprise for me  I expected the story to run the full ten year war but it actually covers the last month or so I d recommend this to any fantasy fan  Here is the original and worth taking the time   Before I began the book  I thought it would be a dry war story like so many other ancient stories  Soon after starting it though I was pleasantly surprised at the story and how much I enjoyed it and actually felt for the characters  It presents the Trojan war in not a particularly special light  but it shows through its descriptions of the battles and the characters the values that the Greeks and Trojans held most important  like honor and justness  Sometimes the humans themselves seemed even more just than the gods that were portrayed in an almost humorous light  The way the narrator presents the verses as well made it seem very epic indeed  There were very few dry spots  and although there is not much in the way of a relevant theme to my life to take away  the story itself was enjoyable and gave me energy just to read it  Amazing epic Poem  Even if it was for school  I LOVED it   25The Iliad is an epic poem about the Trojan War The Iliad was the first difficult book I read  I even attempted it before I read the Lord of the Rings  I would still to this day consider it to be the most difficult book I have ever read  This is due to how young I was  as well as to the difficult language and length  After a few pages I wanted to throw the book across room  and so I decided to pace myself and only read it while I was at church  therefore making it impossible for me to toss it  I have always been in love with Greek mythology  and so reading about some of my favorite heroes in action was an absolute treat for me  It was also a good precursor for the Odyssey  My favorite part was the Catalog of Ships  or maybe the part where everyone gets a spear through the chin to the back of the neck and then rolls down a hill like a great log  In the book of Iliad there is a ten year war because of a love triangle  pride  a packed made between kings  All over in the book a daughter of a Priest Chryses is stolen and the kidnapper  King Agamemnon refuses to return her  Nine years later of plague on the city  the city demands King Agamemnon gives her back  King Agamemnon will only agree if the trade for her sister  Briseis  Briseis is Achilles  girlfriend once he gives her up  Achilles  the best warrior of Achaeans  stops fighting in hope that others will notice the losses that they need him  Patroklos  Achilles best friend  ask to take his place in war  Approving of Patroklos taking his place in war  gives him his armor  Patroklos in Achilles  armor misguides and terrifies the Trojans  Patroklos dies by the hand of Hector  which enrages Achilles  Achilles wants revenge so he asks for a one on one with Hector  Read to find out who win   Reread  Still as good as I remembered  Read it years ago in my mid teens because I was so into Greek Mythology and I just wanted to read the story about Odysseus  Achilles  Hector  Aeneas  You need a good translation and want to read epic poetry if you want to enjoy it  I found little things I didn t know or remembered  Reading it along side a non fiction on the Trojan war and Marion Zimmer Bradley s Firebrand just made the text look and sound even better   Brad Pitt gets mad and kills lots of Trojans More or less  The Iliad  by Homer is an amazing feat of the letters  and more if we take into account that it was written almost 3000 years ago  And if you want no other reason  take this one  that a huge book  around 1000 pages in the Spanish version I read  about a few warriors fighting and killing each other  feels breezy and is fun  and only drags a little bit in parts  That you can read  or listen to  to 24 quite long parts of people menacing each other  showing off  and Homer constantly repeating that they are all amazing fighters  loved by the gods  etc etc  and not get tired  is a feat by itself The book has the most basic  and widely known  stories  Handsome Paris has  stolen  Helen from Menelaus  her first husband  enraging the Greeks  who to go to Troy with revenge in their minds  The gods  in general  believe Troy should be destroyed  even if some of them are in favor of the Trojans  Apollo  for example  So after a weird introduction  Achilles getting into an argument with Agamemnon because of a girl and deciding to sit the fight out  and his mother going to Zeus and demanding that the Greeks should be pushed close to defeat till they ask for Achilles s forgiveness  to which Zeus agrees   the fight starts  And we have fights  And fights  And fights  And more fights  With lots of similes  amazingly ludicrous examples and comparisons and as much tomfoolery as possible  Wait till characters stop in the middle of a fight to speak to each other for five or six pages  telling each other about random stuff  It all becomes a little bit repetitive at the umpteenth simile about a fighter being like a lion  or when you read the new comparison between the situation a fighter is in and the one a boar is when it is surrounded by humans and dogs But Homer  or whoever glued the story  has a knack for the fantastic and epic  Because this is fantasy and epic at its best  The action is amazing  the characters human  even if cruel to the last   the gods are cool  and even if it has some cheap decisions  making a god appear to take from the battle a character who is close to die   that is part of the charm  and the idea of the story  that gods became human like and human became like gods It s a blast  even if we don t have Brad Pitt in it  Achilles is better  And Ajax  Diomedes  Odysseus  Nestor   9 10 No one said that the Iliad would be an easy read  and it s not  The language used is  at times  archaic and the structure of the story itself is not something that modern readers will be accustomed to  Epic poems are an extreme rarity in modern times  However  none of that could detract me from an interesting and exciting story  It s a war story  it s a personal story  it s a story of defiance and greed  There is a lot going on in The Iliad and I wonder why we never read it in school  We read The Odyssey  a sequel to this story  but we never got around to The Iliad  I have never seen it performed on stage  but I have heard many good things about those adaptations  The story is an epic and it is thrilling  Homer pioneered many stylistic choices and structural flares that lived long beyond his years  In the end  though  The Iliad is simply a great story and one that is worth your time and attention  I read The Iliad in high school and to be honest I was confused throughout the whole book  It was not until we discussed it in class that I began to understand what was happening  I decided to give it another read and I loved it  The way it is written can be a bit confusing but with guidance it becomes a lot easier  This is probably not a book I would reread for fun The book tells the story of the Trojan War fought between the Trojans and the Greeks  Achaeans   The main characters of this book are Achilles  Hector  Paris  Helen  Agamemnon  Briseis and the Gods This is definitely a book I would have my class read and them have a class discussion to make sure everyone knows what is going on because I know this book can be a bit confusing  This book is intended for high school students  There are many activities that can be done after the novel which would further help students understand the novel  I really love Homer and Greek Mythology  That being said The Iliad is not my favorite work involving either  I just don t consider it as entertaining or as useful for trying to decipher the riddle of Indo European religious beliefs and practices as other sources  Its still something you should read if you have an interest in the subject matter and is still a pretty good yarn as far as entertainment value  If you want to read a book that is all about war  and really nothing else but war  then The Iliad is the book for you  Now when people say it s an epic poem  they really mean epic  This entire novel is about guys who are fighting guys that all die because mister steal your girl came in and took another dude s chick  On a positive note  I will say that there is enough detailed gore to keep you reading  The continuous battles and wars that happen are actually all different that are very intriguing to read  The ongoing plot of war really never gets old  One minute you ll say to yourself   Oh golly  another battle   but once you re done reading it  you ll say to yourself   Whoa  that was cool  The characters are Greek gods and goddesses which makes it quite interesting to see them either fight with each other or fight against each other  For future reference to people that haven t read this book  I would recommend you get to know your Greek gods and goddesses  because it will come in handy when they randomly show up in a battle The setting is based in the city of Troy  an ancient city in Turkey  Battles are fought all around the city  as well as it s environs  In my opinion this is a great setting for this book because their are a lot of rural areas Homer s word choice and his ways that he writes can be very hard to read and understand sometimes  Every now and then I would have to reread certain sections just so I could see in my head what was going on  Once I did understand what was happening  I thought the section was very interesting Overall I definitely recommend this book  If you re into that intense war and nothing else  this book is perfect  Other than some of the confusing mumbo jumbo that Homer writes  this book is very fun to read and keeps you hooked to read more  NOTE  This review pertains specifically to the audiobook performance  I m not qualified to judge the relative quality or merits of a particular translation from ancient Greek  so I can t say whether as a translation Fitzgerald s version is better or worse than any other scholar s I ve been a fan of ancient mythology since I was very young  and I ve read many different versions of The Iliad in verse and prose throughout my life as well as seen several different movies based on the epic poem and its companion  The Odyssey  This is the first time I ve simply listened to it  and I was highly impressed Narrator Dan Stevens does a fantastic job of replicating the tones  rhythms  and modulations of many different voices and sound effects throughout the entire 11 disc reading  Often  his capable narration of the voluminous boastfests and countless bloody battles  dizzying in the variety of graphic violence and grisly deaths presented  transported me in ways the movies never have  As Stevens read  I could hear the clanging of armor and thudding of bodies as warriors fell  and I had no trouble visualizing eyes bursting from sockets  teeth flying from shattered jaws  brains oozing from split skulls  and intestines flowing like water from slit bellies during the extended combat scenes  Of course  The Iliad isn t just about mortals boasting and fighting  we re treated to repeated glimpses of gods and goddesses arguing amongst themselves and mortals giving impassioned speeches about honor  duty  and vengeance  Here again Dan Stevens excels at varying his tone  volume  and pace for the different characters  I never had trouble understanding which character was speaking at any given time  I don t know if this production was nominated for a 2014 Audie Award  but it should have at least been longlisted  Dan Stevens was a finalist for solo male narration in 2015 for The Odyssey  and if he wasn t nominated for The Iliad  it s a shame One warning  If copious descriptions of graphic violence and sword and spear melee disturb you  this audiobook isn t for you  But if that doesn t bother you  this is an outstanding way to experience The Iliad the way it was intended for its original audiences in 5th century BCE Greece to experience it   This book is so crucial to Greek  archaic  literature  and almost seems a joke to have to claimed to have been read by just so many people without seeing it s importance  Aside from the daunting idea that this story was originally passed by word  and to attribute so many names to honor in the culture  this story does hold other powerful traits in subject matter of the story Firstly  I need to have a shout out to The Illiad for having contained one of the first instances of romantic dialogue between characters shared  This book is an amazing example of personification of the human psyche by utilization of the Gods of the culture  And lest not us forget my favorite Greek term ate  by which Athena forced Agamemnon s poor choices leading to  temporary insanity  Though if you re reading it  please have no shame skipping a few sections in which they list the various vessels into the war zone to attribute to family names  etc  It s interesting to me that I never have read the Iliad or the Odyssey until now  The beginning is extremely boring  but the payoff is good  Part of the problem is that the intended audience  in BCE Greece  would have known a lot about the Trojan war already  I found that much of what I did know about the Trojan war wasn t even included in the Iliad  It s just a small excerpt from the greater legend  The beginning also is a little lacking because we  as modern civilized folk  don t tend to have the same culture as those ancients  I also read listened to a Great Courses lecture series on the Iliad that helped confirm a lot of what I felt when reading the epic The payoff is good  The story is fairly episodic  and over time you grow accustomed to the pacing of straightforward motive that eventually leads to unbelievably gory bloodshed  Really  some of the graphic descriptions here are more brutal than anything I ve come across in modern literature  You don t quite see it in movies with sword fighting  but Homer  or whoever  really had quite a way with describing steel pushing through body parts  let not my bones be laid apart from yours  Achilles  but with themthe translation in my copy was denying me the gay  embrace it like Homer did   also the lines were not as beautifully translated as I remember reading them in others  When it comes to translated literature  you have to be careful which copy you get a hold of  it really changes a lot   Five excellent Homeric similes using  As    even so  construction 1  As a mountain falcon  swiftest of all birds  swoops down upon some cowering dove   the dove flies before him but the falcon with a shrill scream follows close after  resolved to have her   even so did Achilles make straight for Hector with all his might  while Hector fled under the Trojan wall as fast as his limbs could take him   Book 22 2  As a fire raging in some mountain glen after long drought   and the dense forest is in a blaze  while the wind carries great tongues of fire in every direction   even so furiously did Achilles rage  wielding his spear as though he were a superhuman force  and giving chase to those whom he would slay  till the dark earth ran with blood   Book 20 3  As two swart oxen both strain their utmost at the plow which they are drawing in a fallow field  and the sweat steams upwards from about the roots of their horns   nothing but the yoke divides them as they break up the ground till they reach the end of the field   even so did the two Ajaxes stand shoulder to shoulder by one another   Book 13 4  As when the mighty sea that thunders on the beach when the west wind has lashed it into fury  it has reared its head afar and now comes crashing down on the shore  it bows its arching crest high over the jagged rocks and spews its salt foam in all directions  even so did the serried phalanxes of the Danaans march steadfastly to battle   Book 4 5  As when a man gives a great ox hide all drenched in fat to his men  and bids them stretch it  whereon they stand round it in a ring and tug till the moisture leaves it  and the fat soaks in for the many that pull at it  and it is well stretched   even so did the two sides tug the dead body hither and thither within the compass of but a little space   the Trojans steadfastly set on dragging it into Ilion  while the Achaeans were no less so on taking it to their ships  and fierce was the fight between them   Book 17  i absolutely loved the story  revenge love crazy goddesses what more could you want  but i don t think anyone would be able to read chapter two without falling asleep as it is literally a catalogue of the Greek ships  The Iliad and the Odyssey are the earliest literary works in the European tradition and represent the culmination of a centuries long tradition of orally transmitted poetry The Iliad focuses on events that happened during the last year of the ten year Trojan war which began because of the abduction of Helen from her husband Menelaus to be given as a prize of the most beautiful woman in the world  to Paris of Troy Time  honorKleos  glory or fameXenos  guest  host  friend  stranger or foreignerXenia  the guest host relationshipIt s all because of the women     Paris was gifted with the abducted Helen  wife of Menelaus The Greeks go to war at Troy to get her back Agamemnon gives back the priest s daughter  Chryseis  when requested Then he takes Achilles prize  Briseis Now Achilles won t fight as he has been disrespected And off we go Agamemnon  Apollo is persecuting them because I refused the splendid ransom for the girl Chryseis  And why  Because I wanted to have her at home myself  Indeed  I like her better than my wife Clytamnestra  Chryseis is quite as beautiful and no less clever or skilful with her hands Agamemnon  But here is a threat  in the same way as Phoebus Apollo is robbing me of Chryseis  whom I propose to send off in my ship with my crew  I will come in person to your hut and take away fair cheeked Briseis  your prize  Achilles  to let you know how far I am your superior and to teach others to shrink from claiming parity with me and playing equal to my face The sacred offering of oxen to do honour to the god was quickly set in place round the well built altar  The men rinsed their hands and took up the sacrificial grains       When they had made their prayers and thrown the grain over the victims  they first drew back the animals  heads  slit their throats and skinned them  Then  for the god s portion  they cut out the thigh bones  wrapped them in folds of fat and laid raw meat from the rest of the animal above them  These pieces the old priest burned on wood spits while he poured libations of red wine over them and the young men gathered round him with five pronged forks in their hands  When the God s portion had been consumed by fire  they are the offal and then carved the rest of the victims into small pieces  pierced them with skewers  roasted them carefully and drew them all off When their work was done and the meal prepared  they feasted  and no one went without a share  Their hunger and thirst satisfied  the young men filled the mixing bowls to the brim with wine and went round the whole company  pouring some into each cup for a libation to the god  And for the rest of the day the young Greek warriors sang and danced to appease the god with a beautiful hymn celebrating the archer Apollo  to which he listened with delight Out came the goddess  blood  the ichor that runs in the veins of the blessed gods  who eat no bread and drink no sparkling wine and so are bloodless and called immortals Achilles on losing Patroclus  As it is  you lie mangled here  and my heart rejects all thought of food  Not that I lack it  I lack you Aeneas  You get the kind of answer you have asked for Zeus  For all creatures that breathe and creep about on the earth  there is none so miserable as man God s are immortal  know of death  but do not experience it Animals are mortal  but don t know they are going to die Humans are both mortal and know they must die Dr Elizabeth Vandiver Slow at parts  but well worth it when Achilles finally goes beast mode  Read it with The Odyssey so you can get Homer s contrast of Achilles and Odysseus  One of them wants to find eternal life through glorious death  The other turns down eternal life in order to home to die in peace with his family   A true literature canon  action packed and gruesome throughout  What I find astounding is that this is the oldest piece of surviving work of European literature and although the text has of course been translated  it is clear to see that this is a true masterpiece and should be on everyone s read list   My summary thus far  in two sentences  Agamemnon and Achilles squabble over concubines  Achilles loses  sulks  Achaeans and Trojans begin battle  fueled by Gods  many great sons of great men described  then slaughtered Update  Spiraling cycles of revenge  Many men become heroes  then die gruesomely  After reading and thoroughly enjoying The Odyssey in college  I vowed to read its predecessor and finally came round to it Unfortunately  I did not enjoy The Iliad with the same rapt delight as I did The Odyssey  Perhaps Homer is best read  in parts  with a group who can then share their introspections Reportedly written in the 8th century BC  it is a Greek epic poem written about the battles of the Achaeans and the Trojans during the well known Trojan War  While the writing was surprisingly easy to digest  the multitude of characters was not and the battles  depicted with graphic gore seemed endless Achilles  a brutal and headstrong warrior is merciless and swift in his role in battle  He abhors Agamemnon for taking one of the women he has kidnapped and claimed for his own which creates a festering rift between the two King Agamemnon is self centered and quick to judgment  often to the detriment of his soldiers  He seems unfazed by the carnage around him and seems only to have concern over his own needs Beloved friend to Achilles  Patroclus is extremely devoted to him  yet doesn t share his zealousness for battle  The ties that bind their relationship are known by all which leads to the demise of one Zeus  the king of the Gods seems disinterested in the war and only after his wife Hera s urgings  takes action to intervene  He tries to maintain neutrality and to set the stage for the other gods to do the same  but is convinced by Achilles  mother to support the Trojans A meeting with Homer would surely be delightful  A stroll through modern day Greece would likely prove unnerving so we d steer clear and focus on the mysteries of this famed poet s life  I d love to ask him about his simple  yet lengthy poetic style  Perhaps he could educate a new generation of up and coming bards My rating for The Iliad is a 8 out of 10   Nu om vartannat dar ljod bade jubel och jammer i striden alltsom man stod eller foll  och pa marken flodade bloden Sasom nar  svallande av to och regn  tva floder for

Introduction and Notes by Bernard KnoxThe introduction is very dry  but the poem  itself  is rich with description and content  In fact  it almost too rich  Every blow  every death  every weapon  every piece of armor is described in excruciating detail  Many time  a brief history of the warrior  his horses  or his armor is also provided  Blood and guts dominate the blow by blow descriptions of the conflict  and the battle seems interminable The translation is truly superb  Robert Fagles does a great job of translating the original Greek into modern English  The ending is anticlimactic  I was expecting a more powerful ending to Homer s epic poem  but it is what it is  I suppose  The book is long  and is not an easy read  IMO  Still    it is worth the effort  Must read to everyone who s interested in ancient Greek civilization  p 84 Let us move Hector to challenge all comers to single combat Holy battles  Batman  The war begins around page 40 and lasts the entire novel  What is more surprising is that the text does not cover the entire engagement  The reader is left with the invaders at the gates  presenting only the battle outside of the city  There is a crazy body count throughout the course of the narrative  Men fight and struggle as the tides of the war go back and forth  showing many noteworthy battles The gods are directly involved in almost aspect of the lives of the characters in the story  Outcomes of the fighting is consistently changed by the interjections of the gods  Later in the story  page 236  the gods join the battle full force  The story is a wild ride and a excellent war story  This book took me forever  But it was definitely worth reading  Exciting  great story telling  LOL moments for me include 1  How there was soooo much uproar over Patroclus   dead  2  Various hoodwinking episodes by the gods3  GODS TAKE SIDES  4  Fighting disagreements bullying amongst the godsAlso  props for making this Greek epic so readable  There is no way that he and I can talk about theseirrelevant things or waste time chatting togetherlike a girl or boy in their love talk  a girl and a boyloving each other s sweet names and whispered endearments     Hector on confronting Achilles My child  you have deserted your favorite human     Zeus to Athena  Ares began by attacking Athena  shaking his huge bronze spearas he bellowed insults  Why are you once again inciting the gods to combat  you nasty bitch     Ares to Athena When Hera saw it  immediately she called to Athena and said  Can you believe it  Look at that  daughter of Zeus There goes the stupid twit through the thick of the battle leading him off the field  Go after her  now  When she heard these words  Athena rushed off  delighted and as she caught up  she punched Aphrodite hardin the breast  she reeled and fell to the ground and tookAres down with her  I listened to the audiobook version of this with translation by Robert Fitzgerald  I enjoyed listening to The Iliad very much  I knew very little about the Trojan War but had seen the movie  Troy   which tells the story with some alterations and without mentioning how the gods interacted with humans   a key element of the story   Dan Stevens  of  Downton Abbey   was an excellent narrator  five stars for his reading   and I don t think I would have gotten as much from the book if I had only read it  Chapter two was particularly uninteresting to me as it was a listing of all the ships and the linage of their Captains who traveled with Agamemnon to Troy  The story itself gave me a better understanding of the Ancient Greeks and their way of life  I will probably listen to this again in the future   A 12 lesson  6 hour  discussion of The Iliad  Elizabeth Vandiver is a jewel of a teacher  I would love to sit in her class  So  next best thing  Teaching company CDs  Thoroughly enjoyed  Now on to the Odyssey  I read the version originally translated by E V  Rieu  later revised and updated by Peter Jones and D C H  Rieu The Illiad wasn t the easiest of reads  The language takes a bit of time to get your head around and a number of characters have the same names I wanted to read it as one of those  I really should read that some day  kind of things and I m glad I did  One of the oldest pieces of fiction in existance  you can see why it stood the passage of time The time period was the biggest suprise for me  I expected the story to run the full ten year war but it actually covers the last month or so I d recommend this to any fantasy fan  Here is the original and worth taking the time   Before I began the book  I thought it would be a dry war story like so many other ancient stories  Soon after starting it though I was pleasantly surprised at the story and how much I enjoyed it and actually felt for the characters  It presents the Trojan war in not a particularly special light  but it shows through its descriptions of the battles and the characters the values that the Greeks and Trojans held most important  like honor and justness  Sometimes the humans themselves seemed even more just than the gods that were portrayed in an almost humorous light  The way the narrator presents the verses as well made it seem very epic indeed  There were very few dry spots  and although there is not much in the way of a relevant theme to my life to take away  the story itself was enjoyable and gave me energy just to read it  Amazing epic Poem  Even if it was for school  I LOVED it   25The Iliad is an epic poem about the Trojan War The Iliad was the first difficult book I read  I even attempted it before I read the Lord of the Rings  I would still to this day consider it to be the most difficult book I have ever read  This is due to how young I was  as well as to the difficult language and length  After a few pages I wanted to throw the book across room  and so I decided to pace myself and only read it while I was at church  therefore making it impossible for me to toss it  I have always been in love with Greek mythology  and so reading about some of my favorite heroes in action was an absolute treat for me  It was also a good precursor for the Odyssey  My favorite part was the Catalog of Ships  or maybe the part where everyone gets a spear through the chin to the back of the neck and then rolls down a hill like a great log  In the book of Iliad there is a ten year war because of a love triangle  pride  a packed made between kings  All over in the book a daughter of a Priest Chryses is stolen and the kidnapper  King Agamemnon refuses to return her  Nine years later of plague on the city  the city demands King Agamemnon gives her back  King Agamemnon will only agree if the trade for her sister  Briseis  Briseis is Achilles  girlfriend once he gives her up  Achilles  the best warrior of Achaeans  stops fighting in hope that others will notice the losses that they need him  Patroklos  Achilles best friend  ask to take his place in war  Approving of Patroklos taking his place in war  gives him his armor  Patroklos in Achilles  armor misguides and terrifies the Trojans  Patroklos dies by the hand of Hector  which enrages Achilles  Achilles wants revenge so he asks for a one on one with Hector  Read to find out who win
