There’s presumably a rule where only smart people are awarded Nobel Prizes in Physics. Richard Feynman was no exception. This memoir is filled with anecdotes from his childhood spent fixing radios, his experiences as a young man doing bomb research at Los Alamos up through his days as a renowned professor at Cal Tech. The central theme was always that this is one smart cookie. It was interesting to pick up on his thought processes. It probably didn’t feature as much pure science as most of his other books, but at least you could appreciate his intuition into the physical world’s biggest puzzles. Rather than emphasizing the technical details of physics, most of his stories were focused on his other interests and his geeky humor.

While some of the stories were entertaining, and the lumens of candle power abounded, it didn’t always work for me. I kept getting the feeling that had the same stories been told in the third person, they would have been better – less egotistical sounding. In every one of his sidelines, he was masterful. It was like he was still driving home the point of how brilliant he was even when he was slumming it. After a while, I got tired of hearing how he became fluent in Portuguese when he taught in Brazil, or impressed the locals to no end with his distinctive style of bongo playing, or could dance like a professional, or got just about any woman he wanted to sleep with him. It was this last one that left the worst taste in my mouth. Some of his tales of attraction and conquest occurred when one of his wives was on her death bed. 

He was probably not as bad as I’ve made him sound. Like I said, we can certainly appreciate his intellect. He had a rare ability to explain difficult concepts in laymen’s terms, too. I got a confirmation of this a week after I finished the book when we were interviewing a former student of his from Cal Tech. He mentioned the “Feynman Effect”: a phenomenon whereby someone asking him a question got answered in such a clear and intuitive way that it was only later that they realized they still didn’t know exactly how it all tied to their existing understanding.

So, count me as a fan of his scientific contributions and his ability to communicate, but not of his swagger. If it had all been a bit of a joke (you know, physicist … funny hair … limited social skills … but a would-be Lothario in spite of it), I would have laughed along with him, but I don’t think that was his intention. 

A truly fascinating journey into the extraordinary (but also sometimes annoying) mind of Richard Feynman. His curious and mischievous nature not only (spoiler alert) won him the Nobel prize of physics, but also made him able to e.g. control his own sleep, pick up any girl at the bar and become a semi-famous painter and musician. 
In addition to telling a lot of amusing stories, Feynman also constantly questions why things are as they are, and if he believes they are not how they should be, he makes sure to say so. For example, both from his studies, and later, from being a teacher, Feynman experienced that there were something wrong with the educational system. The way it was built didn't really give the student's any true knowledge, but merely taught them how to perform well on the tests. He says (which is one of my favorite quotes from the book): "People's knowledge is so fragile they don't even know what they know". Unfortunately, I think this applies even more so today. Or what do I know?

Richard Feynman was an American, theoretical physicist who won a Nobel Prize in 1965. This book is a collection of somewhat outrageous experiences he had during his lifetime. If you like Physics and you like interesting views on everyday life, you'll like this book. I marked the following on page 269: 

(one of his hobbies was drawing and he preferred women)

"One model I met had been a Playboy playmate. She was tall and gorgeous. However, she thought she was too tall. When she would come into a room, she'd be half stooped over. I tried to teach her, when she was posing, to please stand up, because she was so elegant and striking. I finally talked her into that.

Then she had another worry: she's got "dents" near her groin. I have to get out a book of anatomy to show her that it's the attachment of the muscles to the ilium and to explain to her that you can't see these dents on everybody; to see them, everything must be just right, in perfect proportion, like she was. I learned from her that every woman is worried about her looks, no matter how beautiful she is."

I haven't posted anything on Goodreads since I don't know when so I'm going to try to get caught up over the next few weeks. Stand by! 


This memoir was my introduction to Richard Feynman. And the more I find out about him the more amazed I am that this was my first exposure to this strange, brilliantly simple man. He writes this memoir to explain himself. He didn’t like or trust the government – yet he worked for the government while building the bomb. He loved women. I mean he really loved them. Married a few – but was involved with many more than a few. He cracked some safes – but it mostly involved trickery and fakery – two things that he excelled in. He was insanely curious. He was kept out of the service because they ruled him mentally ill. He wanted to hallucinate – but didn’t want to do drugs (with the exception of marijuana). He liked to drum but really faked his way through that. He did not consider himself a musician. He was an excellent subject for hypnotists. He was a physicist and he helped to build THE BOMB. He wasn’t content to be curious – but wanted others to be curious too. He wanted to explain complex things simply so all would understand. Sometimes I thought I would have liked the man – sometimes I was glad I was just reading about him.
