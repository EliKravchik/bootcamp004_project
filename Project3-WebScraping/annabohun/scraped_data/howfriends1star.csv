"22",21,"André","What carnegie is saying is that your communication does have an effect on the other side. You cannot not communicate. If you want to sincerely be an asshole to other people, be it. But be ready for an likewise reaction. Carnegie emphasizes our creative part in any relationship. As you sow, so you shall reap. Period. You always manipulate other people, but be aware of the ambiguity of the word ""manipulation"" !Manipulation itself is neither good nor bad, it just means that you are influencing, that you are creating.People who accept their responsibility (their power of their response[-bility]) Can use communication as an uplifting process to create beautiful and appreciative relationships. In my humble opinion that is what I interpret in the message of Carnegie: You alway influence others, but how will you ? with construcitve or destructive words, acts and thoughts ?In communication not only what is said , but hwo it is received is important.Acting involves the part of pretending. But that very point makes the difference. If you pretend to be appreciative and interested in the other person, people will recognize, because your actions are incongruent. The difference between sincere and insincere appreciation etc. is that you are convinced that you do create relationships. Yes, sometimes you feel lets say angry because of the other person, and acting all nice whilst being angry is such an incongruent behaviour. But Carnegie never said anything like ""pretend to be appreciative while not"" he said : Be sincerely appreciative, that means in thought, word, feeling and deed.But the book is not free of criticism. I do not like that caregie calls his book a manual to win friends, but by nature it is rather a guide to be a good salesperson. That is one point of big misunderstanding Carnegie is evoking. Because in his examples people almost always want to make money or profit. But that's not what friendships and family are about. Yet his overstressing of sale could lead the reader to that false premise.Also Carnegie is missing to emphasize certain most important points, that a crucial to any functioning relationship, like telling all that is important to know, or that I di have a choice with whom I spend my time. The examples he's giving are shaped by people you wouldn't necessarily chose as friends, but are related in terms of work to you in some way. I think of it as good to be able to handle those people he's showing as an example, but I'd never chose as freinds.Would you chose someone as a friend who talks of himself, but shows no real interest in you ? I wouldn't. But I also wouldn't mind to sell someone like that something.2 Stars because Carnegie meshed up business relations with friendships.That book is meant to handle people, not to gain and enjoy friends."
"28",27,"Evelyn Marinoff","Dale Carnegie offers helpful guidelines on how to connect with others. Seemingly intuitive, the steps he offers are powerful tools for everyone who wants to succeed in their personal and professional life."

"87",86,"Navin","This is a sad book. A book that aims to turn us into manipulating individuals who would want to achieve their means through flattery and other verbal-mental tricks. Even technically, it seems to me that the ploys' in this book would never really work. Here is a quote from the book - “Don't be afraid of enemies who attack you. Be afraid of the friends who flatter you.” And what does the book do? It tries, or at least pretends to turn you into a someone who would flatter everything that moves – so that you get - WHAT YOU WANT. Most of us read so that we are inspired, moved, even shocked or atleast entertained by stories. We also read so that we understand better and stretch the possibilities of our minds and hearts, to be better human beings. We definitely do not read to become conniving ugly creatures to be held prisoners by our greed. And come on get a grip – this is essentially a sales book. "
"88",87,"Jordan","Read Quiet instead. Even if you're an extrovert. "
"92",91,"Joy Prior","mmm... I recognize the literary significance of this book as a novel publication for self help books that I believe changed literature. on that note I found much of the information biased and it struck me as a book written by a man for men similar to how I believe Twilight was written by a women for women. The audiance was very specific and part of me wanted to stand up and scream, ""if you do not know this basic information about people you need more than a self-help book to help you learn this."" some of the information was good but I was slightly disturbed by how the author emphasized the selfishness of kindness"
"115",114,"Bethany Beachum","When it comes to offering keen psychological insights into interpersonal relations, Dale Carnegie's got it down. His underlying motivations, however, are entirely wrong, in my opinion. This book is aimed at salespeople, and thus seeks to influence people as a way of manipulation or gain. It also ends with a particularly enlightening passage on advice to husbands and wives which highlights the deeply sexist culture of the 1930's in the United States."

"166",165,"Robert Oswald","I did not mean to add this book and can not figure out how to remove it from ""the shelf"". Fuck."
"175",174,"Micaela","It's ridiculous. Most of it is just common sense on how to be a decent human being all while shadowed with tricks for blatant, shameless manipulation. It is outdated and just plain stupid in my opinion. Run around being a fake and a fraud and you are basically following the rules this book sets. The sexism was not appreciated either. I read a few parts back when I was 11, it was a gift from my mother (haha) since I wasn't too sure of how to make friends, however I quickly noticed it was meant for 'older' people; it simply felt useless to me aside from the common sense stuff. 7 years later, I picked it up again out of curiosity and it turned out to be just plain laughable. Badly written, bad advice, overall questionable ideas. Nah."
"215",214,"Robyn Peterson","I found this book full of common sense advice that I do every day already. I'm glad people are finding this book useful still after all this time, I just wish I had learned something from it."
"242",241,"Rúben","This is a dangerous book in my opinion and the proposed 'techniques' can be mischievously used by people without principles. It is inconsistent since it claims that the proposed 'techniques' promote friendship, which might be true (if well used), but then offers several examples of how you can use them to trick others to your benefit. There are many other good, modern self-help books that have upgraded Dale Carnegie's work."
"254",253,"Andy Norris","Spoiler alert: As a sentient being you should probably already know everything in this book. The existence of this book makes me both sad and angry. Sad that it has to exist, and angry that people will say this ""changed their lives."" That there are that many people who need lessons in empathy is startling. And many of those folks are using -- probably faked -- empathy as a tool to sell shit."
"265",264,"Lauren Cook","This book is just so outdated! The advice was comical."
"267",266,"Doug","Forced to take a Dale Carnegie class. This book was presented as true stories but was obviously apocryphal stories made up to illustrate whatever point he was trying to make. The other managers where I worked all had to take the class and there was a lot of lip service paid to what a great class it was, but I noticed that nobody changed the way they dealt with people."
"271",270,"Steve Whiting","One of the all-time classics of self-improvement texts. It's pretty dated now, and some of the examples now seem quaint and unlikely to succeed, but there is still some good advice in there on how to get along with people. On the other hand, I felt some of the techniques strayed well into the territory of manipulation or gamesmanship, and despite his earllier protestations of avoiding flattery seemed to be remarkably similar to applying ample amounts of insincere flannel. It's also extraordinarily long-winded, and stuffed to the gunwhales with anecdotes about people with improbable names."

"325",324,"Velika","This book needs some major updating. I wanna know how to handle a bitchy co-worker who doesn't admit their wrong....not how Abe Lincoln drafted a letter about how angry he was he didn't win the war.

"465",464,"Michael Stein","This book is completely overrated. It is not about making true friends. It is about how to be obsequious and smarm people. Sucking up to somebody because of what they may do for you is not making a friend."
"467",466,"Yaaresse","Or ""How to be a Complete Slimeball and Annoy People Who Will Learn to Avoid You Like the Plague."" I think I was in junior high when this thing appeared in a bag of used books given to us by someone who was moving. I read it out of boredom and realized it contained every oily, insincere, disingenuous tactic I'd observed people use when they wanted to pull one over on someone else. This is the guy we blame for Ziglar, Hopkins, Sandler--all the ""manipulate people for fun and profit"" guys. To this day, I detest these kinds of tactics and anyone who tries them on me is pretty much looking to be shown the door in an ungentle manner. "

"689",688,"Carolyn","I was initially going to rate this book 2 stars, or in my rating system ""few redeeming qualities."" While there are a few tips on positive phrasing, what I learned from this book was that white dudes with money and authority can influence people if they're nice to them. Women, people of colour, poor people, etc are already socialized to appear ""nice"" and subordinate and to compromise, and people still don't take them seriously. The mythology throughout the book of the poor man bootstrapping his way up the ladder is just that: mythology. These tips don't help break down the systematic disrespect that comes with racism, sexism or classism.Then the last section on marriage is a product of its time: ragingly sexist advice for middle-class 1950s housewives. The last section negatively countered any usefulness in the first section. I ended by rating it 1 star, or in my rating system ""wasted my time."""
"691",690,"Antanas","You can't teach yourself how to behave to influence others because that kind of skills can come only through life experience. It's a short sighed thing to believe that only the consciousness is what in play when you talk to people. You can play tricks, drop marbles in the meetings and do other tips but they wont get you anywhere. It's like going to those first dates with a girls where you had trouble to think what to say of because you were thinking.Simply put, this book encourages doing versus being."
"699",698,"Leanne Hoffmann","Read it as a teenager. Hated it. Still dislike the concepts. "
"703",702,"Alicia Pan","Side with most critics. The book, if applied extensively, at most turns you into a people-pleaser that serves you well in short term by manipulating people and in most cases being not you unless indeed having the sweetest nature that's sadly run by an unconscious mind. Carnegie's shallow knowledge on the meaning of life that is filled with lasting love, inner peace, joy and self-fulfillment sought within one rather the pathetic way the title suggests is beyond shocking. Whoever feels the need to seek external approval or identification as a vehicle of their happiness, when they do, sadly obtains one that is short-lived and at unease. "
"711",710,"Margo Pajula","definitely the most stupid book I ever held in my hand(other than some old communist propaganda), but it could be a nice guide into a lot of peoples minds that are actually thinking that they should trick you into loving them.

"718",717,"Helen Bower","This book is a classic for a reason. The principles are golden! But it is very outdated. There are probably two women in the entire book. I wish that someone would revise this with updated examples."

(also, dear mr carnegie, seriously, mrs lincoln??? what the hell do you have against her ahaha.)if you must read this book, pick up the new edition; I will bet money it is less sexist and therefore at least slightly less annoying :)"
"761",760,"Arash","Didn't like it. Very cliche!"
"775",774,"Paul Rhodes","Utter dreck! Anyone who thinks this book offers important wise advice on friendship is an idiot.Dale Carnegie was nothing but a huckstering sophist, and a very repulsive one at that. For those of you who may not know, Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People is a handbook on how to exploit friendship for the sake of financial and political gain. Now fans of this book (why such people are allowed to read, much less vote, I do not know) will say this book helped them overcome their shyness and make real friendships. But Dale Carnegie is not interested in real friendship. His only concern is to exploit friendship for financial and political gain. One need not be Einstein to know this. One need only read all the garish claims on the back of the book (I have an earlier edition than the one usually found in bookstores today) such as, say, ""Increase your earning power"" ""(Carnegie's book will) [m]ake you a better salesman, a better executive."" If the book were really about true friendship, as its many lobotomized fans insist, then one would expect the blurbs to claim that the book will make the reader a better friend, not a better salesman. A true friend cares about his friends, but a salesman cares about his profit, and if friendship come between him and his profit, then so much for friendship. Dale Carnegie's groupies are utterly oblivious to his promotion of such shameless exploitation, which is as obvious as a communal bedpan. And they are also utterly oblivious to historical facts. Had they some historical knowledge, then these sycophants-in-training surely would have read Dale Carnegie's pilpul with slightly less pollyannish gullibility. For instance, if they knew anything about the Age of the Robber Barons, they might have found Dale Carnegie's depiction of Andrew Carnegie as a man truly concerned for the lot of his fellow man a bit hard to stomach. Sure, Andrew Carnegie smiled a lot and presented a friendly appearance to the press and public, and that was enough for Dale. Dale--like all other sophists, politicians, and prostitutes--cared only for appearances, but underneath the accommodating demeanor of Andrew Carnegie was a heart as hard as the steel his factories forged. Andrew Carnegie would publicly declare his support for rights of the worker and yet let his Manager Frick hire Pinkerton Guards to massacre the union workers. Andrew Carnegie would snatch good PR with his various philanthropies but also poured much of his money into the American Eugenics Movement which managed to get laws passed all over this country that mandated the sterilization of cripples like me. American Eugenics also had a profound influence upon German Eugenics, an influence which one can see documented in the minutes of The Nuremberg Trials. I hope even Carnegie groupies are not that ignorant not to know that influence, however nice, pleasant, and smiling it may be, is bad when it leads to genocide. Yet, I suspect those who swear by this book will continue to have nothing but admiration for Dale Carnegie, whose sycophantic adulation for the ruthless rich who killed off unionized workers and funded the genocide of the weak should offend, repel, and disgust anyone with even a modicum of human thought and decency. Carnegie fans are idiots."
"791",790,"Teri","I felt it had some good principles in relationships with others, but in sharing experiences it felt very fake and phony. Teaching you how to manipulate. No thanks. I vote for honesty. I was glad to finish it. Didn't enjoy it."
"803",802,"Anca Avram","Even though it's a cute read,the examples in this book are really warned out,outdated etc.Some concepts ,like two or so still stand where human beings interaction is concerned,but the rest it's just filled with examples and more examples of people dead long ago or the author gives his life experiences as examples,wich might have worked fine as far as he's concearned but for others,i really don't think so.if i was to write a book with this title,nowdays,it would be more like a tiny brochure and my advices would be,buy some apple hardware,watch game of thrones,watch the news ,get twitter,facebook,pinterest,etc etc,and when you meet someone new ask if he or she likes any of this things and if you can have a fairly long conversation with this person and you click on likes and lifestyles and so many more things wich you'll get instinctivily ,you got yourself a new friend."
"813",812,"Wesley Fox","A 270 page book that could've been just a 20 page pamphlet. In fact you could just read the chapter and section names and get the jist of his advice.Dale Carnegie may have been the first self-help guru in history. His writing style is unorganized rambling similar to a Tony Robbins seminar. It is loads of feel-good phrasing and stories, all oversimplified and self-glorifying. He tries to make himself sound like a normal guy doing amazing things in the typical self-help style. A lot of I's and Me's in this book. His clearly fake humility in telling his stories about his technique are insulting.There is about 15-20 pages of good advice in this book. The fact that Mr. Carnegie insists on you reading all that junk drops this down to one star for me. Also, a portion of the 15-20 pages is common sense that no one should have to read a book to know or realize.If you find this book truly informative and inspirational, it says more about you than Mr. Carnegie's book.

"918",917,"Kelly Swiryn","Saying I wish I had never read this book is an understatement. (I read it methodically in high school, and again a decade later just to be sure.)Any friendly and mature person already knows these ""tricks"" intuitively. However, once I saw it written down like a formula it made me sick. I no longer liked everybody. I no longer took pride in being nice, friendly, or popular. I don't even view most other people as totally autonomous beings anymore, since most people react very predictably to the interactions they have with others. And when other people's actions only seem like REactions, you have much less to be thankful for in this world... your life is just a product of your own work."
"936",935,"Karine Shauli","Just not a fan. I read it to see where it was going and coming from but just pushed myself through this book. Not such a fan of how-to's especially regarding being on top. I have a different perspective on things that is all. "
"938",937,"Hyeon","This books doesn't deserve any praise. I was expecting a helpful book that gives insight to our problems and a good analysis.I wouldn't even have minded if it was boring as long as it was helpful for us. 90% is filled with examples from history, and their daily lives. He doesn't even explain..he just blabbers on and on about useless examples.It's as if he is trying to fill the page to make the book seem thick.The only useful info is the key pointslike...Listen to people Don't argue with people Smile WE ALREADY KNOW THIS  He didn't write a book. He wrote endless boring lists of examples. It was one of the most frustrating and unbelievably stupid book I've ever read. "
"940",939,"Tania","I read this book because it's a classic, so I figured I should. And when an acquaintance of mine suggested it, I really felt compelled to read it. The reason the rating I'm giving it is so low isn't because the ideas are bad, per se, but because the writing style is so annoying to my modern reader's ear that I found the book incredibly hard to read.The ideas themselves, as I said, are fine. I don't find that Carnegie's suggestions are manipulative, as some have accused them of being. In fact, he makes it clear at least two or three times that people who try to use his techniques and suggestions to manipulate people will find that they aren't successful. Alot of what Carnegie is suggesting is basic common sense: be empathetic, be a good listener, don't stuck in a position and instead focus on finding common interests, and give constructive criticism. These are all very useful tips. I appreciated the way Carnegie summed up each chapter with a one sentence bullet. I also liked how each part had a listing of the key point of each chapter from that section. It made skimming through the book much easier. Many of the chapters are repetitive - he talks about criticism in at least three chapters, and he's essentially just expanding on the same point. I would've preferred few chapters providing a more in-depth examination of the key topics, rather than reading alot of chapters that were essentially repetitive. His examples were archaic, which didn't help. Overall, the writing style was frutrating to me as a modern reader. In general, other authors, such as Stephen Covey (Seven Habits For Highly Effective People) and Roger Fisher (Getting to Yes, Difficult Conversations) have addressed the points Carnegie is making in a deeper, more interesting manner.

You can save yourself the time by just reading the bullets at the end of each chapter. The rest is just examples mostly from the early 20th century which doesn't really help resonate (at least for me). I feel like this could be turned into a buzzfeed/Time's bullet list and be more relevant (plus gif's are awesome)."

No se debería seguir publicando."
"1006",1005,"Em","I heard about this book on a thread about books that changed people's lives. Since it didn't seem to be the page-turner type, I decided to get it on audiobook. Also, I'm lazy and wanted to get this one over with. Reading the title made me think ""Gee, don't you mean 'How to Manipulate People So You Can Get What You Want'?"" There was a lot of agreement on this being a life-changing book, though, so I decided to pick it up since I could use some better social skills.In the end, the book didn't really tell me anything new. The techniques mentioned, like smiling, remembering a person's name, and caring about what they want, etc. are all common sense guidelines for social conduct. The book was also 90% boring anecdotes of situations like ""A student of mine decided to ask this man about his life and express interest, and then the man decided he liked the student so much because he was kind enough to listen that he gave him his old car!"" Those anecdotes, and the fact that I was listening to the book being read rather than reading myself it also distinctly reminded me of an old radio show, ""Unshackled"", that I used to listen to when I was younger. It's a program that tells stories of people being ""born again in Christ"" and stuff. It also had cheesy interlude music like this audiobook did. ""Let your hearts and minds be unshackled!"" But that is a personal point off and doesn't really say much about the book itself.The thing that ruined any chance of me going even a little bit along with what this guy was saying was when he said something like ""This isn't manipulating people! We're thinking of what -they- want!"" Those things aren't mutually exclusive! I think the fact that you're trying to cover this up is manipulative. Now, the author did emphasize that he wanted people to be sincere when dealing with other people, but when it comes down to it, I think the reader is taught how to use people as a means to an end instead of treating the person as an end in his/herself. That's not to say the author necessarily adheres to this mentality, but it comes off that way and that's something I cannot abide by. I understand that we use the grocery clerk as mostly a means to check out our food and probably don't give them too much consideration in the five minutes we'll be in their presence, but we aren't trying to make them like us or give us something. All the stories are about what the individual using the technique got out of the experience, but as much what the other person got. Oh, he got listened to, or we were nice to him, or we struck up a good bargain with him. Also, I feel that if we treat people as described in this book, we will be treating them as less than us. There was something said like ""People have psychological needs, like being cared for and by fulfilling those needs for people, you can be on good terms."" I'm not questioning the truth of this statement, but rather the consequences of treating people this way. It's like we'd be treating them as some animals. Oh, dogs like it when you scratch their heads like this, so if you do it and try to be sincere about it, even if you hate dogs, that dog will probably enjoy what you're doing and like you. Yes, humans are technically animals, but you know what I mean...I don't know. I don't want to WIN friends. If I'm going to influence people, I don't want it to be through manipulation or ass-kissing. I'm not the wisest person out there, or even in a good position to be giving social advice given my general reticence, but maybe we don't need to think so much about how to make friends or whatever. Don't be an dick. Think of people as PEOPLE. Be sincere. Be yourself. There, some cliche, common-sense advice. Well, I'm done. I've spent enough time on this book. Here ends another disjointed review."

"1200",1199,"Dave DeCastris","I couldn't put it down and not because it was a thrilling read, because of how creepy the advice was. Maybe Carnegie's words meant more in 1937 when it was originally published. Every page was scarier than the one before. An American mindset I wish carried into today's society and people I've never known or met. Out of time and out of step with my American experience."

"1282",1281,"Gcarvelli","Banale. Dice cose scontate e elenca una serie interminabile di aneddoti che dopo un po' nauseano."
"1301",1300,"Hanoof","كتاب مقيت عن العلاقات المقيتة"
"1306",1305,"Rebecca Miller","""How to Trick People into Liking You"" is vapid and manipulative. And very poorly written. "
"1321",1320,"Ametista","Libro letto per lavoro, (solo con questa scusa posso leggere mentre sono al negozio).Il genere di libri che odio, in cui si cerca di modificare il comportamento personale.Pieno di esempi, noioso ai massimi livelli. Si potrebbe evitare di leggere capitoli per intero e passare al principio da seguire riassunto ad ogni fine."
"1334",1333,"RoseAdagio","There were some good ideas, but I couldn't really get behind the book. Mostly, it was a sales&business-driven pitch of techniques that could also be applied to personal relationships... I felt it made situations and people out to be more simplistic and gullible than they are in real life. The writing was pretty formulaic and uninteresting, even annoying, to read after a while. And the mentality kinda breeds phoniness, in my opinion. So, I personally didn't agree with the approach or get much out of it (it became a chore to get through this book; I only put myself through it b/c my Dad really wanted me to read it, haha X]), but I can see how other people may find it useful. I don't really have much else say about it. X)"
"1339",1338,"Huy","Một trong những cuốn sách mình ghét nhất mọi thời đại và bị nghe lải nhải về nó nhiều nhất mọi thời đại. Ghét ngay từ câu đầu tiên đến câu cuối cùng."
"1342",1341,"Elnura","Deyl Kornegi`dən zəhləm gedən qədər heçkəsdən zəhləm getmir. Kitabı da özü kimidi. Kiminsə bu kitabdan xoşu gələ bilər,amma məncə bu kitabda dost qazanmaq yox, yaltaqlıq öyrədilir"
"1348",1347,"William Osburg","I only read half of the book. I gave it one star because some of the advice he gives is solid, but none of it is his. Don't criticize, actively listen to others, find things in people to be interested in, smile when you talk on the phone, and give honestly positive feedback. These are all great ways to improve social interaction, as well as to become a generally better person. Unfortunately the delivery of everything in this book came across as naive and opportunistic. This does seem to be a book for the upper classes, people in business and sales, or those who simply have little to no social skills. It also feels like either Dale Carnagie wrote this at a time when social interaction was very different, or he in embellishing to the point where none of his anecdotes are believable. I also found his view of other people to be base, generalized, and fundamentally nauseating. "
"1377",1376,"Kris","Wasn't a big fan of this book. I'm sure in its day it was very revealing and informative but in the world of today it reeks of outdated thoughts and examples. e.g.. ""...next time you are at a clam back at your lodge...."" WTF???Thought at the root the points that are made are relevant but not inspiring and can be found in top 10 lists 100 deep on almost any website."
"1395",1394,"Stephen Adams","the only book you need to be a snake oil sales man"
"1412",1411,"M0rningstar","More like ""How to Be a Fraud"". Could be useful for salespeople if their quarries are insecure or not too bright."
"1454",1453,"Michael Amevor","i am hoping this book will be interesting "
"1461",1460,"Tadas Talaikis","I read this 20 or so years ago. OK, I didn't get any lasting impression, but now, after so many years of psychological experiments as a hobby, I hate any book with similar titles because I've lost too much time on this ""self help""B.S. If you want to win ""friends"", you can go to Facebook and if you want real friends, they aren't to be won or influenced. ""How to influence people"" assumes some sort of psychopathy when you sold products by force. It's the new world, 19th century rules don't work anymore. And trust is created by vulnerability, not influence. Carnegie should have talked to some psychiatrist."
"1475",1474,"Jan Argasiński","Do połowy czyta się ciekawie - przede wszystkim ze względu na morze anegdot. Potem niestety... ciągle to samo. Anegdoty, anegdoty, anegdoty + złote myśli. Może i słuszne ale okropnie nudne."
"1479",1478,"Jacob","I don't generally read self-help books. The one or two other ones I've read generally combined bad writing with a door to door salesperson feel and the occasional bit of decent advice.This one manages the bad writing and sales approach but left out the good advice. It doesn't tell you how to 'Win Friends and Influence People' it tells you how to be shallow and manipulative. Alright there may be some good advice in the book, but they're buried beneath a lot dross "

"1490",1489,"دائمة  الأسفار","كفى !أرفع رايتى البيضاء و أعلن إستسلامى أن هذا العالم مُبالغ فيه مُزيّن بكلمات عجيبة بعيدة عن الواقع و أنا أكره هذا !لا أريد أن أكون إنسانة تكسب الاصدقاء و تؤثر فى الناس !فلتزأر العاصفة و لن أدخل هذا العالم مجدداً ! حاولت اللجوء إليه لأهدئ من ثورة أعصابى المتزايدة بشكل مستمر فى الآونة الاخيرة و ها هو يزيدها بورديته السخيفة !"
"1502",1501,"Linden","This felt like a book on people-pleasing and manipulation when I first started reading it in 2008, and I walked away very early on. I'm a very different person now, and I keep hearing good things about how this can help people navigate interpersonal relationships. So, I'm open to giving it another shot and seeing if reading it from a different perspective can provide me with some new insights on working with people."

"1552",1551,"Miro Nguyen","A lot of these ideas ask people to be so soft and un-opinionated. There is a fine line between being a nice person and being someone who does not dare to speak their minds because they are afraid of hurting others. One of the most rewarding experience is to have logical and rewarding arguments so that both parties learn from the experience.This book prevents this experience from happening, creating extremely safe to a point of superficial relationships. "
"1569",1568,"Wessel van der Merwe","still a great read - want a friend - be one..."
"1597",1596,"Victoria","*1.5 stars*Gives lot of ways to ""win"" friends, but was way too cluttered with examples and felt very random and thrown together. All in all I am glad to be done with it."
"1606",1605,"sologdin","Douchey crap, overall. There should, that is, be no need for a text that argues one should actually listen to what others say or that sometimes criticism and complaints get on people's nerves.Other items, such as stating one's interlocutor's name with frequency, is just manifestly obsequious, and constantly smiling is plain oleaginous, a recipe for resting douchebag face."
"1631",1630,"Cathy Carpenter","This is the most boring, tedious, inane book I've ever read. It is a total of 236 pages but the essence could be boiled down to 12 at most. Every chapter, he has one point summarized in a neat box at the end. I skimmed the rest. He gives you six examples when one or two would do. He deliberately repeats himself. He wastes the readers' time.Do yourself a favor and just read the ""In a Nutshell"" summary points at the end of each chapter. You won't miss anything. "
"1643",1642,"Subbarao","test"
"1676",1675,"Silpa Parmar","Hmmmm I gave up on this... I'm not really into this self-help, find yourself, let's analyze everything to death mumbo-jumbo. I gave it a go though!"
"1677",1676,"Michael Korte","Dribble. A series of platitudes 'supported' by a sequence of anecdotes that are often historically wrong. This book is only useful for those entirely lacking in the social graces. 2/10 would not recommend."
