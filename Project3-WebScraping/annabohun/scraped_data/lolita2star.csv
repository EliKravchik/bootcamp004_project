"4",3,"Julie M","This book was boring and a terrible story. The descriptions were great, but that's about all."
"5",4,"Tim Weakley","I have to divide this review in two.Firstly, I have to say that I was biased against this book before I even began because of the subject matter. There is just no way in which you can paint this material as uplifting, or mind broadening, or anything positive that I can think of. Yet it continues to make the various lists of ""great works"". I am not narrow minded...mostly ;) This book however is beyond the bounds of endurance for me. It was difficult to complete.Secondly, I have to look at the bones and blood of the book. Did the author accomplish what he set out to do? Did the work affect me? Yes on both counts. The writing, with the exception of the supposed conflict at the end of the book, I thought was very well done. The combat at the end actually had me laughing because it seemed so silly. Maybe there was supposed to be tension, I'm not sure, but it really hit me as funny.Also...let's not pretend that this is a love story. This entire thing is about control, and mental illness on the part of Humbert and Dolores. He keeps telling himself that he is in love. He doesn't even know what love is. He's fixated on a child that he has turned into a possession. The climactic struggle of the work occurs when some other mental defective manages to steal his toy. His world unravels because he is finally forced to see that it was false and based on this playhouse that he had built around the young girl.I'm not going to go into the perverse mindset required to see a child as a sexual object. The work provokes reactions and strong opinion so in that respect I would say that it is a successful book. Could I have done without reading it? Yes truthfully. Is it a ""great"" work? I think the race of man can aspire to much better things than reading about the thoughts of rapists and pedophiles. It's not great. At most I think history will see it as a curiosity. "
"6",5,"floowee","I have to say one thing... It was hard to finish!! Probably because I read the Indonesian translation. There were to many confusing words and the plot didn't seem coherence one to another. It took me quite a time to finally finish it. Despite all the difficulties, the final chapter was a real enlightenment. It revealed nearly all of my questions for the whole story. And indeed, it is a twisted piece as the rumour said it. I can't give a good rating for it, since I don't like the translated version, but someday, I might read the English version and like it more. "
"7",6,"Maddie Holden","It's hard for me to classify this as a book I've ""read"" when I could hardly even make it over halfway through. I'm sure that any positive reviews about this book are in regards to the lovely writing style, the seemingly heart-wrenching quality of a forbidden love, or the overall popularity of this book. To me, this book is so famous because of one reason: it is terribly controversial. I'm not sure how many people can stomach reading the tale of a middle aged man preying on a pre-teen girl - his step-daughter no less! What some may see as romantic reports of trying to fight the odds to have a happily ever after, I see as the obsession and possession of a young child by an insane and creepy man of a father's age. This book is more criminal than enjoyable. It's horrid, disturbing, and down-right pedophiliac. I would suggest against reading this if you're looking for a truly enjoyable book that won't put your mind at unease."
"12",11,"Reza","Yeah, I thought this book was okay. It hooked me in with the first two paragraphs, and then slowly became a struggle to read. I found him to be long-winded and pretentious. In short, I was bored the majority way through."
"13",12,"Hawra Alq","I honestly thought the book was over rated by my friends who made it sound so good. The author's writing was so confusing at times that i was literally dragging through each chapter hoping for it to get better. "
"15",14,"Pinkyivan","Overall I'd describe it as a good insight into a twisted mind, much like A Scaner Darkly or The Gambler, but even as that it doesn't offer that much. It has more complex language than the two, in fact the writing is what made me interested in it. If it had a more standard writing I probably wouldn't have finished it.It is a good read, but somehow I feel it has not earned the praise it is so often given. In terms of content it is not on the level of other classics and in terms of aesthetics Proust, Poe and heck even Dostoyevsky do a better job (if you got the right translation of course).All in all the best thing about this book is the influance it had on Gene Wolfe so I'm very glad that it exists."

"22",21,"Sufian Abas","Gua tak pernah tertipu dengan Nabokov. Sastera konon. Pui."
"23",22,"Dave Yan","It took me about two weeks to finish reading Lolita. To my disappointment, due to the exclamation of the best work by Nabokov, I felt it difficult to comprehend the flow but read it up anyway. Compared with his Laughter in the Dark, this one is in a totally level of reading difficulty for a English as a second language reader. Guess I have learned quite a lot of vocabulary for sure. "
"24",23,"Morten","Jeg er ikke til ord-gejl, så jeg fandt den noget kedelig! Halvvejs inde, og det må være nok. Gider ikke læse resten. Humbert prøver at skrive/snakke sig fra det forkastelige han gør, og det er da en interessant nok historie, men fortabelsen i ligegyldige detaljer var dråben for mig."
"25",24,"Cherie Medford","It's a classic, so I read it to see what all the fuss was about. Definitely controversial, especially for the time period, but not much else can be said for it, at least not by me. In three hundred twenty some odd pages, nothing happens. The beginning of the book, where he talks about life before meeting Lolita, was more interesting than the middle or end. I also got really tired of translating French words, phrases, and paragraphs. That may reflect more on me than the auhor, but in any case, I'm glad I finally finished it."
"26",25,"nooshisooshi","first 1/3 good. rest repeats. whine me a river. yah yah, this was the first of its kind back in the day."
"27",26,"Virginia Lacefield","Bleah - overrated."
"33",32,"Camila Shimada","Después de mucho pensarlo...creo que lo calificaré con 2 estrellas. A pesar de que el argumento me llamaba mucho la atención, y a ratos quedaba muy pegada, en general no conseguí engancharme con todo y quizás eso se debió a la forma de narrar del protagonista, demasiado difusa y retorcida a ratos (no retorcida de enferma xD sino que daba muchas vueltas, y comentaba mucho y eso me hacía perder el hilo de lo que estaba leyendo)Confieso que lo leí de morbosa nomás; la historia de un Hombre treintón que por un trauma de su niñez se siente atraído por las púberes y termina enamorándose de Lolita, la hija de la loca que le arrienda un cuarto. Es bastante sutil para narrar, porque perfectamente lo podría haber hecho pornográfico y contar detalles pero no lo hizo, y a mi opinión me gustó que siempre se viera el punto de vista del protagonista. Humbert explica todos sus actos, de forma que parece bastante lógica, pero aún así hay cosas que no dejan de ser...tenebrosas en el sentido que se metió igual con una cabra chica de 12 años y que le robó su niñez xD independiente de que ella fuera despierta. Sin embargo, dentro de todo el trastorno del loco, igual deja entrever su cariño y preocupación. En fin, no creo que lo lea de nuevo :/"
"34",33,"Firyal Maulia","Vulgar, detail, detailnya yang bikin menjijikan. yucks"
"39",38,"Matthew","I had imagined Lolita as a twisted love story, but it really is more of a tale of addiction and more specifically obsession. Humbert Humbert's journals are very personal, which makes for shocking and vile literature, but I feel that Nabokov didn't dive into Humbert's pschy deep enough for me. However, I would recommend the book just simply in order to experience Nabokov's brilliant play with words. "
"42",41,"Kendra Powers","slow at parts, but eloquently worded for a book about a pedophile and his nymphet"
"43",42,"Sean Costello","Lolita is a strange mixture of great writing and appalling subject matter. I found the writing style of this book to be enjoyable, and very well done. However, from a content perspective, it is quite a horrific novel. Humbert Humbert (whom I shall refer to as HH) is a pedophile who proceeds to invade the life of a woman so that he can take advantage of her daughter Dolores. When Dolores' mother dies, HH essentially kidnaps her and brings her across the country, doing whatever he pleases to her along the way. Dolores manages to 'escape' from HH with Clare Quilty, a truly monstrous man who lives in a way reminiscent of the film Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom. Ending with HH giving Dolores all the money he has left and killing Clare Quilty.As a character, HH is a tragic individual. An abnormal man who does unspeakable things to children, yet is repulsed by vulgar language? He does comes across as almost likable in some instances, and to be genuinely in love with Dolores towards the end. His character is where I find the story to be intentionally conflicting for the reader, Nabokov introduces HH's pedophilia right from the get go so it is always in the readers mind. No matter what HH does that can be seen as a positive in the story, you can never actually approve of him as a human being because of his disgusting acts. Towards the end of the story, HH seems to be trying to atone for his sins by keeping his perversions under control, providing the monetary means for Dolores and her husband to start their new life, and destroying Clare Quilty (a man far worse than HH). However the fiendish acts he commits through out this story outweigh any and all 'good' he does. Though try as he might, there is no redemption for the things he has done.The narration of this story was really quite interesting and for me the part I enjoyed the most. HH's self-awareness made for a different experience then most novels. He is a clearly sick individual, as you can tell by his bouts of madness evident by his writing throughout the story. Nabokov's use of 'unreliable narrator' also makes the read amusing, not being able to believe everything said with 100% confidence. I did, however, find this novel to be fairly repetitious. Some parts felt like I had read them 4 or 5 times previously and really seemed to be more filler than anything. Overall I thought that Lolita was an alright novel. With, unfortunately, nothing in particular that made it stand out to me as being one of the classics it is revered as, I thought it was just.. odd."
"44",43,"Avery","While extraordinarily well-written, let's be honest- this is probably the creepiest thing ever."
"45",44,"Sally","Ugh."
"47",46,"Tannaz Pirasteh","تنها کاری که بعد از خوندن این کتاب کردم این بود که تأسف خوردم چرا وقتم رو پای خوندنش گذاشتم -_- اصلاً خوشم نیومد تمام کتاب با یک ذهنیت پیش میری که توی مقدمه ی کتاب اومده و در انتها با چیز دیگه ای مواجه میشی که تقریباًَ به استهزا گرفتن خوانندست"
"48",47,"David Davy","Much like Ross and Rachael, Sam and Diane, or even Jerry and Elaine, comedic tension and entertainment value goes downhill after Humbert Humbert achieves his goals. If this is because I am not an astute or patient enough reader, so be it.Or maybe it was the fact that we both have the same name twice that hit a little too close to home."
"50",49,"aosena","مافيها ولا شي مميز ، الكاتب غير قادر حتى على الكتابة عن حالته النفسيّة ، ولا على الوصف الجمالي ولا شي ، كأني أقرأ مجرد أحداث ، كان ممكن تكون نفس دي القصة شي عظيم بس ماش الكاتب ما يعرف يكتب"
"51",50,"Artka Kazaktar","can't stand the writing style"
"55",54,"Carmelita","He's a total sicko!"
"57",56,"Emily Carpenter","I know I was only supposed to write a review for one book for Part One of my Senior Institute Homework. However this book was terrible, awful, and depressing. The writing was poignant and used language in an intruiging way. However although I'm all for free speach by the end of about the 3rd chapter I wanted to destroy the book. The main character almost gets into your mind, and is almost asking you to sympathize with his atrocities. Furthermore because of all the detail from the first character, it made me wonder if the author was writing from personal experience. I definitely do not want to read this book again. "
"58",57,"Butterscotch","Spooky. *Gulp*"
"59",58,"Jes","kinda just one of those books you read so that you know the reference"
"60",59,"Kathy Nealen","Just skimmed the last half of the book because I found it so meaningless and boring. Who would think someone so bad and perverted could be so boring"
"61",60,"Kaethe","As a college freshman I loved this. But the older I get, the more repulsive it becomes to me."
"64",63,"Kelsi","A difficult read, hard to follow what was actually going on. Seeing everything through the eyes of a pedophile was also rather disturbing. It was unsettling knowing that people like this actually exist. Felt especially horrified when Humbert actually drugged 'Lolita' and essentially raped her. Not sure what one could learn from this book... except that pedophilia and kidnapping is wrong... "
"72",71,"Johanna","Disturbing--I couldn't bring myself to continue after reading half way."
"73",72,"Charity","So the book is eloquently written. Some sentences are beautifully lyrical - and for that I give it two stars. HOWEVER, the actually story is really, really icky and I give that zero stars. I knew what the story was about before getting into the book, but I would have never imagined how much I would cringe and think ""ew"" while I was reading it. Yep - ew. Ew ew ew! Just ew."
"77",76,"Nasrin","بعد از آن همه حرف و حديث و ذوق از چاپ كتاب أصلا ذائقه ام را تحريك نكردترجمه را دوست نداشتمناگهان وسط يك متن روان واژه نامأنوسي بود كه هنوز هم نميدانم اثر خلاقيت مترجم است يا سبك ناباكوف در اين كتاب و در ضمن مدام بايد سري به انتهاي كتاب ميزدي و از انبوه إرجاعات به تك بيت هاي شاعران چيزي سر در مي آوردي كه براي من فارسي زبان چندان جاذبه اي نداشتهمه اينها اما مهم نبودمهم اندوه خفه كننده اي بود كه در هر صفحه كتاب راحتم نميگذاشت"
"78",77,"Olga","For most this book gets a 5/5, and I think the writing is exceptional, I do, but it still just sits strangely within me. I still think about it, though I read it years ago, and that too says something. So I want to give it a higher rating, but just can't, though I think Nabokov is incredible, this is where it stands with me. "
"80",79,"Filomena","Finally finished! Two and a half star. Vážně nevím, co víc říct. Příběh byl pěkný, poutavý, sem tam zajímavé přirovnání, ale. Děsně rozvlekle napsané se spoustou popisů, které děj rozvolňovaly až se stával nudným či nepřehledným. Kdyby neměla knížka 319 stran, ale jen půlku, dostala by hvězdiček daleko víc. Je mi líto, ale tahle klasika mě prostě moc neuchvátila."
"81",80,"Mohar","A very controversial subject indeed. Tried empathizing with the author by somehow can't relate to such a relationship. The language is simply great."
"82",81,"Tim Cronin","The problem with Lolita is that no matter how beautiful the prose, and it is, is that not everybody desires to sit through 300+ pages detailing Humbert's yearning to, among other things, have sex with a 12 yr old. It may be great writing, but that doesn't mean it's a pleasure to read, so it defeated the point for me. Honestly, I couldn't wait until it was over so I could move on to something else. But to each their own."
"83",82,"Tricia Long","Great writing, but I couldn't get past the terrible things happening in the novel. Wish I could have, it was so beautifully written and translated."
"84",83,"Ariel Bourque","If you like pretentious and experimental literature that makes you cringe and ends with an Author's overly defended note of braggadocio, then here. Take it away. From me. "
"85",84,"Arsen Zahray","The book is ok at best. The author's writing style is interesting, and he argues persuasively that it's not a really bad thing to have sex with teenagers/children. I concur. In my opinion, what he did wrong was rather having an abusive and controlling relationship with another person. Which is not rare. For some reason, this book is really famous. I honestly can't see, why."
"87",86,"Tessa","Half enjoyed. Why do people name their kids after this book?"
"90",89,"Cheylianie","I thought I would enjoy this book, I was wrong. I know it's a classic, but what can I say? It didn't capture me. Maybe I'll go back to it later in my life."
"95",94,"Redgeorgiadawg","I hate to say that I read this book. I'm glad I read it before I was the mother of two small children. I can't imagine they feelings it would evoke at this stage of my life. I wanted to heave it across the room at times. It was ok. The writing style very specific to this author. Great discussion if you can stomach the subject matter. "
"96",95,"Lori","I did a google search ""why is Lolita considered a classic?"" Read a few blurbs, but not sure I agree. Some reviewers said if you read it twice, you're more likely to ""get it"" and because the second time you're less shocked by the pedophilia. Well written but...eh..."
"97",96,"Eva Hendrix-shovlin","Dakr, disgusting, and disturbing. A well written nightmare"
"99",98,"Mohamed Fayçel Ben Ismail","لا أفهم هل أن سر شهرة هذه الرواية بسبب توقيت صدورها و الجرأة الزائدة في معالجة ضاهرة ليس من السهل التكلم فيها في أواسط القرن العشرين أم أن القراء وجدو فيها ما لم أجده !!! قررت الإطلاع عليها بعد مطالعة "" أن تقرأ لوليتا في طهران "" لآذر نفيسي و كان الأجدر طبعا أن أبدأ بـ "" لوليتا "" .. طبعا أدبيا و لغويا الرواية جدية بكاتبع شهير كنابوكوف أما الموضوع و التفاصيل فبعيدة كل البعد على أن تثير إعجابي .. "
"100",99,"Caitlin Trepp","This book was really hard to read due to the wordiness and subject matter. I followed along as I read with Sparkpeople but I didn't feel the connection. I don't feel how this book is really elevated to the level of classic literature."
"102",101,"Andrew M","Pretty and revulsive lyricism, undue hype. "
"104",103,"John C.","The first half is disturbing, funny, and compelling. The second half is not. I don't like it when people have the gall to refer to bona fide classics such as this as ""boring,"" but to be honest, that's all most of this book was for me. Very easy to put down. Hard to pick up again. "
"105",104,"Kat","This is an excellent book which I can't stand, because it does far too good a job of getting into the mind of a pedophile. I can't read it without feeling disgusting; my body shivers with the chills of his descriptions of little girls. I don't have any sympathy for Humbert Humbert, and I'm not sure that you can. I know many people respect and critique Lolita, but it simply is too creepy to read. "
"110",109,"Jacqueline","""Лолита"" - ами, сложна работа. Роман, който ми бе изключително трудно да харесам... и същевременно да не харесам. Това е първият ми сблъсък с Набоков, от чийто талант съм впечатлена- дарбата на този човек да пише толкова изящно бе единственият ми стимул да не захвърля книгата още в самото ѝ начало. Често почти забравях отвращението си от Х.Х. заради очарователните му (на моменти почти поетични) монолози. Например един тенис мач- нещо толкова обикновено и нормално, Набоков шлифова по неузнаваем начин, разигравайки го през погледа- или по-скоро през сърцето- на Х.Х.:Преди сервиса, преди да се задействува, Лолита сякаш си поемаше дъх, престояваше два-три такта отвъд бялата черта и при това понякога тупваше веднъж или дваж топката или с връхчето на бялата си обувчица чукваше веднъж-дваж по земята, винаги се държеше волно, винаги си оставаше спокойно весела — тя, която рядко би ваше весела в тягостната за нея домашна обстановка! Според мен играта й на тенис представляваше най-високата точка, до която едно младо същество може да издигне сценичното изкуство, макар че за нея вероятно това представляваше само геометрична същност на основната й житейска действителност.Изящната яснота на движенията й намираше слухово допълнение в чистия, стегнат звън на всеки неин удар. Щом попаднеше в аурата на нейната власт, топката ставаше по-бяла, пъргавината й качествено по-скъпоценна. Прецизният инструмент, който тя употребяваше, изглеждаше в мига на гальовния допир невероятно точен и спокоен. Нещо повече: стилът й беше съвсем вярна имитация на най-първокласен тенис, лишен обаче в ръцете й от каквито и да било практически резултати. Както ми каза Електра Голд, сестрата на Едуза, изумителната млада треньорка, когато веднъж седях на коравата пейка, започнала да пулсира под мен, и гледах как Долорес Хейз без усилие разтяга по целия корт миловидната Линда Хол (която впрочем я победи): „Вашата Доли има монтиран магнит за топката точно в средата на ракетата, но ей богу, защо е толкова учтива?“ Ах, Електра, защо не — при такава грация! Помня, когато присъствувах при играта им, почувствувах как поглъщането на тази красота буквално ме облива с едва поносими тръпки. Моята Лолита имаше навика леко да повдига полусвит в коляното ляв крак при размаха, и пружинирането в началото на цикъла сервиси, когато се развиваше и за миг се изопваше в лъчите на слънцето живата равновесна мрежа между четирите точки — поантата на този крак, едва обвитата в мъх подмишница, загорялата ръка и далеч назад отметнатият овал на ракетата, докато тя извръщаше блесналите зъбки на усмихнатата си уста нагоре към малката планета, увиснала толкова високо в зенита на силния и строен космос, създаден от нея с определена цел — да го нападне със звучен плясък на златния си камшик. Подаването й беше прямо, красиво, младо, с класически чиста траектория, но въпреки бързото й темпо не беше мъчно да й се върне, защото нямаше нищо измамно или умишлено в продължителния подскок на топката й. За да бъда напълно честна обаче- сюжетът ми се стори меко казано отвратителен. И да, това ми субективно мнение изобщо не ми попречи да осмисля художествената стойност на книгата/ да оценя посланията, които носи/ да взема предвид времето и обстановката, в което е писана/ и т.н., и т.н. С елегантната си, фина, чувствителна натура, Х.Х. не ми стана по-малко противен. Бях чела някъде, че ""A gentleman is simply a patient wolf."" В ""Лолита"" видях ужасната деградация на този ""patient wolf"" от gentle до mental. И не, за разлика от останалите вдъхновени, умилени, прекланящи се etc. читатели, не изпитвам и капчица състрадание към Х.Х. Твърде тънка ми се струва границата между изпепеляваното му от сбъркана любов сърце и умопомрачения му, болен мозък. Самият Набоков споделя следното в тази връзка:В една свободна страна, разбира се, никой истински писател не е задължен да тегли черта къде свършва чувството и почва чувствеността. Романът ми има доста препратки към физиологичните нагони на извратения човек — не мога да отрека това.(...) именно сцените, в които празният безделник би съзрял разпасана чувственост, всъщност представляват конструктивно необходим елемент за развитието на трагичното повествование в неотклонното му движение към онова, което единствено може да бъде наречено морален апотеоз.Образа на самата Лолита все още не мога да подложа на окончателна ""присъда"". Тя си е просто дете- и ми се струва, че не трябва да я виня, въпреки масата обвинения, които прочетох, че всъщност тя е тази, която е прелъстила ""бедния"" Х.Х. Трябва да се запозная с повече критика (и коментари от самия Набоков), за да си избистря още някои моменти около полюсното ѝ - ту плашещо зряло, ту стряскащо детинско поведение.В общи линии, не бих могла да обобщя мнението си за ""Лолита"" по-добре от казаното в самия предговор на романа: Отчаяната честност, която искри в изповедта му, ни най-малко не го освобождава от отговорност заради дяволската му изобретателност. Той е ненормален. Той не е джентълмен. Но колко магично пеещата му цигулка поражда у нас нежно състрадание към Лолита, кара ни да се увличаме от книгата въпреки отвращението си към автора! Приятни цитати от книгата, мъничко доказателство за нежния ""размах"" на Набоков:Всичко това е много интересно и допускам, че вече виждате как се разпенва устата ми пред припадък — обаче не, нищо не се разпенва, просто издухвам разноцветни мехурчета от щастливи мисли в съответната чашка.***Чувствах, че животът ми има нужда от някакъв потрес.***Явно бе от жените, чиито полирани думи могат да отразят дамски читателски кръжец или дамски кръжец за бридж, но душата не могат да отразят; жените, лишени напълно от чувство за хумор, всъщност напълно безразлични към тези десет-дванайсет теми за салонен разговор, които са им достъпни, но твърде придирчиви към правилата на разговора, през слънчевия целофан, на който ясно избиват стаени, потискани и немного апетитни неща.***oгледах я през мъглата на отказа си***и сетне без никакво предупреждение под сърцето ми набъбна синя морска вълна***„Ces matins gris si doux…“***Все пак този четвъртък бе запазил за мен капчица мед в жълъдовото си калпаче.***Докато наблюдавах това със самостоятелната яснота на бъдещия спомен (също както гледаш нещата с усилието да ги видиш такива, каквито ще си ги спомняш по-късно)...***И през цялото време усещах малкия си индивидуален пожар вдясно от мен: тържествуващото й око, пламналата й буза.***„Ах, прости ми, душице моя, моя ултравиолетова душице — казах аз и напразно се мъчех да уловя нейния лакът; а понеже исках да сменя разговора — да сменя прицела на съдбата, боже мой, боже мой (...)***Разбира се, ще се боря.

There were some points where the polt was strong and intriguing and Nabokov's poetic prose style was very nice to read sometimes. On the other hand, though, our protagonist Humbert Humbert spends what seems like eternities doting on Lolita and describing ad nauseum the details of young ""nymphet"" and their relationship.One of the classics, but one you should probably only pick up if you have a stomach for gross overdescription and doting and can get by with only snatches of intense plot here and there.*-This was the Just For Fun Book Group's selection for August 2010, nominated by me.*-This is #4 on The Modern Library's 100 Best Novels."
"118",117,"Irene","I read the Indonesian translation. It was awful... Then I got bored trying to emphathize the main character personality. Yeah man, whatever. I had to put down the book many times and sighed... And then I found it more interesting and motivating to try to understand Lolita's personality. That's how I kept going and finished the book. More likable, since I met many pedophile victims in my work. Still, this book doesn't make me forgive pedophiles easily. Not even a tiny bit more. "
"121",120,"Brook","Way too disturbing for me. I kept reading it because it was a classic, but this is the type of bone chilling novel that is not a ""read again""."

"125",124,"Miranda Gomez","I couldn't finish reading this book, I stopped at page 38. In my opinion I though the book was really boring and creepy. I did not enjoy this book, the narrator was getting on my nerves. I feel bad for not being able to finish the book and I want to but I just can't bring myself to do it. Sorry"
"126",125,"Ana Clara","I read this as fast as I could, I wanted to get it over with. As soon as I started reading I knew I had probably made a mistake, and this book wasn't for me. I kept reading because everyone talks about how great the writing is [it's good, but nothing much, in my opinion (I did read a translation, and who knows? maybe it was a bad one)]. I read because I wanted to know what happened to Dolores, and I just don't like DNF'ing books.I don't understand why people like this book. I get that it's not the SUBJECT that they like, but the writing, the way it's put together, and etc. I've read some reviews explaining, but I still don't get it. I saw none of what they talk about (again, maybe the translation. Maybe my head was too clouded with disgust: for what was hapening, for the way Humbert blames it on everyone but himself, for how he tries to portray himself as some hero just because he was so against actually having sex with the girl because she was just ""so pure"", for how he takes advantage of her vulnerabilities, for how he thinks he's better than the other older guys who look at her, for how he romanticizes this relationship that is everything but romantic, for how he keeps making her travel with him as to not get too involved with anyone else, for how he gives her money if she does certain things, etc. I could keep going for ages).It's weird, because I don't really feel like making a long review. Usually, when I don't like books, I have thousands of things to say, but with this one, I'd rather just not say it, or not say too much. I'm sure it's been said before, by people with more knowledge and control of the english language than me. Let's just say it made me very uncomfortable, it made me wonder all the time why was it even written, and why it was some people's favorite book. Leave it at that."
"127",126,"Kelsey","Yeah yeah, I know it's a classic...but I much preferred Nabokov's _Ada, or Ardor_. Maybe if I had read _Lolita_ for a class I'd feel differently. Next on the Nabokov list? _Pale Fire_."
"130",129,"lahvyndr","If you can cast aside the mental/emotional/social disturbance of the narrator, this is a beautiful tale of the American Road Trip, with great craftsmanship in language and meter.I've been learning that Nabokov's main plot arcs are not actually the foci of his books. It's a tough lesson to learn."

For me, reading it was not a walk in the park, and I was so glad when I was able to finally put it down. It's actually quite a sad book where everyone seems to be headed to self-destruction. Maybe I'll read it again in a few years to see if my opinion of it will change. "
"138",137,"Steph","Lolita follows Humbert Humbert who moves to America after a stint in a mental hospital and a failed marriage. He stays in a small town where he rents a room owned by Charlotte Haze who has a 12 year old daughter, Dolores aka Lolita. Humbert immediately becomes infatuated with the young girl and plots to have her all to himself.I've had this book for around five years now. I tried to read it when I was 15 but I found it quite hard to read, not for its content, but just the language and the way it's written. So coming back to it now, not much has really changed. I am in two minds about it, I found it incredibly hard to read yet I thought it was an interesting plot. There were times when I found the style of writing to be beautiful and then I'd just get lost again and think, ""What the hell is going on here? Is this part of the story or what?' I found that I couldn't wait to find out what happens next which is always a good thing.As I said, I mostly found it hard to read but I also found the characters to be extremely irritating. Lolita is such an annoying little harlot, Humbert slightly psychotic and delusional and the rest of the characters are just blah. Rather than give this review one stars, I gave it two because of the general plot."
"139",138,"Iceman","Lolita, luz da minha vida, fogo da minha virilidade, meu pecado, minha alma. Lo-li-ta"".Assim se inicia um dos romances mais polémicos de sempre e aquele que marcou toda a carreira literária de Vladimir Nabokov.Nabokov nasceu em 1899 na cidade russa de San Petersburgo no seio da aristocracia. Em 1919, devido à Revoilução Bolchevique, a sua família é obrigada a abandonar a Rússia, refugiando-se em Inglaterra. Nabokov matricula-se então na famosa universidade de Cambridge onde se licencia em 1922 em literatura russa e francesa. A partir daí, Nabokov saltita de lugar para lugar. Primeiro Berlim, depois Paris e em 1940 e para fugir aos nazis, parte para os Estados Unidos da América, onde se dedica a leccionar literatura russa, além de trabalhar em tradução de livros e no departamento de entomologia de Harvard.Profundamente pedante, chegando mesmo a afirmar: ""penso como um génio, escrevo como um autor distinto e falo como uma criança"", Nabokov desprezava escritores que, segundo ele, escreviam literatura ideológica e politicamente correcta. Assim odiava escritores como Thomas Mann, Balzac, Dostoievski, Gorki e Kafka, dizendo insolentemente deste último que a sua obra ""Metamorfose"" era um excelente livro de dissecação de insectos... Em suma, tinha fama de misantropo, a mania da superioridade e era completamente intratável, ou seja, e digo eu, era um completo Palhaço!E pergunto: Como é que este senhor consegue escrever uma obra que é considerada como um dos clássicos da literatura?Mas após a leitura deste livro, entendi porquê.Como classificar Lolita? Narrado em jeito de memórias, uma forma que torna sempre uma história credível, ""Lolita"" é uma trágica confissão de Humbert Humbert, o protagonista-narrador, que na prisão e antes de enfrentar um julgamento por homicídio, resolve contar as suas memórias em relação ao grande amor da sua vida. Narrado sempre na primeira pessoa, ""Lolita"" é um conto chocante que descreve os pensamentos e acções de um pedófilo.Humbert é um pedófilo. Tem 42 anos, europeu, professor de literatura inglesa que, depois de algumas aventuras amorosas na Europa, chega à América com o intuito de apagar o seu passado no velho continente. Acaba por se instalar numa pequena cidade onde aluga um quarto em casa de uma viúva quarentona chamada Charlotte Haze, que tem uma filha ainda criança: Lolita, 12 anos.Nessa altura e devido aos seus pensamentos, apercebemo-nos que Humbert gosta de crianças a quem ele chama de ninfetas e percebemos, dentro do possível, o porquê dessa paranóia.Mas Humbert começa a desejar Lolita, pensamentos libidinosos começam a percorrer a sua mente. Só pensa nela e imagina-se já envolvido com ela. Posteriormente Humbert apercebe-se duma inclinação de Mrs. Haze em relação a ele e, é precisamente através desse casamento que ele se aproxima de vez de Lolita, pois passa a ter “poderes” sobre ela enquanto padrasto.A narrativa segue o seu pervertido rumo com alguma sensualidade e humor, no entanto o tomo é sempre chocante, a paixão de Humbert é avassaladora, doentia, obsessiva. É curioso o pormenor com que Nabokov analisa a mente de Humbert. Ele efectua um exame profundo da mente do pedófilo, inquietando-nos com o que extraí, as conclusões vai-nos chocando, ferindo e é impressionante o seguinte contra-senso: tem a capacidade de nos convencer que a pedófilia pode não ser tão aberrante, tão doentia como podemos julgar, podendo mesmo ser uma forma de amor. É impressionante mas é verdade. Nabokov joga literalmente connosco, com os nossos preconceitos, com os nossos medos e, depois de entregar o jogo, volta a tirar as cartas e baralha novamente. Repara-se que ele atinge o auge do chocante e do aberrante quando descreve os diários e sucessivos abusos (quase violações) de Humbert a Lolita, [que diga-se também de passagem, não era nenhuma ingénua ""colegial"" de 12 anos] Humbert deseja até engravidar Lolita para que pudesse dar à luz uma ninfeta, para, obviamente, futuro deleite de Humbert. É asqueroso! Mas depois Nabokov dá completamente a volta a este sentimento.Mas será ""Lolita"" um simples livro erótico, pedófilo, pornográfico ou psicológico?Claro que não!Este livro é escrito com um objectivo.Nabokov (um autêntico palhaço) odiava Freud (o homem devia odiar toda a gente), considerava-o um bacoco primitivo que falava por clichés e sem pingo de inteligência. Assim criticava a psicanálise e a psicologia e este livro é simplesmente uma paródia a estas duas ciências. No livro, Humbert (Nabokov) goza com os psicólogos, indo ao ponto de afirmar que inventava sonhos para os psicólogos descodificarem. A forma como Humbert vai narrando os acontecimentos, os seus impulsos sexuais, a sua obsessão por crianças, é notoriamente uma paródia a Freud e à sua psicanálise. Existem também uma série de enigmas presentes em todo o texto, assim como frases com segundo sentido. No romance surge uma personagem feminina que se chama Vivian Darkbloom que é um anagrama de Vladimir Nabokov, ou seja, um autêntico jogo criado por alguém que era mestre de xadrez e que pretendeu fazer deste livro um género de quebra-cabeças. E repare-se que afirmo que isto pelo que fui lendo sobre a obra, porque eu próprio não dei conta de alguns pormenores que afirmam estarem lá colocados estrategicamente.Independentemente de quaisquer considerações sobre esta obra, independentemente daqueles que afirmam ser este livro uma obra de arte escrito de uma forma genial, eu vejo-o como um livro onde um escritor arrogante brinca e manipula, brilhantemente é um facto, o leitor. Um livro onde o escritor mandas às malvas simples regras éticas e humanas, descrevendo a mente nojenta de um pedófilo com uma finalidade objectiva: Chocar e achincalhar outros personagens destacados doa sociedade da altura.Por isso, para mim, Nabokov foi um palhaço! "
"142",141,"Jami","Hard to get through, I now know why this was a ""banned"" book. Yucky"
"143",142,"Leona Storey","  “Words without experience are meaningless.”  This isn’t going to be a nice review. I’ve never been happier to have finished a book - not because it was good or anything, but because I’m so goddamn glad I never have to read any of Humbert Humberts’ words again or hear his stupid, over-the-top story. Christ, first of all, I just want to say, has Nabokov ever heard of this thing called a paragraph? One of his paragraphs lasted two flippin’ pages (I’m trying not to swear here - I really dislike this book). Two pages!!! Who does that? Upon seeing it, I physically groaned and shut the book. I couldn’t be bothered for it.Humberts’ endlessly descriptive narrative was so tiresome and unnecessary. It made the story so hard to follow. The last couple of chapters were practically unreadable, I had no idea what was going on. Revisiting places of something or other, and then a really misplaced crime that felt like it had been stuffed in there because Nabokov realised that 100 pages of his book had no relevance and he was trying to make me care for his perverted and boring story.Honestly, a book about a paedophile’s obession with the twelve year old Lolita should be way more interesting than it was. Not in a sick way, but that sort of topic is something that 99% of writers wouldn’t dare touch with a bargepole, so of course you are naturally intrigued to see how someone writes about it - but never was I so disappointed. He started so well, and had me going well for about 100 pages, but after that it was so… pffft.Perhaps I’m not clever enough to appreciate this book, though I can say without a doubt that Nabokov is an interesting and skilled writer, he just didn’t execute this well enough. And knowing that English is his third or fourth language, it is some flawless writing. (He knows more words than I do!)Besides all this, I feel like the reason this book was banned in the first place wasn’t because of the disturbing subject, but because it was pure and utter drivilling crap. "
"144",143,"Brett Mullane","The book has its moments mostly in the first half, but overall this book is repetitive, self-serving rubbish. Can't recommend to anyone. "
"146",145,"Danielle Allen","I wanted to like this book. Nabokov's prose is eloquent and I really enjoyed his storytelling style. However, I just couldn't get over my disgust for the protagonist, a proud pedophile. It took me an incredibly amount of time to finish this book, considering its length, because I had to keep walking away from the book because I found it so disturbing. It would literally bother me for the rest of the day after reading certain sections. Even though I know the book is fictional, I still keep thinking of poor Lolita and everything she went through, and I feel sick knowing that there are people out there like Humbert who have no real self awareness and understanding of the impact of their actions. "
"147",146,"Jim Krotzman","After reading Lolita, I felt dirty as I did after reading Naked Lunch by William Burroughs and Tropic of Cancer by Henry Miller."
"148",147,"Kirsty","I understand why this book has effected the literacy world in the way it had. The book is written beautifully and poetically. It explores lust in the rawest form and introduces a topic which is rarely spoken about. I appreciate the book for the boundaries it has broken conceptually however found the book too over powering with the use of constant metaphors and in depth descriptions. I struggle to move forward and grasp everything that Lolita represents. 2 and a half stars for me."
"150",149,"Paula Laureano","I was really enjoying reading this book until I got to half of it. I was laughing of Humbert Humbert. He was an interesting character. He is mentally ill, but he doesn't know it. The reader follows his ups and downs while he tries to achieve his goal. And he is sarcastic! And its kinda fun. But everything changes when he achieves his goal. It gets disgusting. And boring. And made me stop reading the book. "

"159",158,"Gordforsythgmail.com","Interesting writing style, reminiscent of Poe (probably intentionally so). Drags at parts. Just not that interested in books as psychological portraits."
"161",160,"Jocelyn","read in college. I didn't think it was so scandalous."
"162",161,"Alvi Harahap","It's one of the most complex novels ever."
"163",162,"Madhura","My review may be biased. I am not sure if it's the book or the characters that I didn't like."
"165",164,"Corinne","I don't think this was a very good translation, at least not the e-reader version I checked out from the library. Or maybe it's just me.I know several people who love this book, and I kind of see why if we're just talking about the way Nabokov crafts characters who are so flawed and are incredibly gifted at explaining away their flaws. But the plot creeps me out, so much so that while I would re-read it to try and figure out what gets people all fired up about this book, it's going to take me a while to reach that point."
"166",165,"Tien","I've always been hesitant in picking up this book noting the subject matter. However, it is a classic and seems to be one of the great lit works so it must be worth it to read. It is quite a bit different from my expectation. I really didn't expect 'Lolita' to be who she is and I... DON'T... LIKE... HER. Since I like neither characters, it's really not a book that I favor at all. Still, I have to admit that I do like the ending - what Lolita becomes, Humbert's revenge, etc. I'm not very good at appreciating literary works, I only go with what I feel when I read so therefore, the rating this book earned. If I didn't like the ending, I'd probably only give this book 1 star."
"168",167,"Vinay Kumar","Writing style is good but otherwise it seems to be pornographic material, still a good read."
"169",168,"Afsheen","Finally done. "
"170",169,"Tami Gandt","I didn't see the appeal of this book. It took me forever to finish. "
"173",172,"Terhura Bankston","Although Nabakov is a brilliant writer, this book was a hard read. "
"176",175,"Michael  Malone ","Very surprised by how dull this book was. I'm still unsure what exactly the plot is, and why we should care about either Humbert Squared or Lo--both are sniveling, self-absorbed and a bit hard to root for, while one of them is, of course, an incurable child molester. Nabakov drops the ball in terms of showing Lo's reaction to the death of her mom, and the final scene involving Quilty is a mess. Its saving grace--despite being a complete arse, Humbert is funny: funny in the way your bitchy, snarky, sarcastic friend is funny...in doses. "
"177",176,"Gabriel Thy","This book is serially over-rated as anything beyond the literary culture vulture set, but then again, this is not 1950s USA. The topic is shocking. The psychological profile of a wife-murdering child molester is hardly the stuff of tea room chatter, but it does hold true to the test of groundbreaking literature when even a few women in Tehran find the revolutionary air worth breathing... "
"178",177,"Jonny Amalgamated","Alright... So I only got 49% of the way through it, but I'm done."
"179",178,"Jossalyn","unpleasant story, unpleasant characters, hard to read around this and the self-conscious self appreciation of the author.first read in 1982"
"180",179,"Kadivs","This book was an excercise in boredness. The first 3/5 of the book are really just boring. Over about 100 pages he meets lolita, then spends about 200 pages just traveling around the US with her without anything worth mentioning happening. Just traveling around, some descriptions of the hotels they stay in, some descriptions of activities they did (going to the cinema, playing a match of tennis etc), nothing else.The second part of the book starts out like this as well, but it picks up a bit at around page 300. Then it's actually kind of interesting until the book ends at page 500. If it continued like the part before, it would have been a guaranteed 1 star.The rest, 200 feaking pages, are nothing but several epilogues/afterwords. I haven't read them yet and am not sure if I ever will, but how narcissistic does an author have to be to spend 2/7 (nearly a third) of his book just talking about how he wrote it? Granted, it may be that this part also contains some texts by critics or other authors, I don't know, but still, 200 pages, WTF.I can only recommend this book for people who like to be bored to tears (I fell into microsleep several times while reading it, it's really that boring) or those who like to overionterpret stuff, because this book is ripe with ""symbols"".How this book could ever get so ""big"" I don't know. Probably just because a pedofile as the protagonist was really controversial.I also suspect that most people here on goodreads that actually give this book a positive rating either diddn't read it and/or did it for the same reason people buy books just to fill their bookshelfes without ever reading them (or the reason people buy ""modern art""), that is, to look sophisticated. I bet the people tought ""hey, this book is famous, it's world literature, if I don't give it a favorable rating, people will think I'm a yokel!"".Sure, I may be wrong with that and in some cases someone honestly liked it, but still, I just can't imagine someone actually enjoyed reading that book. I just can't."
"181",180,"Sandra Shergill","Beautifully written and even funny in places, but it's hard to like any character and its easy to hate Humbert Humbert for his hideous cravings, arrogance and sense of entitlement. "
"183",182,"A. E. S.","For all its contrived hype on its sexuality, the book is not very sexual at all, nor is it exciting. Humbert is very human but also an extremely dull, cowardly man. Lolita is who she is without knowing what exactly it is she's doing or its consequences, in other words she obscenely retains her innocence even as she is having intercourse with a man twice her age."
"187",186,"Sunil","The book is written as a memoir of the author recounting his life and in particular his relationships. It is quite disturbing as the author is a pervert. The prose involves the use of very long sentences and such flowery language that it is quite often difficult to tell what exactly the author is talking about. The language is very poetic, however, and this does fit with the passionate tale the author is telling. Definitely worth a read if only to marvel at the use of the english language and at how infatuated one can get whilst in love. I found the interspersed use of french throughout the novel annoying."
"189",188,"Book Worm","Creepy and scary! A nightmare! This book scared the living daylights out of me. As a parent, I loathed Humbert's very existence and hated the book as a consequence!"
"190",189,"Kalle","I have to say that for the most part this book was simply boring. I understand what it perhaps tried to achieve: to characterise the main character, but his inner dialogue and endless ramblings got old rather quickly."
"191",190,"Surendra Dighe"," a story of a insane.Experienced a different type of reading."
"194",193,"Chloe","This should have been a short story. Vladimir Nabokov is revoltingly arrogant and self-satisfied."
"195",194,"Rhonda Nelson","I hate this book. Hate it! If I never hear or read the word “nymphet” again, it will be too soon. Glorified pedophilia is not for me. I stuck with it though because it is on my “Must Read Classics” list. Blah. The only redeeming quality was that I listened to it as an audiobook and Jeremy Irons was inspired reading as Humbert Humbert."
"196",195,"Adrielle Pottle","Disturbing, disgusting and ridiculous. Praised for what I ask? For having a pedophiles in it? Seriously, it baffles me what people find as good literature. Utterly pathetic. Yes this is only my opinion but there is no way on earth I'd recommend this to a soul, classic or not. This was a set reading for me at uni, otherwise I would have never read it and who knows, maybe that has something to do with my distaste. I doubt it though."
"201",200,"Sirine","The plot of the book is really interesting, because it was a new idea to me. I thought it to be creative and bold.But the problem however was in my comprehension of the book since English is not my native language and the author used an elaborate style of writing. This has sometimes caused me problems in understanding what was happening in the story which frustrated me. But I'm sure that if had understood more, I would've liked it even better.Not to forget that H.H and Dolores can both be really frustrating at some points, plus the narration gets boring very often.Their relationship is also very disturbing and H.H is a man of many issues who should seek help.I think I'll try to read it again in a couple of years when my English has improved and when I've forgotten how much it bored me and dragged to end."

""Allí está, no reconocida e ignorante de su fantástico poder.""

Lolita es un clásico que tenía muchas ganas de leer y sin embargo no me sedujo.Empezando con el personaje principal y narrador, Humbert Humbert, a quién odie profundamente.Entiendo que es solo su punto de vista lo que nos cuenta, pero siento que él solo quería saciar su deseo con un personaje prácticamente inventado en su cabeza, sin importarle nada más que eso, ni siquiera lo que pensaba o sentía la propia Lolita. (view spoiler)[Aunque, menos mal, casi al final se da cuenta de sus errores y los admite:""Ahora, hurgando en mi memoria, recuerdo que en esa ocasión como otras similares, mi costumbre era ignorar los estados de alma de Lolita y consolar a mi propia alma vil.""
 (hide spoiler)]La narración me gustó, pero tiene demasiadas descripciones, cosa que al principio no me molestaba, pero una parte en la mitad del libro es solo eso: descripciones y nada de acción, entonces llegó aburrirme mucho.

""Lo bestial y lo hermoso se juntaban en un punto.""

Yo pensé que iba a encontrarme un personaje que me iba a quedar grabado por mucho tiempo, pero sin embargo, no le encontré nada especial a Lolita. Para mi solo fue un personaje sufrido que deseaba tener una vida normal, nada más.Sé que es una obra para analizar muy profundamente, pero sino logra cautivarte no hay nada que hacer, y a mi no logró hacerlo.

"207",206,"Víctor Gutiérrez","La premisa es buena pero el libro es muy aburrido."
"209",208,"Jennifer Rayment","Mini Book Review: This was a constant struggle for me to get through. I basically would read a chapter a day and that was about all I could handle. It is extremely well written and Nabokov had a brilliant way of describing even the littlest thing so well that you could close your eyes and see it. It is also a book that can lead to some passionate discussions. That being said, I truly did not like it. The characters were reprehensible, the subject matter depressing and icky and it just went on and on. As with most classics there is detailed character development and flowery descriptions which are not to my particular tastes. I like a good story, makes me less of an intellect I know, but I am not going to be something I am obviously not. At least I can say I read it and can discuss it in greater detail -- but I can guarantee you I will not be reading it again.1.5 Dewey's (Based on my enjoyment of it NOT the talents of the author)I read this because it was part of my BBC Top 100 Challenge. I borrowed this copy from Sheridan College (Through Inter-library Loan -- Love my job).

"214",213,"Loren","Read it out of curiosity, not my kind of book though."
"215",214,"Rochelle","It took me three months, and about five books in between, to get through this rambling hot mess of a book. I appreciate Nabokov's style, and will admit to reading some of his prose passages that I thought were pure delightful, but so much of the narrative was bloated and excessive. The book opened strong, and I liked the literary device of framing it as a memoir, but the subject didn't enthral me and characters were flat. To be clear, however, I wasn't disengaged because I was prudishly taken aback by the subject matter. If that were the case, I would have had more of reaction than indifference and apathy. No, I was simply bored, and am still puzzling how the good folks at Vanity Fair called it, ""The only convincing love story of our century."" I could name a hundred more convincing than Lolita."
"216",215,"Dorottya Szabó","I experienced the difference between reading a good storyteller and reading a good story. And he also wasn't a great character (well, he was but that is not the point), the way he writes is great. And how he acknowledges all thoe thing he didn't know or just told himself to believe! But it didn't connected with a great story it could be just some practice for him. I don't know, still i really enjoyed it. "

"222",221,"Lua Limaverde","Ao dar duas estrelas para um clássico como esse sinto-me como se estivesse ofendendo as pessoas que amam o livro ou ofendendo a mim mesma, como se eu não tivesse sensibilidade para entender a beleza do livro. No entanto não posso fugir do fato de que minha leitura foi penosa. E não foi penosa como eu pensei que seria devido ao tema, foi penosa porque não me envolvi, porque a bela escrita não foi suficiente para me prender, para me conquistar e olha que até gosto de uma história em que quase nada acontece e a escrita é o que se sobressai.Lembrei-me de O Colecionador, de John Fowles, uma história semelhante em que o narrador também é um homem obsessivo, egocêntrico e cruel e neste eu senti tudo que pensei que iria sentir ao ler Lolita: repulsa pelo personagem mas uma vontade irresistível de continuar lendo. No livro de Nabokov eu não via a hora de tudo acabar, mesmo não dando muito importância a como iria acabar. Uma pena que não tenha funcionado pra mim."

"226",225,"Alyssaluca","This book for me was a difficult one to read. The the first part of the story (the part where Charlotte was married to Humbert) wasn't bad, as I felt there was something to read next, and that I was waiting for the big reveal of Humbert's secret love affair for their daughter. But no! It happened, she died, it was dramatic, and I'll say that was great. But the rest of the book bored me (and that was the majority of the book). It could be that I am only 14, and the description in this book lost me many times, so there's the chance I'm just too young for the book. It droned on, and I was getting to the point of just finishing it! In saying all of this though, the main story line of the book was exceptional. It was different from most things I've read, and (only the first part of the book) really grabbed my attention."
"227",226,"Neil Denham","Well, that was interesting! Read this for a book group, can't say I enjoyed it, but can see why it has become a classic. Reminded me a bit of Fear and Loathing in it's style.May take me a few weeks to formulate what I think of the book, and will be interesting to discuss with other about it. "
"229",228,"D. A.","I discussed this book over a great french dinner. Although the subject matter was hard to read, Nabakov did an excellent job with the characterization of Humbert. As awkward as it felt, I knew this man. At times he made me laugh and at others he made me wince. So much so, that I was unable to finish it. It's not a favorite, but I can understand why it is a classic."
"234",233,"Amani","Nabokov is a master prose stylist, and this book is worth reading for that alone. But I find the relationship between the two main characters disturbing. Dolores Haze is going to have to spend a fortune in therapy to get over what Humbert did to her."
"236",235,"Aleshka","It is a very graphic book but a bad story. "
"237",236,"Brian Levinson","Man, Alfred Appel is a douche. He adds nothing. I sometimes wonder whether ""Alfred Appel"" is a pseudonym for Charles Kinbote (after all, Kinbote once said that all Zemblans are ""apple-cheeked"""" -- a hidden clue?). Anyway, just read the damn regular version of ""Lolita."" Even if you don't speak French, you can pick up what Nabokov means through context.I will give Appel credit for one thing: thoroughly explaining the names in the ""paper chase"" hotel-register sequence at the end of the novel. I have to admit, I didn't understand the significance of ""Dr. Kitzler, Eryx, Miss."" until Appel explained it to me. Now I know it's something to do with clitorises (clitori?). Awesome."
"238",237,"Jenna Garrett","I know its a classic, but this book just creeped me out."
"243",242,"Cristi","i guess i didn't like the plot/story enough to truly see the good writing or finish the last 50 pages"
"246",245,"Chelsea Heath","The subject matter of this book was highly disturbing and it was pretty difficult to follow most of the time. Some interesting writing methods, but mostly a bit confusing."
"248",247,"Mackenzie","Pop culture has completely distorted the plot of this book, so I picked it up with the wrong idea. I wish I had known. Anyway, as much as I trudged through almost all of it, the ending was somewhat redeeming, not just because he gets caught but also because of his murderous pursuit. That scene is probably one of the most vivid and is rather comical. I'm still not sure how I want to rate this as I really struggled getting through it, and I did not particularly like the characters or narrative, but the first several and last few pages of the book are good, Humbert's meditations very human, though definitely disturbing. He may not be a sympathetic character, but his thoughts often ring too familiar.Humbert says of his love for Lolita, ""It was love at first, at last sight, at ever and ever sight"" (270). Then he later admits, ""I simply did not know a thing about my darling's mind"" (284). Love then becomes defined by pure physical attraction and reaction, which is pretty shallow to me. He says he wants to preserve her innocence, yet Lolita accuses him, ""You merely broke my life"" (279) and rightfully so. Whatever feelings he has for her are selfish, and he does nothing to even try to behave appropriately for her sake. I can see how he might think he loves her, but as the jury whom he addresses, it's hard to give him that credit.One might praise Nabokov's use of words, and he does show excellent control over how he uses language. However, he definitely beats the reader over the head with his puns and play on names like Dolores and ""dollhouse"", Humbert and ""humble"", examples that do not even scratch the surface of the theme. It started to feel like the reader couldn't be trusted to catch onto the puns, so they had to be viciously exploited. I won't blame Nabokov for that, as it works with Humbert's own voice, but it was definitely annoying. Only by the end did he seem to trust his jury enough to pick up on his wordplay, or maybe he was just as ready to finish his tale and not spend extra time on his puns as I was.A part of me wants to give this 3 stars for the sake of its weight in society, but I truly did not like it enough to justify giving it so many. Maybe I missed something, but I don't really understand all the hype around this book. Unless it's just the shock factor of Humbert's degeneration."
"249",248,"Yaroslavna","If there is a lesson to take away from this book it is that trying to justify one's actions, by showing everything from one's own perspective, only serves to make the crime committed appear much worse and the offender more despicable. At least Hannibal Lecter did not shamelessly pretend not to know that his actions were wrong and did not place the blame with his victims. Not admitting mistakes is a very unattractive quality which is why, despite the beautiful writing, I simply found Humbert's constant lies extremely unpleasant to read. In the end I have no sympathy for Humbert, no matter how hard he tried to evoke it.“Every man calleth that which pleaseth and is delightful to him, good; and that evil which displeaseth him: insomuch that while every man differeth from other in constitution, they differ also one from another concerning the common distinction of good and evil. Nor is there such thing as agathon haplos, that is to say, simply good...” Thomas Hobbes"
"253",252,"Dugan Maynard","The deranged memoir of a psychotic pedophile-- just a bit of light reading I guess. Overall the writing was fairly good, but I found the number of typos and the quick switches between french and english fairly distracting. I thought the story could be improved if it was ambiguous as to whether or not the narrator assaulted the girl for the majority of the book as I think this would increase the dramatic tension-- as it currently stands it comes off as creepily oppressive.The ending is also quite odd, from the point following Humbert's mental breakdown after Lolita leaves the story takes an oblique turn and we are introduced to secondary characters who are quickly discarded, plots that go no where and a fairly gruesome murder with little build up or explanation.Overall an interesting yet highly flawed read."
"254",253,"Iñigo","Un libro muy extraño, pero con unas descripciones realmente impresionantes. La trama es bastante aburrida, pero el vocabulario que usa Nabokov hace que te olvides que la muchacha que describe con tanto detalle y morbosidad tiene solamente doce años."
"256",255,"Debbie","I largely found this book very boring. Yes, the subject matter was a little racy but that didn't bother me. I listened to this on audio and 11 minutes were spent describing Lolita's tennis game and how she looks when she serves. Some parts were very lovely and poetic, but I was so bored and looked forward to the audio coming to an end."
"257",256,"Sydney","Difficult to read, but everyone should read Nabakov"
"259",258,"Eva Leger","I finished this book. And I only skipped maybe 5-7 paragraphs.I'll say this - if you're like me and you get annoyed by too many details gear up if you plan on reading this. I'll admit though, this book IS the details. Without the over-abundance of details this wouldn't be where it is today.Overall, I'm glad I finally made it through but I can't see myself recommending it and I definitely won't be reading it again."

"265",264,"Liam Bluer","Couldn't get through it due to its wanky, navel-gazing prose."
"267",266,"Charlene Lewis- Estornell","At times, the writing was spectacularly good. It was certainly shocking enough and broke all the taboos; and yet it, was terribly contrived and boring at times. Certainly being able to access and depict the darkest places in one's mind is a rare talent. Nabokov nails that aspect of the depraved human mind. Maybe all the hype set my expectations too high. I am not sure if that is the case of not. I only wish I could get back the hours I spent on this book. "
"268",267,"Thea Landen","I feel the need to point out that my low rating is not due to the subject material, but rather the style of the book. Objectively, I can definitely see why ""Lolita"" is considered a classic, and there are some beautiful, brilliant lines, but there were points where the book seemed to needlessly drag and I struggled with the decision to keep going or not. It was interesting, I'm glad I read it, but I didn't really find it an enjoyable experience."
"269",268,"Shania Tasker","A book about a man with an obsession for girls - or as be calls them Nymphets - between the ages of 9 and 14? Not particularly my favourite story. I personally couldn't (and had no motivation to) finish the book."
"270",269,"Luke Holden","Took me a while to get through this one. Not exactly a bad book as such, but not my thing at all. Writing style was difficult to absorb and I found myself glazing over and zoning out throughout the book. The most interesting part is Humbert's obsession with Dolores and the manipulation and abuse she suffers (although H.H. tries to convince you otherwise) as a result of his infatuation. Overall, pleased I made my way through it, but it left me feeling cold and I'm doubtful the prose will stick with me for any length of time."
"278",277,"Sifra","Yes, I knew what she looked like after the 50th time to explained in length, dear author. I didn't need this other 200 times to fill those pages. The whole story need nothing more than 50 pages in total, and it lasted for 271 pages... UGH"

"283",282,"Layne","This is a book I'm teaching right now. I think it is going to be difficult to teach, but I'm trying to branch out, so we'll see.I do not love Lolita. I can't get past the pedophilia, sorry. But reading it over again, I am noticing a lot more of the puns and allusions that people get excited about; I would say that if you like ""Literature,"" it's worth checking out."

Back on the ""to-read"" shelf it goes."

"289",288,"Sarah Syahirah ","Finally, managed to finish it!"
"293",292,"Justin Mitchell","Yes, Nabokov is a master wordsmith. His writing style is detailed, complex, and vivid. But after reading this book I honestly can't get behind it. Is it possible for a book to be too well-written? I think yes, when the prose itself impedes the reader's understanding of the story, the characters, and the plot, which in the case of this book is exactly how I feel. What are words supposed to do? They are supposed to increase people's understanding of each other and the world they live in. When prose becomes so dense as to prevent understanding as opposed to increasing it, as a form of avoiding communication as opposed to undertaking it, then I feel a writer has failed to do his or her job, and in this case Nabokov gets so wrapped up in linguistic curlicues that he forgets to use his words not for their own sake but as tools of communication. Increasingly, I am moving towards a rejection of writers that write for the sake of writing. Usually, I find they are hiding either a) that they have nothing to say, or b) that what they have to say has very little or no redeeming value. And I just don't feel like Nabokov has much to say in this book; his two main characters are shallow, uninteresting and unsympathetic people drifting through a moral vacuum. And I refuse to allow use of the postmodern trapdoor, i.e. ""but that's just it, the world...has no meaning..."" because I think it is a passive cop-out. Humbert Humbert is a deranged sociopath and Lolita is a self-involved twit, and they live their lives in a decadent, disconnected haze (which is I suppose why Lolita's surname is ""Haze,"" but Nabokov doesn't even manage to make that point clearly). And I'm even open to a serious examination of the psychology of pedophilia or modern alienation and disconnection, or perhaps a questioning of society's sexual mores, but Lolita is none of those things. I'm not going to say it was bad, it wasn't, but it wasn't all that good, either."
"295",294,"Ully","complicated love (is it love or just a dirty passion anyway?) interesting to know that this is based on true story. always love real story"
"297",296,"Kamilah","Don't think I will finish this book. I felt dirty half of the time and other half wondering why the protagonist had such long winded thoughts. Maybe I'm not that deep but I really don't understand how or why this is a classic."
"300",299,"Bella123","I had long been meaning to read this classic and was sorry I did. For me, it was overhyped and way too sickening and disturbing a storyline (have two teenagers myself).

"302",301,"Brandi Piepgras","I've read this book twice now, once with a friend and recently for an English class. Both times I've been left with a sick feeling in my gut, knowing that this is not a book that I will or ever could enjoy. The writing and wording is beautiful, as are the puzzles and culture references weaved into the novel. I can and will accept that those are the reasons that this novel belongs on the list of greats. However, coming from a woman who suffered sexual abuse as a child, this novel is nothing but a nightmare that makes me suffer all over again. The beautiful writing does not take away from the fact that this is a story about a man who prays on a young girl for his own pleasure."

"314",313,"Taryn","I was able to finish ""Lolita"" due solely to Nabokov's superb and clever style...the storyline was revolting, but the narrative was infuriatingly engaging and convincing. Things ended tragically for all of the mostly unlikable main characters and when I read that vanity fair called it ""the only convincing love story of our century,"" I threw up a little in my mouth. I found the writers notes at the end of the novel essential to my being able to concede a two star rating. I do not regret reading it, but I did not enjoy reading this book. "
"316",315,"V.","I didn’t enjoy this book very much. The sexual/moral side of things didn’t really bother me. I think it was quite tastefully handled (considering) and since the story is being told by the perpetrator himself, you don’t expect it to be an even-handed telling.My main issue was with the narrator. I just found him very longwinded and tedious to listen to. I should say, I’m not a very big fan of poetry or language for its own sake. Not that I mind if a writer takes ten pages to tell me something, but I object to having to read ten pages to be told the same one thing ten times. I have the same reaction to people in real life who love the sound of their own voice too much. I realise that Humbert is very much an intentional creation and is meant to be a pretentious snob and a rather pompous narcissist and what-have-you , but to find that amusing you would have to think there was a legitimate, non-pompous version of that sort of character. And I don’t think there is. The guy who insists on telling you a wonderful story in the original Greek can’t be anything else.The story itself was surprisingly mundane. Much travelling around middle America and fretting, lots of fretting. Very repetitive. Would have probably made a great novella. "
"317",316,"James","Although this book is infamous the author, for one reason or another, pulled the punch by making Dolores being already sexually active and even proactive in the case of Humbert. Maybe this was required for the time when this story was written but I find Dolores' proactive participation in her and Humbert's relationship more offensive than the actual relationship itself. That doesn't make the relationship right but it does lessen our revulsion.The story itself seems to me to be of two parts. The first part is pretty good and kept me involved. The second part I found boring and the last section which deals with descent into madness is confusing at best, and possibly allows the reader to experience in a small manner what madness feels like."

"319",318,"Keiley","As I'm sure many of you are aware, Lolita is quite a famous novel. In fact it is a very, very famous novel. And when the entire world insists to me that a book is good, I generally take the time to read it. Particularly when the world insisted that this novel was a moral-breaker. The kind of book that left you standing in that moral grey area of your thoughts in which wrong and right were completely lost. So I was rather excited for this book. Alas, despite starting it in December I have only finished it today. Why, you may be asking, and that is because frankly, I did not enjoy this book. For the most part, reading it was a special sort of suffering, the likes of which I have never before endured.The novel follows the life of a Mister Humbert Humbert, who has a fetis--I mean love for young girls, whom he calls nymphets. He blames this 'love' due to the fact that when he himself was young, his great love, Annabel died. After beginning to live with a widow, Charlotte and her young daughter, Dolores, Humbert finds himself utterly enthralled with Dolores, who he privately nicknames 'Lolita'. Eventually he marries Charlotte in order to stay close to Lolita, but when his wife discovers his love for the child, she threatens to leave him and expose him to the police. So naturally, the woman gets hit by a car and Humbert collects Lolita from school and they travel the country, eventually embarking on a sexual relationship that turns into rape and prostitution fairly quickly.People often tell me that Lolita is a love story. No, it is not. At no point do I believe that anyone in this book loved anyone else in this book, least of all Humbert and his dear sweet Lolita. He was infatuated with her, and she loathed the man. He kidnaps and rapes her, even when she is gravely ill, and blackmails her into remaining silent about their affair. There was none of the moral hardships that I was informed I would endure, apparently I was supposed to be rooting for them, but really, I found Humbert despicable and Lolita to be a whiny brat, a thought that he shares. He detests her entire personality, the only reason he's so 'in love' with her, is because she looks like his long lost Annabel.At least three quarters of the book is spent describing nothing at all. Literally. And about half of that is describing Lolita herself. A quarter describing Humberts woe over the fact that he cannot have her, and even when he does have her, that she is actually a whiny little brat. It's all flowery prose about nothing. Well nothing and the fact that everything Lolita does is so perfect and tempting. At least in the eyes of Humbert.Alas, I could not appreciate whatever value the world seems to think this novel has simply because I found that there was no real plot, the characters were all detestable and if I have to read one more flowery description of Lolita/her beauty/her actions/anything to do with her, I might blow my brains out with a handgun."
"321",320,"Kimberley","I listened to more than half of this book on audio but didn't like it, so didn't finish it. I watched the 1997 version of the movie years ago when I was around Lolita's age and remember thinking it was good and quite a sweet love story. Now in my late 20's, I didn't feel the same way about the book. No matter how poetically written it is, there's no getting away from the fact that Humbert is just a pedophile that lusts after young girls, or ""nymphets"" as he calls them. Although he never took advantage of Lolita against her will, there was something that just didn't sit right with me and made me uneasy.Moral issues aside, I found the book too long winded and a bit boring. I might watch the movie again and see how I still feel about that."
"322",321,"Hollie","I got the creeps from it..."
"329",328,"Willona","I hate this book. It's extremely well written--a true work of art, however, the subject matter is too much for me. It's not a love story. Lolita is 12. And Humbert attempts to slip her a roofie on several occasions... there are so many elements of this story that are not actually related to love that I don't understand how this myth about it being a ""love story"" or a tale of female seduction even got propagated. It's just bizarre to me. But, Nabokov was a skilled and gifted writer and he could tell a story. I find the story itself tragic and disturbing."
"331",330,"Charles Rouse","Read it if you must. Why not. If Nabokov's reputation rests on this, I have some questions for the reputation makers. If there was any other story, in any other context, that involved a twelve year old girl being seduced by a forty two year old man, we wouldn't review the story, we would call the police. Why does Nabokov get a pass on fiction because it is fiction? That's the question. "
"332",331,"Gavin","Paedophile is a bad man and an unreliable narrator. News at ten.No seriously though, the use of language and word games raise the odd smile throughout and yes Nabokov gets bonus points because English isn't his first -or even second- language but again: Praising good prose is like applauding because someone played a lot of notes.The characters are uniformly flat and unlikeable, the plot is repetitive, circular and dull and even with Jeremy Irons reading this thing to me it was an absolute slog that left me feeling 80% bored to 20% uncomfortable."

His pathetic plans and even more pathetic attempts of getting closer to lolita, any lolita.But her mother's death is very disappointing. This turning point in the story seems almost like an afterthought. Of course any active murder on Humbert's part would have been out of character. But couldn't Nabokov have thought up any other passive way of getting rid of her? A fatal accident, just in the nick of time? Come on!The 1st road trip is still interesting to follow, with all the psychology and guilt. but you could as well stop reading after they settle down..."

Although it is extremely well-written, the subject matter of this novel is far too disturbing and disgusting to be enjoyed. Here's an analogy: This book (Nabokov's critically-acclaimed exposition of sexual taboo) is like an aesthetic statue sculpted from fecal matter. It's like a beautifully polished turd with a repugnant stench. You can only admire it for so long before the smell overwhelms your senses and you turn away. I read only the first fifty pages."

Kada zapravo prica direktno sta se desava, dosta je kul i zanimljivo (razgovor sa Lolitom u kolima, muljanje na kaucu, susret sa Monik...), al' izgleda da je opisavnje americkih vukojebina bitnije od razradjivanja nikad vidjenog odnosa u knjizevnosti.Sta ocekivati od coveka koji u pogovoru kaze da je jedino estetsko uzivanje bitno (sto nisi postao onda slikar? Nazad u deveti krug pakla zajedno sa Mervinom Pikom) i zelja da izbaci knjigu iz sebe. Ok, ok, to be perfectly fair, nije kao da ja ne uzivam u estetskom dozivljaju, al' nemam utisak da Nabokov ima nesto posebne opise. ""Bili smo tamo, videli to i to"", boooring.On pomiminje i ""Za mene prozno umetnicko delo postoji samo utoliko mi pribavlja ono sto cu odsecno nazvati estetskim blazenstvom, to jest, osecanje da sam nekako, negde, povezan s drugim stanjima postojanja gde je umetnost (radoznalost, neznost, dobrota, zanos) pravilo"". Ja jesam osetio neku bittersweet neznost u delu sa Monik jer nekako ima motiv i razlog iza toga (on u nju vidi svoju staru ljubav), dok prazni opisi svake stvari koju vidi usput mi nista ne znace.To be even fairer, citao sam na srpkom, sto sam tek u pogovoru prevodioca shvatio da je kobna greska, posto ima mnogo vise word-play-a u engleskom izdanju, koja nisu mogla da budu prevedena. K'o sto sam Nabokov kaze, ""jedan americki kriticar je nagovestio da je Lolita hronika moje ljubavi s romanticnim romanom.

There's a controversay about did H.H. really love Lolita or was he just a pedophile? I do believe that he really did love her because when she ceased being a ""nymphet"" in age his love was still there. What I had a hard time with was the overly-flowery, hard to understand writing style. So descriptive in such poetic ways which I guess to some might be beautiful but to me was just annoying. I had a hard time following the storyline. Add in the French passages (with no translation) and I really got left out. I don't like feeling left out of a book."
"362",361,"Cryolath"," I think the pictur on the cover for this website is really creep. But, as for the story, you find yourself caught up in the main characters lies and half truths, and sometimes It's hard to find out what actually happened.

It was beautifully written---no doubt about that. But...it had me cringing. Maybe it's the pedo-theme, but I couldn't help to feel weird about the whole situation, which is splendid by the fact that I, as a reader, was able to travel through the mind of a ill-minded person. A pedophile. "
"366",365,"Frank Roberts","First off, the crucifix wearing cashier at Waldenbook's tried refusing my purchase* of the book until I pushed back, pointing out that a bookstore ain't a porn drive-in and it wasn't 1956. After that kind of resistance I just had to dive right in.Kinda dull it was. Didn't take Humbert too long to score with Lolita. And with his groveling neediness and her sniveling bitchiness it didn't take too long for me to wish they were actual people I could punch in the face. A lot.For better Nabokov reading look into his butterfly studies. *This is one of my ""incisive"" reviews based on having read the book more than 25 years ago while still a teen. Nabokov's most famous book did make enough of an impact on me to recall enough to belch out my thoughts...For better fun with sexual taboos try out Jackass On A Camel...

"367",366,"Steven","It just isn't that good."
"368",367,"Ari","2.5 Cuando lo empecé me estaba gustando mucho, pero a partir de la segunda parte empezó a hacerse pesado y monotono. El estilo de Nabokov me ha inspirado y exasperado a partes iguales, y le doy una puntuación de 2.5/5, 6/10 porque voy a intentar ser más crítica este 2016. PD: La primera página del libro sigo (y seguiré) opinando que es el mejor inicio de novela que se ha escrito del mundo (que yo haya tenido el placer de leer)."

"373",372,"Sara.getz Getz","Sigh. I was pretty drained after this book. Thanks to Liz I appreciate the writing a bit more, but felt very caught in the author's head the whole time and wanted to know more about Lolita -- though I must say, the book did do a good job of making me feel trapped by the nuerosis/paranoia/obsessions of the author. So maybe it did its part. I don't know. Not my favorite, but not the worst book ever."
"375",374,"Amro","A well written book but why it's his most popular book, I fined a bit of a mystery. I am a big fan of Nabokov - he's one of my favourite writers - but this is nowhere near my favourite. I found the subject very difficult and the characters unlikeable - perhaps it was just my modern sensibilities. Read Nabokov - but don't start with this one. "
"377",376,"Caitie","The writing is excellent. I personally could not attach myself to the story or the characters. Not a big fan and it did not live up to the hype for me. I don't understand the excitement of my peers over this novel."
"378",377,"Adriana Garza","Esperaba mucho más de este libro. El comienzo realmente fue muy bueno, pero se fue haciendo muy tediosa la lectura, tanto asi que pense en abandonarlo varias veces. Lo recomiendo unicamente porque es un clásico."
"379",378,"Lametria","If it wasn't for Pretty Little Liars, I would have never got as far as I did with this book, but due to the context I couldn't finish it. It's disturbing to read from the point of view of a man that wants to have sex with a child. It's gross. "
"380",379,"Bradley","That was a tough one, I can't say that the story was difficult to read as far as subject matter is concerned but the writing is difficult to read and keep up with. I understand it is supposed to be a memoir of sorts but the constant ramblings and shifting lack structure making the book that much harder to read. I have a hard time recommending this one to anyone I am not sure why I finished reading it. "
"382",381,"Susann","Doesn't matter how much my head can and does appreciate Nabokov's talents. The rest of me feels wretched while reading it. Last read: 2000, approx."
"386",385,"Joc Tay","The pace is slow and I find the description of attraction shallow and at times whimsical. Perhaps this was early in the story and is intended, but those looking for a deeper insight will be disappointed."
"389",388,"Ileana","This book in my opinion was overrated and disappointing. The book itself is amazingly written, very great language and wit, but I can't bring myself to get over how disgusting Humbert is, with his delusions and justifications of his behaviour and blaming poor Lolita for his actions. Also I find some reviews of this book very concerning. How can people feel sorry for him or justify anything he does is beyond me, he is a monster and there is nothing good about him, only the way he speaks. "

Ia pun bertemu dengan Lolita (12 tahun) gadis yg misterius tetapi juga 'nakal'..hmm, petualangan hubungan cinta yg aneh. btw, thx hunny...sebagai kado, novelnya turut memperkaya koleksi aq ;)"
"395",394,"Anissa Rose","This book was written so beautifully. The story on the other hand was quite creepy. Mr.Humbert's thoughts are so horrifying... Seeing into the mind of a pedifile. He is not a lovable character at all. Even though Lolita was quite a brat, I feel terribly bad for her. If you read this book prepare to be disturbed and have a sleepless night."
"397",396,"Melissa Mahle","This book was on my 100-classics-to-read. This book was hard to read and hard to rate. It is beautifully written. The narrative voice is so powerful and the storytelling, with the flash backs woven throughout, effective. I couldn't put it down. But the plot, oh my...as a mother with a daughter of the same tender age. I can understand the outrage at this book when it was published and still today, as it glories a sexual predator. It reminds me of the controversy over the Hunger Games. Can you like the book and hate the concept (kids killing kids)? Apparently, given the popularity of the book and movie. With Lolita, I just could not get past the premise. "
"398",397,"The Book Slayer","I don't think it's a mystery why some adults abuse children. If it's violently or verbally (such as when I was a child tolerating my parents' juvenile name-calling), it's usually due to jealousy. Those kinds of adults had miserable childhoods, and they see you happy and smug, and they decide, fuck it, I'm going to break that little shit's mind. They don't want you to enjoy yourself, they don't want you to succeed and have a happy childhood, a better childhood than what they experienced. But here, in this book, we have an adult abusing a child sexually, and I can only imagine why. There are hints, and I did perceive what the problem was with Humbert Humbert, the remorseful narrator. You could sympathise with him to some degree - he grew up disturbed, losing the love of his life, even if it was just a childhood crush, and now as an adult, he wants to relive that bittersweet youth romance. At least that's what I think this book is about. It's not until about page 150 that Humbert actually has sex with the 12-year-old girl, and even then, it's not really described in any detail and that may or may not aggravate you. It would've been interesting to see how Lolita aka Dolores Haze reacted to these sex sessions, whether she was laughing happily or serious or depressed and hesitant. All we get is Humbert's narration, and as everyone knows, he's so unreliable, how he perceived this little girl can't be accurate. How do we know what she's feeling based on his perception? Many times throughout the book, I got the impression Lolita was actually much younger: nine years old maybe, or even seven years old, based on her playful immaturity, her ignorance towards what was going on and all that. However, that's the nature of the book - you get this record of events from a 1st-person POV, from a man in prison or something, after the crime went down. It's like a diary, although massively lyrical and descriptive in some sense. The story is made sweet and glossy by a madman!It's obvious the author has great command of words, but I was only rarely enthralled by them. I was kinda skimming or fast-reading, going quickly because they're just words without much concrete attachment to the narrative. Not overindulgence, just articulate and wordy for the purpose of painting a picture of a disturbed man. Though it's unlikely you will be repulsed by him or cover your mouth in shock (it's only fiction; no kids were harmed here; it's not real), I imagine most people could identify the lack of depth in the Humbert character, how he's quick to condemn himself but not really get down to the nitty-gritty psychology of child abuse. Its motivations, its repercussions. Again, the sex is all but avoided over the course of the entire novel. I've only ever seen the 1997 movie which also only alluded to the intimate relations between Humbert and Lolita. In the end, I liked some of the language throughout the book, the words, phrase and ideas, but this book is OLD and it's not cutting-edge. I can't imagine the author knows how perverted criminals think - it just seems unlikely. What, he researched child abuse at his library, or visited prisons and talked to sexual deviants? I highly doubt it. All I really learnt from the book was a simple psychology, a clichéd psychology, which anyone could think up if they really tried. The only really provocative idea within the novel that I could see (and something that would never enter the world of Hollywood in a movie adaptation) is when Humbert threatens the kid, saying, ""If you tell the police I'm molesting you, I will end up in prison, but you ... oh boy, you're headed for rehabilitation in a boarding school! The boredom will kill you, Lolita. No more toys and ice creams! But if we continue with our forbidden relationship, I'll buy you nice things, everything a young girl could dream of."" Yeah, that's something totally nasty about this book.Enjoyment Factor: 2 starsMovie Potential: 2 stars"
"399",398,"Anna  (Bananas!)","The subject matter isn't what bothered me. Overall I was just underwhelmed, especially since the book is both lauded and notorious. I expected more shock and awe, I guess. Expectations ruining another book for me? I'm sure that's part of it but certainly not everything. It was funny occasionally so I give it points for that. Neither Humbert Humbert nor Lolita were engaging for me though. "
"401",400,"Jaymie","I don't get it. I don't know what I was expecting when I began to read this book, and I know people are divided on this story. I am one who doesn't get it.Firstly, I didn't like the characters. The only one I liked was Lolita's mother because she was mildly entertaining. I can't get over that the main character, our narrator, is named Humbert Humbert? Really? Was that necessary? And even if it's a double name thing, why on earth Humbert? Anyways, I know his feelings for Lolita stem from a childhood love, but it's just so stupid. Lolita doesn't seem very believable to me. She's really forward and crass for a twelve-year-old, especially towards a middle-aged (or close to middle-aged) man that she barely knows. I can't imagine anyone real her age doing that. Also, she kept striking me as being dirty, not in a sexual way but a cleanliness way. Hey, maybe that's a metaphor for her personality. After a while, Humbert doesn't even seem that attracted to her anymore, and their many escapades and adventures don't seem plausible.I could go on. What I liked about the book is that it's easy to read, and the writing is sometimes poetic (not including the actual included poems, which are also rather nice). "
"402",401,"♡Ann  Matalines♡","I give up. DNF ON CHAPTER 24. I tried so hard to really finish the book. I'm not going to be fickle-minded and judge the remaining of the book. It was hard enough to pick and read this. I'm restoring the innocence of a twelve-year-old girl in my minded. I'm sorry to the girl on the cover. You've been sexually assaulted at my mind."
"403",402,"Laura Jean","This is an excellently written work of literature. For that, would that I could give it a higher rating. I cannot.No matter how well written, I find pedophilia from the viewpoint of the pedophile a disturbing, vile and loathsome topic, particularly when the child/""nymphette"" is allocated the blame.I read this as a precursor to ""Reading Lolita in Tehran,"" to which I shall now move on."
"404",403,"Isabell","I had quite high expectations for this book because it is listed both on the 1001 books you need to read before you die list and on Bloom's Western Canon. Both usually include high-quality literature and so far I've at least liked or seen something good about every book I've read from the lists. Not so this time.This was one of the few books I read in the last year (I actually read it this year, but the new year is still fresh enough that this statement has more meaning when I take my reading experiences of last year into account as well) where I struggled with finishing it. It started very slow, didn't manage to capture me and even repulsed me. I didn't really feel the need to go on or even to finish this book. I eventually did finish it, because I'm bad at not-finishing books. Once I started a book I usually finish it. Otherwise I couldn't really give an educated opinion about it. But the fact that I finished this doesn't make it a good book.The main character Humbert Humbert is a pedophile who ""falls in love"" with his landlady's minor daughter. He knows that he is sick and that what he is doing is wrong but he does it nonetheless. Reading about him (the book is actually written from his point-of-view) made me feel sick.I have to give Nabokov his due in saying that I really liked the writing style and his way of expressing things. I could even have gotten around to seeing some merit in it should it have supposed to be a cautioning example. However, Nabokov said in the afterword explicitly that the book was not thought to have a ""meaning"" in the sense how it is taught in literature classes. If I accept his statement for truth I have to wonder why he wrote this book.This is one of the few pieces of ""literature"" that I can't recommend to anybody else for reading and I'll things twice before I read another work by Nabokov."
"405",404,"Zaki","There is an old french proverb that sais ""don't fart above your arsehole"" and I think I was doing that by trying to tackle highbrow literature like Nabokov's Lolita. Why this book is held in such high regard went right over my head."
"409",408,"Tayla","Lolita reviewThis book took me so long to read due to uni deadlines and also the fact that the language is hard and being potentially dyslexic I found it hard to understand what was going on. By hard language, I mean it is a more traditional piece of literature like something you would be made to read in school for GCSE's with higher vocabularly. However, although the story has a interesting ""judged"" background, from what I understood the story was good but confusing. I'm glad I read it and challenged myself not to give it up. I now want to read Ben brooks version Lolito! Last 3/4 chapters I skim read as I became bored and pretty much knew what was going to happen due to the rest of the book. I won't read it again, but I am glad I can say I stuck through it and finally read it."
"414",413,"Aliccia Rico","executed well, disgusting subject matter."

"421",420,"Margarida","The only good thing about this book is the brilliant way Nabokov writes. The plot is so boring and repetitive that I couldn't find the strength to finish this book."
"422",421,"Julie Bell","Just couldn't get over the main topic. Very distasteful."
"423",422,"LATOYA SAUNDERS","This book is difficult to get through. It's the diary of a grown man who's obsessed with sleeping with a 12 year old. His descriptions of the physical attributes of 'tween' girls and his justifications for his actions actually made me grimace. I think this book is a classic simply because it's so shocking. It's a gleaming example of free speech; perverted, predatory, disgusting, free speech. Well written in the voice of the character but I hated it."
"424",423,"Thespian999","Do not read this book if you cannot keep in mind that the main character is mentally ill. It's very disturbing and it contains very adult content. I wouldn't reccomend this for anyone under a very mature 16. It's not an easy book to read. "
"426",425,"Marianna","My daughter was assigned this book in high school so I read it after she did. As a parent I found this a very difficult book to read. Humbert Humbert is evil for being so ordinary and I think this book makes a paedophile's point of view appear benign which it clearly is not. He ruins Lolita's life which ends tragically as a result of ever meeting him. Awful. I can't believe that it is considered a 'must read' or literature. I think if female professors ruled this book would be dropped from the syllabus. "
"430",429,"Julie Aquilina","Unsettling. Beautifully written, yet riddled with small errors. That's all I can say about it right now."
"434",433,"Abigail","Well written. Disturbing."
"442",441,"Kristyn Shaw","The writing style is great but the story is horrifying."
"443",442,"Missy J","The first time I read this book, I couldn't finish it. It was too disturbing. This summer I decided to finally read this book again and finish it this time. Many people praise this book. However, I still find this book disturbing and the writing not excellent. Wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
"446",445,"Jerry Auld","Two years to finish this book and only by dedicating some days on vacation and counting the pages. With a great and powerful start, it devolves into a poor travelogue and repetitive description (both narrative and expository) that started to sound like a listing out of Vlad's notebook from sitting in diners and trying to capture 1950s America with a listicle. Perhaps it was the age that this came out - the forbidden talk of pedophilia. Now it sounds too much like buzzfeed click bait - just trying to get attention. Although at times the writing is simply beautiful, the story is just not that strong once Humbert possesses Dolly. He should have ended it there. I do not get why this book had such a big impact."
"451",450,"Ida","I really wanted to love this book. Content aside, I just can't make myself like Nabokov's prose. It's pompous and dull and I can't help but feel like I missed something crucial as this book was nothing noteworthy to me. "
"452",451,"Roxy","It took some time to get into the rhythm of the writing. Once i did I was enjoying it and how inticing the story became but about halfway through the story shifted and lost all of its heat. I became so bored that I could not finish it."
"453",452,"Darshana","got only half way through the book. it is amazing the level of english that this book is written in compared to the books these days. though i wasn't really interested being inside the head of a pedophile .. the author does a good job of making you feel humbert's obsession or sickness I'd call it. "
"454",453,"Aksana","Have trouble getting into this book, don't know if it's due to the subject matter. Maybe, will pick up later again."

"466",465,"Ashley Binder","I found this difficult to get through and the story overall pretty uninteresting. I think that makes me some sort of literary hack."
"471",470,"Alana","very different"
"473",472,"Teryll","The cover of my book called it the ""most convincing love story of the 20th century"" but I beg to differ (along with most of the women in my book club). This book was a hard pill to swallow, in addition to the topic of the book, his writing style was hard to get into. Nabakov is successful at one thing in this book - getting into the psyche of his character. Humbert Humbert is a tragic man, can't even really call him a man in my book, and while Humbert wrestles with his inner demons, a child loses her sense of self and youth. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone really, it's disturbing on so many levels, but if you're into the twisted and dark, perhaps this one's for you."
"474",473,"Clare Wang","Okay, let's be frank, I honestly wanted to read this book because of all the hype of how disturbing it was. (YES, DISTURBING THINGS CAN ROUSE CURIOSITY). The beginning- though it was creepy and sick- was interesting in a sense, actually throughout the whole novel, Nabokov tackles some very difficult and sensitive concepts as to how people view what we call a 'pedophile' today. I think Nabokov, in this novel, successfully demonstrates that there is more depth to be discovered to the term 'pedophile', that Humbert is not just some crazy man who fantasizes about girls all day. He has a depth to him. HOWEVER, what really wore me down was that Nabokov spent the WHOLE book writing about how crazy Humbert is about Lolita. With all that buildup in the beginning, one would expect something to happen in the end, but noooo, Humbert fails in a sense and continues to live a sad life. This perhaps, is Nabokov's method of conveyed the idea of the harshness of reality or some further deeper meaning which idk man. There is some great sections of detail and description in the novel as wellOverall, a strange but creepily memorable book. I only wish there was more of an development and for the book to be in ENGLISH ONLY. (I can't speak french) "

"478",477,"Luciana Guerra","Eu queria dar duas estrelinhas e meia, mas não tem essa opção... Sinceramente eu acho que minha leitura meticulosa estragou um pouco o livro, então acho que o livro ganharia muito em uma releitura, que eu pretendo fazer em algum fim de semana desses..."
"479",478,"Eleanor","My brother gave me Lolita, his favorite book, for Christmas this year. Although I enjoyed it more than the Bolano tome my borther gave me two years ago, I didn't love it. It's certainly interestingly written, but it has the same sense of awaiting the inevitable downfall that I find difficult in Tom Wolfe's novels. In addition, I found the driving from hotel to hotel sections interminable and the pedophile stuff hard to take. (I don't love books from the perspective of murderers either.) "
"480",479,"Elaine","Let me quote Ramona Quimby from her infamous book report: ""I can't believe I read the whole thing!"" This book was a trial for me. Abusive (in so many ways) pedophile as the hero of the story? And Nabokov's writing in no way convinced me that he should be pitied in any way. In fact, the long, descriptive, and arrogant soliloquies put me off so much that I just wanted to chuck the book across the room. Glad this one is done."
"481",480,"Reem Lambert","Well i think i've decided to read lolita because of the same reason most people go ahead and read it, its infamous reputation. Putting that aside, the plot was okay, it didn't really appeal to me. I was sort of disappointed at the beginning and i kinda liked it towards the end ( i dont know if its because i was close to finishing it) which is why i added an extra star in my rating. I dont think reading any book, whether we liked it or not is a waste of time. So no regrets there but i still have mixed emotions towards the book. "
"483",482,"Nola Redd","I don't remember being particularly impressed with this book. Of course, I read it over ten years ago."

"487",486,"Vyou","La verdad es que no se que puntaje ponerle a este libro. Le puse dos estrellas porque goodreads me dice que significa que estuvo bien...y supongo que lo estuvo. No tengo mayor problema con la historia porque solo me pareció bleh. Se que es un tema controversial pero no fue por eso que no termino de convencerme. La verdad es que mi mayor problema es con los personajes, no fueron para nada de mi agrado, a tal punto que no podía ni siquiera sentir lastima por lolita. Pero sin duda la narrativa de Nabokov es espectacular, creo que de no ser por su pluma hubiera dejado este libro antes de las primeras 100 páginas."
"488",487,"06MirandaH"," Don't judge me. I blame it on the Police. (the band, not the cops)I was listening to ""Don't stand so close to me"" and decided to look up Nabokov. I read (am reading) this book based on how highly reviewed it is. Lots of people hold the opinion that it is fantastically written. And I agree. Not with the subject neccessarily, but with the writting. Learning new words, going on a moral seeking quest, and feeling guilty reading this is only a few of the perks of this book. I took this to school today to try and finish it and get rid of it before a blemish would appear on my already tarnished social image. However, it is hard to read a book in very large print (the only copy I could find was in large print) and not be paranoid that someone is reading this potentially racy book over your shoulder. (UNRELATED VAGUELY RELATED RANT: As an underage juvenille who CLEARLY has no idea what I'm talking about, this book made me want to change a few laws. It demonstrated a (mostly) consentual relationship between a minor and an adult. I think that the whole ""have to be 18"" rule is total bull. I'm not sugguesting we all go find our own little 12 year old Lolita, but a resonable emotional and physical maturity. If you were just 15 and went out with an 18 year old, you would have gone to school together. You would have the same friends, the same connections,same social interactions, and same or similar life. Instead, the ""adult"" (brains aren't fully developed untill 25, so that should be adult. not the teenager who turned the magic number and still has the same mentality level for the next few years) gets charged with statutory rape and gets charged with a misdemeanor or up to 5 years in jail.END OF UNREALTED VAGUELY RELATED RANT!) Tying all this together again: Humbert, no matter how likeable he was at times, broke the law. BIG time. He extorted her,she extorted him. The little nymphette should go to jail to. Lolita's actions where completly out of control and highly manipulative. I have sympathy for him, but I havent reached the end yet and found out what happened. Lolita runs away with another adult, whom Humbert calls ""Trapp"" (I'm not sure if that actually is who he is because I'm tired and kind of skimmed. pinky promise I'm going to analyze it this weekend in depth and detail.) If I met this chick, I would slap her. She is a little slut! And, she basically set in motion the dominos to ruin Humbert's life, and then runs off and does this to some other poor bloke! (off to finish the rest)Update: I've been procrastinating reading it, because this book makes me wanna shower a bit more. This isn't a good thing to read, how many people do you know that read Lolita and thought,""Hey. I feel like a better person now."" I'll never be able to look at 12 year old girls the same way ever again. Not even sure I wanna finish it.Update of an update: I don't want people to see my profile and see that I am reading this *wonderful* and *wholesome* book, So I'm gonna just say I finished it. By the way, 12 year old girls are still terrifying. But this is a problem with modern society to. Just go to Classic Skating on a tursday, and the 12 year olds wear less than I do!"
"489",488,"Lword","Wow, this was a very disturbing book. I guess its poetic language and daring subject make it the classic that it is, but it's not a nice story. I read it because it's one of the classics, but had I not, I don't think I would have missed much."
"490",489,"Katrina","I can see why this an important work but I did not enjoy it. "
"494",493,"Troy Lindeman-Wyner","I like this more after our book club discussion. 3 1/2 stars. "
"496",495,"Sander","I was not as taken in, taken away, or caught as I wish I could have been. Nabokov is one of the great American writers of this century and Lolita's topic is fascinating; pedophilia, imprisoning a minor, love and lust, but the book left little impression on me. I am sorry for this."
"497",496,"Katrice","Do not be deceived by my rating. It means absolutely nothing after being only a faint glimmer within a slight manifestation of my reading preferences. This is a beautiful work of art. Indeed Vadimir Nabokov's words remind me of flowers at the peak of bloom out of a dreamy photograph derived from an extremely analogous roll of expired Ferrania Solaris 35mm film. Naturally, his eloquence is admirable (especially considering that he tackles the idea of love. The term ""love"" itself is indefinable, he works his magic around the exact meaning of it- Bravo, Nabokov) but equally amazing is how he weaves extremely effective humor around a dark(?- H.H. was a man in love) subject matter. Artful and painfully clever.. a truly gifted writer. (of course i feel like a pompous fool writing that last line.. I am only me and Nabokov is Nabokov.)"
"500",499,"stephanie roberts","Vladimir Nabokov is an amazing writer and i look forward to reading his other works. This was my fist foray into Nabokov, and I discovered why his prose is revered by other writers, but as strangely engaging as he makes our dark protagonist make no mistake this is a story of a murderous, brutally abusive, and manipulative pedophile. It is crystal clear this is Nabokov's meaning, as well as the protagonist's take on his own behaviour. There is something so vile about the coolheaded way that rape is discussed, that i couldn't help contrasting it to the violence of Saramago and Cormac McCarthy and finding this book more disturbing, because a strangely pretty face is put on the perversity. I think the one reason this book has not been relegated to the darkest corners of the library is that Lolita is an almost supernaturally resilient child that refuses to be overtly destroyed by her captor. But there is a second reason that haunts me. I can't help wondering if the enduring appeal of this book is evidence of a strain/stain through literary academia that wishes to romanticize the actions of a violent obsessive narcissist to legitimize or dignify the darkest desires of male control over vulnerable children. Better to laud a charming literary figure and the educational value of the text, created by the virtuosity of a highly esteemed novelist, than admit ones fiendish dark urges. I think that is why this villian has been enduringly recast as a romantic figure, against Nabokov's explicit condemnation (which even extended to Nabokov insisting that no representation of Lolita be used on the cover yet voila! observe the very cover of this edition).If I had to rate this book on the writing alone, and not the content I would give it five stars, and it's not that I wish I'd never read it the way Saramago and McCarthy have traumatized me in the past (ai yi yi).

The two star rating reflects my emotional reaction to the book rather than any judgement on the writing. "
"513",512,"Sedy .","Comencé pensando que la novela está sobrevalorada. Después de reflexionar, he llegado a la conclusión de que Lolita fue una obra quizá demasiado ""moderna para su época"". Una historia muy original y poco vista, que tuvo sus dificultades para ver la luz (si la pornografía se consideraba vulgar, imaginaos un libro sobre el incesto y la pederastia, en el que el narrador es un maníaco). Por eso, creo yo, es por lo que ahora recibe muchísimas críticas buenas. Y lo entiendo. Y si yo hubiera vivido en esa época estoy segura de que el libro me hubiera escandalizado. Y admiro mucho al autor por su osadía y el granito de arena que ha aportado a la libertad en la palabra escrita. Pero el tema es que soy una chica del siglo XXI. Es por eso que Lolita no me ha gustado.Cuando me comencé a interesar sobre el libro, pensaba que se trataría el tema en profundidad y podría meterme por completo en la mente de Humbert Humbert. Me equivoqué. Además, ese estilo tan sobrecargado y de ""persona culta"" me ha entorpecido mucho el libro (por no mencionar las páginas y páginas innecesarias que hablan sobre lugares, excursiones o de nada en general). Sobre la psicología de los personajes no os ilusionéis, porque sólo vais a conocer al protagonista. Todos los secundarios son meros figurantes que se pueden olvidar con facilidad y, cuando resurgen, es necesario volver atrás en la historia para ver ""quién diablos era ese"".En resumen, Lolita me ha parecido un libro poco estructurado, con un lenguaje muy artificioso (y muchas expresiones francesas intercaladas que no he entendido, puesto que no hablo el idioma) y una trama que va adelante y atrás, y ahora para aquí y para allá. Y es que yo hubiera preferido que fuera un relato. ¿Por qué digo esto? porque un capítulo de la segunda parte me ha parecido el único que merecía la pena de todos los leídos, con un montón de matices y sentimientos y sorpresas. Todos los demás, me han parecido pajilla (no encuentro otra palabra para expresarlo mejor)."

I found the relationship between the two characters to be really weird and most parts of this book put me ill at ease.However if you're looking for something to put you out of your confort zone this might be for you.If you don't know what it's about, the only thing you need to know is that it deals with incest. I did not say rape. Incest. The 13 yrs old Lolita and her relationship with this older man that pretends to be her father in front of the world but really is her lover. Their disturbing, strange, awkward relationship. Kind of a love story in a way. Definitely not for me. Even know, a few years after reading it, when I think about it I don't feel comfortable. At the same time, maybe if I re-read it I would find things that I didn't see the first time."

I know that most people had the same problem, but they got over it after the first part, but i couldn't, it still was really uncomfortable reading it. and it really confuses me when people say that Humbert is the victim here.I didn't like the book, maybe I'm too young to get over Humbert, or maybe it just isn't my cup of tea, all I know is that i'm not revisiting Lolita any time soon."

"550",549,"Jimmy","I have never failed to finish a book that I set out to read. Lolita almost made me question that stance. I felt as though I finished the book more out of spite than enjoyment.I finished readin Lolita for one reason only- because I can. Lolita is a book that made me uncomfortable but I refused to let that stop me. I feel that since there are so many people in the world who would not want me to read this, that I had no choice but to finish it. Lolita is incredibly sexual and when reading from the viewpoint of HH, it can be difficult to remember that the object of his desire is a tween.The prose is beautiful in this novel. It flows and dances but never really leads anywhere. Since Lolita is written from the 1st person perspective of an unreliable narrator, it was perfect but did make for an easy read.I am more happy to have completed this novel than any in recent history.I would recommend that anyone who appreciates good literature, who is also willing to push the limits of his/her own comfort, read this book."
"553",552,"Dave Brown","A difficult book to read. The beauty of Nabokov's mastery of language is a distinct counterpoint to the dark subject matter. One finds oneself caught between disgust at the pedophiliac protagonist, and sorrow for him as he is unwilling to seek change for the condition he attributes to a childhood event. He alternates between an acceptance of damnation for himself, to shamelessly indulging his fantasies, to lamenting and recognizing the shame in his actions in the end. The descriptions can leave one nauseated at times, and I won't even discuss the obvious imagery of the the weapon that isn't used until the end, and then not effectively. The articulate European encounter with post-war America is poignant, but an undercurrent to the primary plot. If you are looking for an example of the writer's craft, I would advise you to consider this book. Otherwise, it would be difficult to recommend. "

"559",558,"Elizabeth Escobar","Wow was this a tough book!Yes, it's a classic just because Nabokov wrote it very, very well: very dark humor --- otherwise, how can you read a book, feeling a little sorry for a pedophile. The plot finally moved the last 1/3 of the book, but the build up-- surprisingly for the times, lots of sex (I guess that's why this book is so famous) -- is interesting. Read this only if you are up to the challenge. Skim, skim, skim through the tough, annoying details. Which are classic for this older writing. Then watch the movie... I was surprised how much they talked about the sex. But of course it doesn't do the book justice... which is why I have a strict law against watching a movie after reading the book!I loved and impresed with James Mason in this role. "
"566",565,"Kristenfalsocapaldi","I have been meaning to read Lolita for some time now, and I have to be honest, I wasn't overly impressed. Besides the ""ick"" factor, which was an initial deterrent, there is just a lot of how do I put this? Down time in the novel. There is a lot of ""we drove here, then we drove here, we bought this, we bought that, we settled here..."" I started to feel like I was reading a travel-log. I don't know what I expected. I didn't find his prose particularly beautiful. I certainly didn't think of it as a love story, as the back cover suggested I should. It picked up in the last stages of the novel, but by then I was just trying to get through it. For the record, I hate having to give so-called classics a luke-warm review, but I just wasn't feeling it. I mean, the first line is killer, and there are some great lines throughout, and Humbert is creepy and obsessive, but overall, not my favorite. "
"568",567,"Walter","Ugg. This book quickly became boring and monotonous. I really liked it up until Hayes was hit by the car. I thought Humbert was an excellent narrator, his thought process was fascinating, and the language and story-telling was enthralling. And then they drove around the country, it became a weird, dark, mystery, and after he lost Lolita I just didn't care at all what happened with the rest of the book. It was a chore to finish."

Excellent narration, really expertly read and this added much to a book I probably would've given up on if I was reading it myself. "
"577",576,"Tang","I have been thinking about what to write. It's not a hard book to read, not at all. On the contrary, i read it pretty easily. I din't like Lolita though. I don't know if i was supposed to dislike Humbert more. I couldn't see him as a villain, never did. Don't get me wrong. Humbert wasn't sane, obviously. He had that obsession with Lolita, but he never tried anything until she came forward. He was loving her in his own way. May i say harmless way? The problem came when they started having a ""relationship"". Neither of them were in their right minds, both being manipulative and false. The end was kind of foreseeable. I gave the book 2 stars, mainly because of the strangeness of the plot."

"588",587,"Filipa","(I guess it goes without saying, but still)TRIGGER WARNING for child abuse/ pedophiliaThis book is soperbly written. The story is approached as a memoir (almost a journal with the amount of extensive and meticulous detail) told through its main character, Humbert Humbert. Nevertheless it's really hard to focus on the book's achievements when it approaches such a strong and sensitive topic that keeps you on the verge of throwing up every other page and hoping the narrator would implode from the first to the last paragraph. All because Humbert (and the other characters as well) are well structured and believable. He (Humbert) meticulously describes his disease - only being able to feel sexually aroused by nymphets - and his particular obsessession with Lolita. The word nymphet, which is thrown around so much through the book, is to me a way of victim blaming in itself. Especially since the narrator is 'aware' of the harm he's done but still seeks his redemption, partially by implying he couldn't help himpself. Despite Nabokov's outstanding job at taking us on a journey into the mind of this conniving professor - with his doubts, fears, and schemes to manipulate and abuse a child without being caught - that's still not enough to make me like this book as a whole, hence the two stars."
"590",589,"Barney","One of those books you read to see what the big deal is. Troubling book though provides incite into unhealthy obsessions. Would not recommend it."

"600",599,"Cheryl Houston","Well, the best thing I can say is it was well written. I wouldn't call it an enjoyable read, but it was strangely compelling."
"603",602,"Emil Fanache","I would rather call it ""The boring travel journal of a pedophile"". I think everyone's looking for an excuse to give it a higher note just because is controversial and is written by Nabokov. I read reviews where people say ""Poor Humbert, you become the witness of his suffering"". How about the girl? She clearly did not love him with that mature level, she was an infant. She was manipulated and scared (see the things he said about her calling the police which would have resulted in her being alone in an institution). She wouldn't have run if it was pleasant for her. Think about the fact she behaved abnormally at school unlike other girls of her age. She was mentally and sexually abused. Since she was the one caught, how come many people call this a love story? However, the subject doesn't make it a bad book. What I hated most was the loooong listing of hotels, motels, descriptions of places. The constant ramble and surplus paragraphs which made me struggle with many pages. The only thing I found enjoyable about this book was the way the writer talked to the reader, the easiness of his constant conversation, making us the jury of his own mental process. Hence the two stars! A huge waste of time!"
"605",604,"Carolina  Proença","Why is this a classic, again? I just think it is plainly nothing. I like Nabokov's writing and subtle descriptions of what could be considered vulgar, but the story is not interesting at all and Humbert's mind and personality are so disturbing and vicious. I don't get why so many people love this book. "

Had she not been 12 (and he hadn't kidnapped her oh and the forcing himself on her and... yeah the list is long) this would have been beautiful.It says something that the Nabokov can make the reader forget that we are traveling with a horribly disgusting individual. I even enjoyed parts of the book.

It also didn't hurt that Jeremy Irons narrated the audiobook version.However, I just don't have the sympathy that others have for the main character, and I cannot view it as a love story no matter how hard I try.

The second half of this book is quite strange and one wonder why Humbert thinks in the manner that he does. B- nevertheless."

While I understand that such censoring was necessary back when this was written, I'm afraid that my modern tastes find it all very disruptive, unappealing. I want to hear the story, not some behind-the-curtain facsimile of it.My suggestion: read the first hundred pages. If you can continue, power to you.

"646",645,"Kyren","Missed out on this one as highschool required reading. Sort of glad, so far I think it would have disturbed me too much as a highschooler...This book has been called a controversial love story. First of all, it is clearly not a love story, the protagonist is a sociopathic pedophile who aside from his lust seems to have no positive feelings toward Lolita at all what so ever. He not only violates her physically but mistreats her throughout the entire book with his unwarranted overbearing ""parenting"" and dishonesty.I think I disliked the central character so much that it made me difficult to enjoy the book. I suppose that could be considered a tribute to Nabokov as a talented writer, but there were definitely parts of the book that were written so stylized and so accurately in Humbert's arrogant prose that it was simply irritating to read.The fact that this story is a memoir by the unreliable narrator leads all of the characters to be imprinted buy his foul personality, there is no relief from Humbert's voice and presence, its unnerving.Nabokov has said, ""I happen to be the kind of author who in starting to work on a book has no other purpose than to get rid of that book,"" and frankly that's how I felt reading it. I wanted to get my hands clean of it but refused to surrender to leaving it incompletely read. I looked forward to finishing it so I could read something else.I gave it two stars. one, for the skill that must be acknowledged in creating a character so detestable and bringing out such negative emotion in the reader. The second star is for chapters 35 and 36 of part 2, the final 2 chapters of the book, which I honestly found to be quite entertaining, and the only ones that, for me contained any of the ""humor"" I had been promised in other reviews."

"669",668,"Chester Dean","De esos libros que pensé me iban a fascinar, pero me pasé toda la lectura forzándome para acabarla porque nunca me atrapó."
"670",669,"Strawberry Fields","I have been deliberating very much on what to say about this book, so I will just express my feelings and observations as they come to me.First of all, I am a lover of ""classic"" books, and this is one I had never read, perhaps out of my own prudish feelings about the subject matter. However, I decided to give it a try to see what all the hype was about and just basically to be able to say, ""Yeah, I read it."". I expected a lot of graphic sex and that was certainly not the case. Most of the sex scenes were more implied than anything else, and what few the reader is given details, it is not explicit at all. There are no curse words to be found anywhere in the book.What captured my attention throughout was trying to figure out Humbert and what drives his obsessions, as most of us must wonder about sexual predators. He justifies his actions vehemently from cover to cover, which in my mind says he knew what he was doing was wrong. One doesn't have to justify what he feels is acceptable. He seems to blame a lot of his behavior on Lolita herself. While she is certainly no angel herself, he as the adult had a responsibility to curtail that. In his weakness he succumbs which in his mind gives him an out on his own personal behavior. All this being said, it is easy to see Humbert as a rational personal who is truly in love. He manages to suck you in at times into believing that he is not such a bad guy, as deplorable as his actions are.What I didn't like about the book was that it was incredibly ""wordy"". Some paragraphs were several pages long. It was easy to get lost in the verbiage although the word play was very captivating. In addition, much of the book was in French with no translations given. I took French in high school roughly 30 years ago (giving away my age!) and I was able to decipher enough to get the general gist of what was being said but not a full accurate translation. I would think that a reader who knows nothing of the language would find this very frustrating.Overall, I feel the book is over-hyped, and was not at all up to my expectations. I wanted to really like it, however I just couldn't muster up any more energy than to rate it a 2. I also feel that the book is overly demonized. As I read I really couldn't find much to be indignant about other than the subject matter itself, child molestation."
"672",671,"Martin Yankov","It turns out Lolita is not my cup of tea. It’s really stylish, beautifully written, but apart from that, there’s nothing I could speak favourably of here. You may think I was too scandalized or disgusted by this novel – the truth is far worse. This book committed a greater crime to me as a reader – it simply bored me.I was intrigued at first. A bit scandalized, I admit, but mostly intrigued. The story started out slowly, but there was some weird tension, something was building up and I got the feeling it would explode in my face. Somehow it never did. After a hundred pages or so that tension just faded away. And then everything became too boring and I actually struggled to finish the novel. The ending was okay, I guess, but nothing exceptionally rewarding or satisfying.I never cared for the main character, not for a second. He was vain, haughty, shallow, he lacked empathy, he considered himself superior to everyone else. He saw other people as weak and pathetic. And he didn’t love – he didn’t truly love anything in this world. I could see why Nabokov once said something like “Why do you think I’m anything like my character? He doesn’t love butterflies.” That character doesn’t have a hobby, he doesn’t have a true passion – apart from his passion for young girls or more precisely their bodies – he doesn’t have friends, he doesn’t admire or respect a single human being. And he never loved Lolita. He had this obsession with her body, later with her persona, but it was always just that – weird obsession. He never actually liked her as a person, he always thought she was irritating. He never wanted to be with her – he wanted to be around her, he wanted to be her master, but nothing more. I can’t identify with that kind of person and maybe that’s why I can’t bring myself to care for that kind of person. And all the other characters, including Lolita, had just minor roles.And let me share one last thing about the writing style of that novel. Yes, the language is gorgeous and all the sentences indeed look wonderful. And yet… when I think about it, when I try to remember a single phrase or a quote that amazed me and stayed with me, I can’t think of anything. And that’s weird, because I always remember quotes and phrases from almost everything I read. So… for all its superficial beauty, the language in this novel couldn’t offer me a single memorable sentence! What a bummer! (This was not my discovery, actually. I discussed this novel in a book-club, and after I praised the writing style on multiple occasions, one person asked me “Okay, tell me a single quote that you remembered, a single sentence or thought that stayed with you”. And I thought of one or two ideas and concepts I enjoyed, but not a single actual sentence or line from the book. And then I truly accepted I was giving this writing way too much credit.)So… if you love this novel and you’re too mad at me for bashing it – please, don’t be. Even the best book can’t win the heart of every reader. "
"673",672,"russell barnes","Hmmm, well I at least finished in time for Book Club - albeit I had to get the last few pages read in the car on the way. It was ""okay"" I suppose. I thought the most interesting bits were his description of their travels around America, given that world has pretty much disappeared. It is a book about love, but Nabokov deliberately muddies the waters with the paedophilia, which ultimately distorts peoples reactions. I could probably have done without the dense, pseudo-stream of consciousness prose as well. Everything just go lost in random French, cod-academia and perving.*Sigh* At least I can tick it off the ""books to read before you die"" list - Wolf Hall next!"

The prose I found dull and schticky when it wasn't outright obnoxious. And well... isn't the prose why this book is so beloved? The caprice of the narration and the circumstantial humor (things like the consideration of drowning) sustained my interest slightly, but the sentiment and bloodshed at the end seemed overwrought, if amusing, afterthoughts.

"690",689,"Andrea Daniels","I had to read this for a college class. Had it not been required, I would have given up on it after about 20 pages.Nabokov's writing, while eloquent, is designed to make the reader feel like an idiot, and he succeeds. He often has the characters randomly speak French, so unless you are bilingual, you will not understand entire paragraphs. He will also throw in characters without introduction, which forces the reader to stop and try to determine who exactly this person is. I found myself wondering often if I had missed something somewhere, but it turned out I had not, Nabokov just likes to mess with your brain.Humbert Humbert, the main character and narrator of the novel, is insane. He points out that he has spent several years in mental hospitals. There are several chapters where you can clearly tell he is descending into madness and paranoia. This makes it harder to determine which events of the novel are actual plot, and which are just hallucinations (think American Psycho, except less funny and more boring)."
"691",690,"Carol Meyer","My edition of Lolita has the following quote from Vanity Fair on the cover ""the only convincing love story of our century."" I guess the 20th century was more cynical than I recall. I would hardly call the story of a mentally ill pedophile, his adolescent prey, and a serious of unsympathetic, mostly revolting supporting characters a love story. The back cover quote from Time--""wildly funny"" is equally strange. Lolita begins with the hunt, and ends with the meaningless murder of an ancillary character. Humbert's relationship with his stepdaughter is sandwiched between two road trips through America each linked by a series of cheap motels. The girl may be a flirt, but she is just a girl. He controls her alternatingly by bribery and threats. An early slow motion chase scene by Humbert's then-wife's French lover in a taxi is later echoed by a phantom convertible tailing Humbert and Lolita on their escapade.Granted, the final bumbling murder scene describes a conflict between two inept middle-aged men and has an element of humor to it (rather like the fight scenes between Mark Darcy and Daniel Cleaver in Helen Fielding's hysterical Bridget Jones books).Finally, though, the book is just sad. Humbert never gets to know anyone, not either of his wives, his post-Lolita companion, or Lolita herself. He is only interested in her body. She finds him boring and repulsive and protects herself with a veneer of disdain. He actively rejects any true human connection. Not funny. Definitely not a love story. "

"694",693,"Kate Woods Walker","To take the heretical view that Lolita, by the ostentatiously-learned and thankfully dead Vladimir Nabokov, is on a par with The Pedophile's Guide to Love and Pleasure, the recently-banished ebook by the hapless molester Philip R. Greaves II, is to place oneself in immediate risk of being labeled a literary Philistine, unable to appreciate the finely-tuned art of the male pedophiliac urge and its containment on a page. But I take such a view, happily.Of course Lolita is a well-written book. It is fourth on the Modern Library list of the 20th Century's greatest literary works, after all. But its placement at such a lofty height is more a testament to the power of patriarchal framing—where men have the right to satisfy their every urge and females and children are property—than its actual literary merit. Ultimately, however, it has no more artistic merit than Greaves's ""how-to"" because it is merely a fancy ""I-did.""It's a well-constructed lie within a lie within a lie within a lie. It's a sick joke. It's a pedophile's self-referential love story about himself, to himself. It's fantastically realistic because it is fantastically real. Any real-life Dolores or Charlotte can tell you so. As The Socially Skilled Child Molester by Carla van Dam can show you, there are no better liars on the face of the earth than child molesters, and there is no greater thrill for them than to get away with it. Imagine the Humbertian ego-gasm that resulted from committing a crime, dressing up the crime as art, publicly confessing the crime, returning to the theme of the crime over and over again, and having the crime judged one of the century's greatest acts.The reluctance by the literary world to see the crime—to instead howl about art vs. reality, writer vs. character, fact vs. fiction—is perhaps the writer’s biggest triumph. Oh, we can see and appreciate that John Irving has personal daddy issues, as we follow him from circus to circus. We can follow the theme of middle class families upended by violent crime in the works of Joyce Carol Oates. We can wrestle with Anne Rice’s personal religious quest. But Nabokov and pedophilia? Heaven forefend! The critical world has become the mother who does not see her husband’s hand up the daughter’s skirt, but sees instead the beautiful tailoring of the skirt and sleeve.And ultimately, despite its sledgehammer of erudition and its sheen of pretended allegory, Lolita fails as art because it becomes heavy with its own evil, banal and boring. Nabokov, with easy and familiar comparisons to regular pornography in his afterword, enumerates the many ways Lolita departs from and surpasses everyday porn. But it doesn’t. It merely dresses it up. And to this reader, that is an aggravating factor rather than a mitigating one."

Sometimes I'm amazed I finished it. The premise is so disturbing, the character's thoughts and actions so rash and detestable...I suppose I hoped the author would turn the man to repentence by the end of the book, that the entire reason for writing it was to highlight redemption. That Lolita is considered a classic is disturbing to me, content-wise. Is Nabokov a genius or simply mad?"

Part of me just wanted to get through it, and felt compelled to keep going, even though some of it was so disturbing, I wanted to stop reading. It was compelling, if just to find out what happened. But, in my rush to get through it, it seemed like I missed some details that left me a bit confused at the end. Not really sure how I feel about it.

Lolita falls ill and is left in hospital to recover (reluctantly by her abuser) where she disappears.Humbert searches for years, eventually finding her pregnant, married and poor - yet not by her kidnapper, Quilty, whom is mentioned the book throughout - Quilty left her well before as she refused to do porn with him and his friends...... Humbert begs her to return to him but she refuses, so he leaves her money and departs, determined to track down Quilty. When found, Humbert shoots Quilty, killing him. Humbert is arrested and put in jail, where he continues to write his memoir, stipulating that it can only be published upon Lolita’s death.

For one thing, I was repulsed by the fact that I felt a sort of sympathy for Humbert, as I might feel toward anyone with a degenerative disease. Toward the end of the story, that sympathy evaporated and I felt nothing but disgust and pity for his obsession. I felt both pity and judgment toward Lolita for being something more complicated than a victim. I admire Nabokov's ability to write about such a twisted subject without using perverse vocabulary as well -- I felt the story was masterfully told, and were it not for a few one-line zingers that clearly and succinctly laid bare the circumstances in which the two main characters lived their lives, I might have finished the book without ever feeling nauseous."

Reading about a pedophile who's justifying why he's that way, and the relationship he has with a 12 year old is disturbing. But, perhaps the most disturbing part is the quote on the front of my book: ""The only true love story of our time."" I wholeheartedly disagree. This isn't a love story, it's a story of a sick man who only wants to be in relationships with adolescent girls. I can see how this novel became so famous-the controversial topic, his literary style, and the shock factor of reading a book from the perspective of a pedophile.

"839",838,"Mel","Blegh. That's what I think of this story. And it was not necessarily the subject matter that makes me say that. This book was a long-winded lyrical story. I applaud Nabokov for his flowery writing and impressive vernacular usage. Some words I had even forgotten were in the English language. No, it was simply far too slow moving for me to be very entertained. Nonetheless, I did it, I read the whole damn thing."

"845",844,"Ruby","While I know that this book is a well-loved classic, I found it really difficult to get into and almost impossible to understand n some places. Maybe this was Nabokov's writing style, but more likely it was that I was simply not in the right frame of mind to read this. Overall, I was kind of disappointed though.I did only give it two stars, but I do recommend giving it a go nonetheless - I'm definitely going to give it a reread in a few years."
"846",845,"Sophie Mitchell","This book left me feeling in need of something more. At times it was a book I couldn't put down, but at other times I had trouble turning the page. Nabokov's style of writing was new and interesting to me, but didn't evoke the same emotions as other styles of writing which help you connect with the character. What I thought this book was lacking was character development. I was missing that simpathy and relatability that makes me want to cry or laugh or scream. I wanted the book to make me feel something, anything but it just made me want to finish quickly and move on to the next book on my forever growing list. Also the book was very very detailed to a point where I couldn't handle it any longer. If you are looking for a book that will give you an insight into the mind of a aging man's love for young girls, I wouldn't say this is the book for you because although it provides insight, I found the relationship hard to believe. Mainly because I found Lolita's character so unbelievable. But with that, I would still recommend the book. It is a classic and a classic for a reason so give it a try!"

But the other characters weren't interesting as well.He is so found of Lolita/Dolores like a mad man.

"865",864,"Alicia Beale","When I was in high school, every morning my homeroom was in the early childcare class and my teacher was fairly conservative but in a fox news Oprah kind of way. She made oatmeal for us and offered motherly advice on our teenage crisis. One day, she asked us about the movie ""American Beauty"". She wanted to know which of us laughed at the movie because if we laughed and didn't like it then it showed how our morals reacted defensively against the immorality displayed in the film. This idea has stayed with me through life and I think about it as I now write about ""Lolita"".I cringed while reading ""Lolita"", possibly because I am too immoral for the morality within the book. My generation and those coming after me have been exposed to sex and sexual deviation explicitly. We can say very blunt sexual terms freely and out loud. We have watched and giggled at sexual predators who are caught on reality tv shows. The voice that Nabokov gave to Humbert Humbert felt cheesy and made Humbert seem like a doofus who of course would go on the internet and eventually get caught by Chris Hansen on television. Vladmir Nabokov would have been repulsed by ""To Catch A Predator"" and most likely would have much more cutting things to criticize modern culture about than Jonathan Franzen, but this is the world that we live in now. Phrases such as ""fire of my loins"" and ""scpetre of my passion"" read more like bad Nora Roberts in the society where ""50 Shades of Gray"" was sold in supermarket check-out counters. "
"867",866,"Andrée","A horrid tale of one man's desire for a twelve-year-old girl. Nabokov writes from Humbert Humbert's perspective, encouraging the reader to delve into the inner-workings of this sick and twisted mind, as it goes to any lengths and measures to win the affections of Lolita. I will break this book into three parts - the first, a compelling read, in a morbid sort of way. The reader is drawn into the sick world in an effort to watch how the events unfold, that Humbert may win his Lolita's heart. It was really quite shocking how fluidly the events unfolded, practically thrusting Lolita into his lap in a neat little package equipped with a gift bow. Much too easy, much too unbelievable; especially that it would be Lolita who seduced Humbert, and not Humbert that necessarily violated her without her consent. The second part really lost me completely. I felt bogged down and uninterested by their life on the road, and even moreso by Humbert's incessant worrying that Lolita might be playing him for a fool, and that he may lose her (which he does). Page after page after page described their travel adventures, and Lolita's fluctuating moods. It became all too tiresome and, at one point, I put the book down for several days before deciding to give it another go. The third part picked up slightly, once Lolita had escaped Humbert's clutches. Though, the ending was an anti-climax. There wasn't much character development for Quilty, the man who 'kidnapped' Lolita from Humbert, so the 'betrayal' didn't hit home with the reader as much as it could have or should have. One may have felt that it would have been better for Humbert to exact his revenge upon himself. However, that Lolita had found love in her own way, and was living a better life than had been offered to her by Humbert was a comfort. Especially that Humbert granted her no grudge for having left him, and even provided for her and her husband, and the baby that was on its way. It doesn't necessarily make up for what he inflicted upon her, but it allows the reader to let go of the ordeal and try to move on.Despite the lurid events which took place within the novel, the driving force behind my own compulsion to continue reading the book was Nabokov's prose. The book was brilliantly written, and should be admired for that if anything else. "
"870",869,"Ali Adenwala","If it weren't for the amazing writing style and the beginning, this book was have gotten one star.The beginning (the first 60-70 pages or so) was great, but somewhere along the way it got increasingly boring and repetitive, and for a long time nothing was really happening. There were  too  many descriptions (or completely irrevevant things) which, if cut down a bit, would have made the book a lot easier to read. Granted, all of these descriptions were very well written, but a pain in the ass to read over and over again, when all we want is the story to progress.And the rest is rust and stardust. "
"872",871,"Shaimaa Ali","When I started reading ""Lolita"" I had a general idea what it was about, but kinda wanted to read the original work. Through fear & disgust I dived into this novel details..A very young HH in a love story, inspired by the legendary poem ""Annabel Lee"" - by Edgar Alan Poe, then losing his childhood's love and what a dreadful person he turned to be .. It was many and many a year ago,    In a kingdom by the sea, That a maiden there lived whom you may know    By the name of Annabel Lee; And this maiden she lived with no other thought    Than to love and be loved by me. The similarities - even in vocabulary - were so close, that I kept asking myself : but you didn't read Poe fully?!I was a child and she was a child,    In this kingdom by the sea, Both were young lovers, no love was enforced between them, no Rape!! I disliked the characters, all of them actually .. Even Nabokov logic itself, later on his commentary on the novel he was asked many times by the critics & readers alike why he wrote such a novel, basically, I was not convinced .. Defending it that no erotic scenes were there made it even worse cos he left all the savage details to your imagination! However, one can not deny Nabokov's genius ability to illustrate internal emotions of his main character .. HH defended his choice (loving a nymphet) by those lines: "" Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the majority of sex offenders that hanker for some throbbing, sweet-moaning, physical but not necessary coital, relation with a girl-child, are innocuous, inadequate, passive, timid strangers who merely ask the community to allow them to pursue their practically harmless, so-called aberrant behavior, their little hot wet private acts of sexual deviation without the police and society cracking down upon them. We are not sex fiends! We do not rape as good soldiers do. We are unhappy, mild, dog-eyed gentlemen, sufficiently well integrated to control our urge in the presence of adults, but ready to give years and years of life for one chance to touch a nymphet. Emphatically, no killers are we. Poets never kill.""I read this novel because it is one of English literature masterpieces, knowing that I won't like it. However, I didn't even like the writing style as it kept changing between English & French (with no translation) .. As if the writer is punishing us cos he didn't write in Russian ( he destroyed the original novella earlier & re-write this one). I won't talk about the Arabic translation cos a ""DISASTER"" would be an underestimation .. It was narrated, not translated with all the details stripped off .. "

But then, had he shifted the sylLABles to the correct ""naBOKov,"" he would have destroyed the meter, and as we know Gordon likes his meter. Still, I have forever pronounced the author's name incorrectly because of it.It took me two weeks to get through this novel. Part of it was the initial horror of the subject matter (""am I really reading this?""). Then, there's the writing itself. NaBOKov's controversial work is, above all else, a jungle of literary tricks. Realizing this (or being advised as such), I switched to the Annotated edition when I reached Part II. Doing so consolidated that which I had been Googling anyway: definitions, translations, parodies. There's the obvious, the ""Lo and Behold"" jokes (""Lo"" = ""Lola""), and there's the arcane (James Joyce, James Joyce, James Joyce). When you see the full range of riddles and references enumerated as they are in the Annotated Lolita, you appreciated the depth of NaBOKov's writing. ""Lolita"" is not for the casual reader. It proved a tremendous challenge for someone like me--not a literary scholar.

"
"902",901,"Emily Crowe","Warning: Spoilers abound. From the little I knew about Lolita before I picked it up, it was not really a book I ever wanted to read. But while I'm not above judging a book by its cover, I decided that I shouldn't judge Lolita without at least dipping into it first. Many people I know love this book. Writer friends and acquaintances frequently include it on their Top Ten lists. Plus I've been saying to myself that I need to start reading a little Russian literature. How can one be well-read without reading any of the Russians? One day while changing the sheets in our guest bedroom I noticed the Vintage paperback edition of Lolita on the shelf and said to myself, What the hell? It helped that this one was only 300 pages long. I started the book that night and had to force myself several times throughout to finish it. My husband kept teasing me about it: ""you must really love that book, the way you're tearing through it."" But he couldn't be more wrong. I was appalled, almost from start to finish. What I found inside these pages was actually far worse than what I had imagined.If, as many people claim, the intention of literature is to disturb, then by golly, this book is literature. But that's a load of codswallop, in my opinion. I think great literature can be disturbing, but for me, the point of reading is to create empathy. And it's not that I turn away from disturbing fiction. I have long admired works by Toni Morrison (The Bluest Eye and Beloved), Cormac McCarthy (all of 'em) and D. M Thomas (The White Hotel), and they're nothing if not disturbing. But they're also full of humanity, depth, spirit, and redemption--none of which Lolita had for me. Lolita started off well enough, dubious confession from the narrator aside. Humbert Humbert falls in love with a girl at the seaside and has his first sexual encounter with her. Fine. Annabel is ""a few months my junior,"" as Humbert recounts. Annabel's premature death results in what can only be called arrested development, because thereafter Humbert is only sexually attracted to young girls. So far, it's about what I expected. But then Humbert receives a peculiar inheritance that stipulates he must live in America to benefit, and shortly thereafter the bile rose in my throat on a regular basis. He only boards with Mrs. Haze after seeing her 12 year old daughter sunbathing in the backyard. From there he keeps a diary of his lustful thoughts about Dolores, whom he calls Lolita. She, in turn, has a crush on handsome Humbert. One day when they're alone he pulls her onto his lap and masturbates against her. But it's when he fantasizes about a sleeping pill strong enough that he could rape Lolita without waking either her or her mother that I grew most disgusted. He goes so far as to experiment with different strengths of pills and is disappointed that they don't seem to work.Ugh--fast forward through Humbert's marriage to Mrs. Haze and her subsequent death. He is now Lolita's sole guardian, and after that point he molests the girl on a daily basis and threatens her with dark tales of deprivation and group foster care to hold her silence. And yet Humbert persistently sees himself as the victim in their scenario: ""There is nothing more atrociously cruel than an adored child."" Yeah, poor guy. Long story short: they take a year-long road trip, staying in a different motel each night so that nobody will suspect Humbert of raping his step daughter. And so that Lolita will not know anybody well enough to confide what is happening to her. Eventually they settle down and she goes to an all-girls boarding school. When she wants to go out with her girlfriends, Humbert requires extra sexual favors from him and he gets upset that she performs desultorily. Huh. Go figure. Then she's in a play after which he abducts her and they go on another long road trip. One night Lolita gets so sick she must be hospitalized and Humbert, in his usual martyred voice says, ""giving up all hope of intercourse, I wrapped her in a laprobe."" Helluva guy, that Humbert.Lolita is then abducted/rescued from the hospital by a man claiming to be her uncle. Humbert then spends the rest of his inheritance criss-crossing the US trying to find them. He doesn't. But one day he gets a note from Lolita asking for money--she's pregnant and she needs money to move to Alaska. Humbert shows up, with murderous thoughts, and only gives up the money in exchange for the name of the person who liberated her, whom he tracks down and kills, for which crime he narrates this tale from prison, stipulating that it not be published 'til after his death. The end.So, what I want to know is how this book has become such a milestone of American letters, so canonized, so revered? The cover of the book proclaims, ""The only convincing love story of our century (Vanity Fair)."" Um, did they read the same book I did? This is a novel dedicated to the abomination of love. I wonder if the same reviewer would call Mein Kampf ""the only convincing political tract of our time.""Nabokov is frequently regarded as ""one of the twentieth century's master prose stylists"" (from the back cover), and there were times when I thought the writing was quite good. And of course the fact that he is so facile with a language beyond his native tongue is a remarkable feat and praiseworthy all on its own. But there are also long passages where the text meanders so much that it's hard to tell up from down. Here's one such example, where Humbert is describing nymphets, the word he coins to describe those girls on the cusp of reaching sexual maturity, to whom he exclusively attracted: ""Neither are good looks a criterion; and vulgarity, or at least what a given community terms so, does not necessarily impair certain mysterious characteristics, the fey grace, the elusive, shifty, soul-shattering, insidious charm that separates the nymphet from such coevals of hers as are incomparably more dependent on the spatial world of synchronous phenomena than on that intangible island of entranced time where Lolita plays with her likes.""For this reader, at least, the prose does not elevate the subject to the point of literature, and I confess it bothers me still, three weeks after completing this novel, that the sexual abuse and coercion of children is somehow legitimized by this book's canon status. It's not that books like this are published--I believe in the free market and publishing works uncensored. It's the fact that important writers, even feminist writers, elevate the pedestal this book stands on that bothers me. If it were instead a cult classic, maybe something along the lines of Bret Easton Elli's American Psycho, another book that I know would disturb me and thus will never read, I could rest more easily. I know that many of my blog's followers must have read this book. I'd love you to engage me a dialogue about Lolita with your thoughts on the subject, as I feel fairly sure I hold a minority view on this novel."
"903",902,"Roger Angle","Boring. I don't get what all the hoopla has been about, all these years. When Humbert finally gets around to seducing the girl, she takes over and wants him, of all things. So it is almost like he isn't committing a crime, which lets the air out of the story. Then there is the world's longest most boring travelogue. Snore. "
"904",903,"Dana Davis","This book was definitely well written, however I thought it was pretty boring. I guess I'm just not interested in an older man's sexual feelings for a child."
"905",904,"Laila","I tried.I gave it 50-ish pages, which is my rule if I'm not feeling a book. I can see why critics revere this novel - the writing is excellent. But the subject matter is creepy at best and revolting at worst. Couldn't make myself do it."
"909",908,"Alee","Dark and disturbing, but like a train wreck you can't help but look at. I thought the prose was too poetic and bombastic, would have been 4-5 stars if a good editor made it easy to read and follow."
"914",913,"Nadinastiti","Two things I realized when finishing Lolita for the second time yesterday: first, I was really really really innocent the first time I read this book. Second, you will never really hate someone if you had read their thoughts and views (remind me of Atticus Finch's quote!) The story? Well, it's about Humbert Humbert, a man who sees Annabel, his very first love, in Dolores Haze, a nymphet. I agree with those who say that Lolita is ""a story about the exploitation of a weak adult by a corrupt child, and not the corruption of an innocent child by a cunning adult"". Maybe because Nabokov told the story first-person, and he never give us any of Dolores/Lolita's view. We'll never know how sweet Lolita was, but you will hate the Lolita character instantly.So, now I understand the whole story. I can't say I liked it, but I will say that it gives me an unusual experience. Mixed language (with french); how Humbert Humbert always change to Humbird, Humburg, and else; the Humbert-wrote-it-while-waiting-for-the-execution format; and many more.After all, it's a classic. You should read it for the sake of experience."
"916",915,"Felicia","The writing wasn't something I was used to, it was odd to me. I don't know any French so that did not help.The book just wasn't for me, I don't see the appeal. It's hard to put into words how I feel about it."

I'm sure i'll go back and finish it someday but it's not a high priority."

I believe that I am fairly well-educated, and my vocabulary is definitely above average. But the words used by Nabokov were absolutely ridiculous. Every few pages had me rifling through the dictionary. This really disrupted the flow of reading, and made the experience quite unenjoyable.Furthermore, there is not much to the story. Assuming that one is able to gloss over the excessive use of unnecessarily erudite words, the story is not anywhere near as great as others claim. It isn't a bad story, but it is certainly unworthy of the high praise it receives.In summary:1. The large words detract from the story and come off as pretentious. 2. The story itself is mediocre at best.3. This book is HIGHLY overrated."

"959",958,"Wonhee Park","I always wondered what it feels like to read a book where I cannot relate to the narrator at all. Now I know. And it's not a great feeling. There are glimmers of humor in this dark, depressing book and even in those parts, I wondered if it was okay to laugh or if that little laughter might damn me. I read the book mostly because I was curious as to why the book was so controversial. And that curiosity has been satisfied. "

"966",965,"James Maxey","I can understand why a lot of people think highly of this book, since the writing is very evocative and there's a certain courage required of an author to delve this deeply into the psyche of such and unsympathetic main character. I admired the book up to the point where Lolita herself is introduced. Then, the book suffered from some really hard to swallow lucky breaks that were necessary to take the plot to where Nabokov wanted it to go. First, it's not Humbert's idea to marry Lolita's mother in order to get closer to the girl, the mother instead throws herself at him and insists on marriage. Then, when the mother learns that Humbert is a pedophile, she runs across the street to mail a letter exposing him and is immediately run over by a car and killed. Then, when he goes to pick up Lolita with the scheme of kidnapping her and seducing her, she turns out to already be sexually active and makes the first move to seduce him (though this could be spin on the part of an unreliable narrator). One or two lucky breaks for the protagonist are acceptable, but several back to back started to make it feel like Nabokov was just eager to get to the creepiest parts of the book and was taking plot short cuts to get there. Then, at the point where the tension of the book should be the highest, the book turns into a travelogue, with long lists and short descriptions of all the places they visit and stay as they move around the country. It's like sitting through someone's vacation slideshow. Again, I think that, plucking out any given passage from the book, I'd have to admit that it's powerful writing. It was just as a whole that it fell apart for me. "
"967",966,"Dolly","Having finished this book, I understand why people have such conflicting views on it. It is a twisted narrative, albeit beautifully written, that sucks you in. At the same time, it involves a very disturbing subject matter. I would disagree with criticism that at any point the reader is invited to really sympathise with the main character: he is in no way a protagonist. Never do you forget that he's a disgusting, selfish, cowardly, predator. But his story, or perhaps, his obsessive delusion, is consuming in it's inevitable implosion. Nabakov's skill as a writer is immense; at many points I wanted to stop reading, because Humbert is a horrifying creep. But the way Nabakov writes never validates Humbert, and the story is, despite its dark subject matter, fascinating. The denouement of the novel is especially tense and gripping. It's a vivid story about a dark, destructive, obsessive character.(Trigger warnings for child abuse, pedophilia, emotional abuse.)"
"968",967,"Reader","I bought this book after I read some reviews on this website. It had so many 4-5*s I thought it was going to blow me away!It was horrible. One thing I hate: novels that are choc-filled with irrelevant bla-bla-bla-ing to fill up the book.The author is clearly very talented, and extremely intellectual which is constantly shown off with the use of 'big words' and references to things/people/events that you cant be sure are made up or not.There were some parts of this which made me laugh out loud. Once again, a very talented writer, but sadly by about two thirds in I was skipping pages. It was so utterly boring, confusing, and shallow. I felt no depth of the characters at all. Take out all the irrelevant rubbish and it might have been a 3* story. "
"970",969,"Vivi Vocat","It is a great achievement to write from the perspective of the villain and still be able to capture and fascinate readers all over the world. You‘ll never like Humbert, but you still keep on reading. It is even more so a great feat, because the characters in the book remain two-dimensional.The language, full of word plays and wit, is so rich and beautiful that it made me reread certain passages several times. But even the use of very beautiful language and powerful images couldn’t mask the fact that this is a book about a pedophile, kidnapping and raping his victim several times. This is not a love story or a game; it’s a trip into the mind of child molester. Personally, I fail to understand, why so many try to attribute a deeper meaning to it. There is none, for the book is meant to unsettle and provoke the reader. It is meant to take you to a dark place and depict raw unchecked and primal desires of man’s nature, in which some might recognize your own base instincts masked by civility and morality, thus scaring you with the underlying truth: How society loves to blame the victim and how willingly and readily many will follow Humbert’s reasoning.I didn’t like this book, because it is so deviant and took me to places so dark, perverted and unfortunately true.

Yet other times I was compelled to read and thought the book was written and set up beautifully. So as an unfolding events it was done beautifully, with beautiful language. However the premise and the ""love story"" was vile. The last chapter was the best, Humbert finally gets what he deserves, but the last 60 pages or so I just couldn't wait to get the book over with. Every time I read the words, ""nympet or pubescent"" after page 50 I nearly gagged! There are just some things that one shouldn't read I suppose."

"987",986,"Emusam","Let me be clear: my rating isn't based on my disapproval of pedophilia. I really was just annoyed by Humbert and Lolita. I couldn't stand either of them. Humbert's narration almost never stopped annoying me. Perhaps I was tired of it because the narrator of Pale Fire's commentary section was done in a similar way (European transplant with inflated self-image and elevated speech) and it is still fresh in my mind. In any case, H.H. grated on my nerves. My favorite part of the book was when Dolores left Humbert. The end bit where he shoots Cue was also quite strange, and was probably my favorite section. Reading Nabokov's explanatory section after the end was very interesting--that it was perhaps something like a love letter to the English language, which he had embraced after being forced by circumstance to leave publishing in Russian.

"990",989,"Grillo","The prose itself is beautiful and pretty much unmatched, but as a whole...it's not for me. I found the actual story something of a trudge, and thought that in terms of plot, it pretty much unraveled during the second half. In addition, I found the single-minded fixation of H.H. numbing, and his personality absolutely abhorrent, which I think is the point, but it makes for unsatisfying reading. It might be okay if there was something new and vital being imparted as the novel progressed, some interesting continued psychological development, but after the first fifty pages, you really know all you need to know."
"993",992,"Bruce Henderson","This was not a very enjoyable book. I decided to read more works considered ""fine literature"" and this book would lead to another. However, with Lolita, you spend the vast majority of the time (on the order of about 95 percent or so) in Humbert Humbert's head where he takes you on his trip to dementia. I'm impressed that Nabokov was able to do that, but it was not a fun trip.In addition, the author consistently made HH use French words, clauses, phrases and even entire paragraphs to illustrate how he considered himself an intellectual in the face of his obsession. As Dolores (HH's Lolita) put it, ""But do you mind very much cutting out the French? It annoys everybody."" Indeed it does.So much for HH's propensity to annoy. Nabokov manages to annoy me as well. I appreciate learning new words from books as much as the next person, but never have I read a book with so many new words. My vocabulary is not particularly small, but I usually go through a novel and glean perhaps 5 or 6 new words. Nabokov's Lolita gave me over 60: backfisch, derlickwent, lentor, antemeridian, pharisaic, Laodicean, trochaic, lanugo, anent (twice), pavonine, oculate, leporine, fain, purly (and purling), viatic, buncombe, inly, poltroon, favonian, nates, incarnadine, acrosonic, alembic (and alembics), tombal, crepitated, apotheosis, coeval, uranist, manque (accent over the ""e""), fascinum, girleen, voluptas, grues, jocosely, phocine, dolors, charshaf, seraglio, saporous, duenna, philter (several times), olisbos, lentigo, cretonne, orchideous, tesselated, caloricity, venus febriculosa, kurort (kurortish), remises, wimble, syncope, execrabic, ancilla, undinist, gitanilla, fatamorganas, turpid, penele, selenian, logomancy, logodaedaly, ensellure, and undoubtedly more. I don't need this many new words in what is a relatively short book. In context, it is surprisingly easy to imagine other words that could have been used but for some reason, it was decided to wow the audience. I fail to appreciate it."
"997",996,"Mydul Islam","A fantastic adult novel."
"998",997,"Deska","Controversial and Disturbing! Reading this left me with a dreadful feeling, thou I must admit that Nabokov surpassed beyond the imaginary of fiction with this book.. I might not like it, but hey it's masterpiece and superb in its own way"
"1001",1000,"Efrén Ayón","The for many years considered as quintessential experience for readers all across the world could not match its potential.And how could it? It's as whimsical and lyrcal as it is boring and excesive. Nabokov's prose it's relentless, beautiful, classical and, why not, more european than american. But there is nothing else here, just talent. This novel contains a handful of passages that'll charm their way to the deepest of what some call soul, but otherwise it's a book about the ramble on of a man desesperate to make you notice him by the gift he has born with.And there it is, an unpopular opinion of the great not-so-american novel."

I usually prefer it that way-to let a book take me by surprise. And this is exactly what Lolita did.May i also mention here that I had no idea what the word Lolita meant, by and by.Well, it doesn't take you long before you realize what the storyline is. I haven't really discussed it with many people since it's a recent read but I hope to God I don't find any supporters for the narrator.It's grasping, I'll give it that. No matter how disgusted your insides feel, you have an inclination to read on.A literary genius, no doubt, but it did not appeal to me. The two-stars i gave this book is for the beautiful manipulation of writing; which is the only thing that pacifies the grotesque nature of the story.On a note of honesty, this book scared me. "

"1021",1020,"Portia S","Suffice to say, I did not enjoy this book. One thing I have to agree always with Murakami is when he said in Norwegian Wood, *If you read what everyone else is reading, you're going to think like everyone else* Paraphrasing, but yes. I read this because it's on a BBC list of ""100 Must Read"", etc etc, and none of these included any works by Somerset Maugham I MUST add.The saving grace of this books was it's prose, so beautifully written, however, like the lauded Wilde, this writer would go off on a tangent that added nothing to the plot or excited my interest. Writing is like taking a walk, Dahl once said, you start with leaving the house, going up towards the hill top, sometimes you take the part well traveled and other times the rougher road. *Pardon the dialect* This man take all kinda back road and short street and had me there waiting waiting waiting, and I was just there, like what this hadda do with anything? The best parts of this book was the beginning and the end. Though I didn't like it terribly, it's saving grace had to have been the end, that was pretty good, quite intense and I really was like a thirsty man being dosed with cold water then. So yeah, those are my thoughts. "

Kuid süüdistada last manipuleerimises on sama, kui süüdistada kassipoega mänguhimulisuses. Täiskasvanu, suurema intelligentsiga isik, on ikka see, kes määrab, kust lähevad piirid.

"1026",1025,"Marcy","I started this but never finished it. Really wanted to read it. Kind of slow...which is why I didn't finish it. Plan to pick it up again. Interesting story line."
"1027",1026,"Moody","At the end of my copy of Lolita, Nabakov refers to the novel as the record of his love affair with the English language. He goes on to address a variety of criticisms, among them that the work doesn’t teach one anything. He explains that he is not a writer of didactic fiction and reveals his purpose for starting a book is to get rid of that book, and to achieve a kind of aesthetic bliss. That's fair enough.Awake one night on a friend's couch, I picked up Lolita to read myself to sleep. I flipped to the center, read a few spicy pages, and dozed off. The book came home with me, and I approached it with an open mind, all preconceptions aside. (Who would have believed I would discover my first literary reference to the iliac crests? Thanks Nabakov...though a little unsettling.)This story is Humbert's Confession, and in that way, Nabakov excuses the descriptive flourishes and singular focus of his protagonist. I signed on for the first forty pages, his background and meeting Lolita, but suffered the next two hundred with much less enthusiasm. For the bulk of the latter, I was nauseated and bored.Nothing about Humbert's telling feels contrived, and the writing retains its authenticity throughout. That demonstration of craft, together with the particularly sharp writing of the final eight chapters (some fantastic bits), made Lolita worth the read; however, I don't feel it provided any important perspective for me to consider, and I wouldn't ever reread it.However I cannot deny the novel’s impact – for weeks afterwards, Humbert’s sad, trick logic would pollute my thoughts. And I delighted in the tennis passage, along with his treat scatological conquests. But throughout it all, I kept thinking, “When is he going to set the page on fire?” He never did.On the back cover of my copy, it reads, ""The only convincing love story of our century."" (Vanity Fair). This is a testament, I suspect, to Nabakov's skill in channeling Humbert's ugly, lunatic voice. And I get why it’s good. Furthermore, I take interest and admire when an author successfully inhabits the mind of his character. But, I liken the experience to watching an exquisite performance in a bad film. Just because I appreciate the art of the craft doesn’t mean the story resonates. I didn't abandon the thing, but I'm glad it's over.(A Reluctant Note: A few years ago my job required a careful reading of certain police reports, including the statements and elocutions from criminals detailing every aspect of their offenses. This experience drained all the blood from the story of Lotlita, for me.)"
"1028",1027,"Adam Rodgers","This was painful to read, although I finished it to the end, hoping to see something I was missing. I may not be intelligent enough to get out of this what others see as a masterpiece, but to me most of it was repulsive. Just not my kind of book. In most books with criminals as the main character at least the books manage to help me sympathize somewhat with the criminal, like in Stephen King's Secret Window, Secret Garden. But in this book any chance of my sympathy or even interest was lost right at the beginning, and it was hard to get past that. I just kept hoping he would get caught as soon as possible. In other words the book is written in a very descriptive way with beautiful, poetic words, but not enough to make me appreciate them because of what he was constantly describing and lusting after. "
"1033",1032,"Mogbolahan Koya-Oyagbola","Undoubtedly a well written book but the disturbing subject matter kept interfering with me moving forward. I've never watched a snuff movie and I don't know that I ever would even if one such movie were gaining rave reviews as a cinematic masterpiece. While written fiction (however disturbing the subject matter) can never be placed in the same category as snuff movies, it can be equally disturbing on the psyche.For the reasons above I'm not sure I'll ever be able to read this book from start to finish."

I slogged through it, it took forever, but I am glad it's done, it was worth the read, in hindsight."
"1049",1048,"Joseph","I admittedly went into reading this book with high expectations. It is a classic and is erotic, which is a departure from my familiar finance reading.

"1052",1051,"Miri","I almost don't want to try and sort out exactly how I feel about this book, because I don't want to give it that degree of attention now that I've finished. If the book is hard for me to process, the reviews of it are maybe even worse. Yes, of course, the prose is elegant. Yes, the perspective is unique and sickeningly... well, interesting, for lack of a better word. No, I do not understand why people call it a love story. I am truly baffled by how many times I've seen the word ""tender"" used to describe it. I think I'd give it one star for my opinion of it, so I'll give it an extra star for the skill in writing.Have I ever read a character as self-indulgent and self-pitying as Humbert Humbert? Poor Humbert, poor meek, abject, massive, pathetic, desperate clawed Humbert, simultaneously a monster and a hero in his own mind, turned on by the ankles and skin and ""stippled armpit"" of a twelve-year-old girl who picks her nose while he makes her sit on his naked erection. He fantasizes about having sex with his own future daughter and granddaughter, congratulating himself on how ""tender"" he is, how great a ""father,"" how miserable and courageous. He craves Lolita, but that is not the same as love. He hurts her, physically and emotionally, routinely and deliberately. That is not tenderness. It's abuse.He may even actually love her—how would I know?—but that does not make this story a story about love. It is the story of an intensely troubled adult man who rapes his twelve-year-old stepdaughter, taking her hostage around the entire country, lying in bed listening to her cry as soon as he feigns sleep every night for two years. It's the story of obsession and total self-absorption. Frankly, looking at the real-world reception of the book, I think it's the story of everything and everyone that is casually sacrificed to the ""art"" of the ""White Widowed Male."" Because as it says in the pseudonymous foreword of the book, actually just part of the book, written by Nabokov as John Ray, Jr.:""The learned may . . . [assert] that 'H.H.'s impassioned confession is a tempest in a test tube; that at least 12 percent of American males—a 'conservative' estimate according to Dr. Blanche Schwarzman (verbal communication)—enjoy yearly, in one way or another, the special experience 'H.H.' describes with such despair; that had our demented diarist gone, in the fatal summer of 1947, to a competent psychopathologist, there would have been no disaster; but then, neither would there have been this book."" Equal tragedies, apparently. Because what's the life of a girl compared to Art?"
"1053",1052,"Lisa Mills","Humbert Humbert needed to keep his inappropriate relationship with Lolita secret but he soon became supremely obsessive and controlling over her. He ranted on and on and his dialogue became confusing to me. I guess his madness was so complete that I couldn’t keep up and I feel like I missed out on a lot of what really happened."

"1055",1054,"Laraine","NOTE: I read this book for a book club discussion; I opted out of the actual discussion as did several other members.This was my second read of this novel--the first being a few decades ago. I recall the movie starring James Mason but it's the haunting music I remember more than the actual script or acting--perhaps its because of the movie's theme.I heard this book was originally intended to be a comedy, which I find hard to believe. I can't even say it's really the love story it's advertised to be, except I am sure for Humbert Humbert, truly ""madly"" in love with his Lolita (actual name-Dolores). The writing is flowery, descriptive, even clever in many ways. I was unable to finish the entire book but may go back and skim to the end just to reach closure. Yet I read as much as I could, wanting to see if at this point in my life I would be able to push past the theme and just focus on the quality of the writing."
"1057",1056,"Sohvi","While certainly disturbing in many ways, this is not a bad book. The way it is written is quite poetical, if a bit slow. There are long bits that do not seem to make any progress to the story.However, I did not see why people consider this to be such a great book. As I said, the language is beautiful, but I feel like most people appreciate for the shock value.What I find most disturbing, is how people speak about it. They say this is a book about seductive little vixen who controls man's life. Or - what is even more horrible - they call this ""convincing love story"" (a praise by Vanity Fair, printed on the back of the 50th anniversary edition.) Sure the book is meant to be like memoirs, written by Humbert Humbert himself. But personally I still didn't feel any need to side with him. He is an unreliable narrator, who wishes people to believe him. He needs their pity and understanding, because he too can in some way see that what he does is horribly wrong. And he too says multiple times, that Lolita has no one else to go to. She has no one else, but him.I think it is worrisome how many people actually interpret this book in a way, that Lolita is at least partly responsible, because she seeks attention and affection from Humbert Humbert. That says some really sad things about how little girls are over-sexualized not only inside the pages of this book, but also in reality. The book itself is interesting and even though it was not my favourite, it was okay. I would recommend reading this, if only to better understand discussions and misinterpretations that are rampant in our society. "

"1064",1063,"Chelsey Quack","TL;DR: NABOKOV DID PRETTY GOOD & I LOATHE OUR NARRATOR. My rating of this book may change once my emotions aren't controlling my thoughts as a reader so much.First and foremost, if you're going to be reading my review (well, more of a rant), be aware that I've had a hard time controlling my feelings regarding the narrator. This is largely my frustrated ramblings regarding issues of sexual abuse. But I think it is impossible to read a book of this nature without discussing these issues. I had to rant about it somewhere. But my guess is that if you've made it through this book, or are considering reading it, my thoughts will be the least of your troubles when it comes to trigger warnings.I don't know how to feel about this novel; its content, needless to say, was so hugely uncomfortable for me. This is one of the few times I have needed to keep a cheerful, lighthearted, harmless book nearby, so that when this one became too upsetting for me, I had something to cheer me up directly available. Normally, I have a very positive reaction to novels that make me FEEL so much. But I have very firm thoughts and feelings regarding victim blaming and sexual abuse, which made it very difficult for me to set aside my emotions. My reading experience was totally plagued by a hatred for our revolting narrator. The fact that his ""total adoration"" and ""love"" for Dolores (because, honestly, I have such an issue with referring to her as ""Lolita,"" the name only her abuser called her - this brings up issues of sexual abuse victims being defined by their abuse which I can't really get into here) brings any sort of sympathy out in a reader upsets me. No child is responsible for being abused by an adult. On this note, I will definitely commend Nabokov for bringing to light issues of rapist privilege and victim blaming. Our unreliable narrator manipulates the reader the same way a crying rapist in a courtroom manipulates the jury. Dolores consented as much as a too-drunk person consents. What she wore or how she behaved is not the point, whether she flirted or made the first move is not the point. The point is that the abuser CHOOSES to abuse someone else and this is an issue that continues to, for some reason, be unclear to all abusers and rapist sympathizers. So, what I mean to say by saying all of this, is Nabokov has very effectively brought to light a long term cultural issue regarding sex and consent, and he has gotten into the mind of his narrator amazingly. But, even with his feelings of remorse, and his initial hopes of leaving Dolores ""untainted"" (yeah, because drugging a person to rape them is better than raping them when they're awake), Humbert has absolutely no sympathy from me.Furthermore, Humbert's idea of being ""in love"" with ANYONE the way he treats Dolly is still unforgiveable. Say Dolly had been a fully grown woman - this is still a novel about a guy who is obsessed with controlling his sexual interest, who will not let his ""partner"" talk to other men, go out on her own, etc. Who flies into a jealous rage and literally tears her clothes off when he imagines another man has come onto her. Even if their ages were the same, Humbert is controlling and delusional. Anyways, HERE'S WHAT I THINK ABOUT OUR AUTHOR AND THE WRITING:The writing itself was not quite to my taste. There were some clever word plays and beautiful passages, but sometimes it was a little too flowery for me. Again, pretty amazed at how Nabokov got into our narrator's head. Characterisation was brilliant in its horrifying nature. "

"1089",1088,"Justin","Books are made to provoke, ignite deep thought, and entertain all at the same time. At least, that is what it seems Nabokov sought out when he wrote this highly controversial book. Struggling to read the book through the lens of the 1950s, when relationships between children and adults were likely less vilified (although still quite considering the reaction from various countries and publishing houses) than today where men such as the Humbert Humbert would be listed as nothing more than a sick, soulless child rapist, I was able to greatly appreciate the prose surrounding Nabokov's impressions of Americana, with his observations surrounding tourist traps that highlighted the pre-Interstate highways luring drivers to towns large and small. I wish I could say this was a fantastic novel that everyone should read, but I'm left saying the controversy surrounding the novel has diminished it's potential greatness, which is sad. Had the child been older (and legal), the book would've exceeded expectations. As such, I am left wondering how it was ever published in this state."

"1093",1092,"Kimberlyn","In reviews, critics say that Nabokov creates an empathy for his protagonist. NO. NOT FOR ONE SENTENCE. I do not consider myself to be naive or an unsophisticated reader; however, despite the brilliance of Nabokov's writing style, the analysis of the master/slave dynamic at the bottom of all evil social structures, the thematic use of exile, the touch of the 19th c ""doubling,"" and the address of sexual deviancy, I just felt sick inside as I read it.  Perhaps it is the recent trial of the man who molested my friend's six year old daughter that made this all too real to me. From the moment HH climaxed because Lo sat on his lap, the book was lost to me. There was no redeeming quality in the protagonist, and all I wanted was for someone to blow HH's head clean off of his shoulders. Sadly, this never happened, and as his monologue continued to try to gain empathy from the reader, the more and more I grew ill. Perhaps the book is actually a classic in that way. It depicts the real undeniable sickness within men who break children (and women of any age) and see them merely as objects meant only to satisfy their desires; and this book brutalizes those children (and women) who will do anything in order to survive. A few years ago, an NPR correspondent (a man who lists being a skateboarder before being professor of creative writing at Harvard) warned that ""prospective readers not retreat to any kind of moral high ground."" Sorry, dude, raping children is a flood of evil too deep for my tastes. I'm heading to higher ground. FYI: Dominique Swain was 15 when she filmed Lolita in 1997. Sue Lyon was 14 when she played Lolita in 1962. Neither of them were the 9-year-olds whom HH watches on the playground. Nor were they the 12-year-old Lolita he forces to service him. There is nothing sexy in a child. NOTHING. "
"1094",1093,"Kasia","I wanted to like this book SO bad. I was really prepared to get really into it, but I just couldn't. I'm pretty sure I was supposed to find Humbert Humbert to be a surprisingly sympathetic character. I felt like I was supposed to like him against the odds. But I just didn't. I found his perversion and sexual abuse to be completely appalling and extremely tiring. I also found his character to be strangely flat, and even flatter, the character of Lolita. I suppose I'm glad I read it, but I'm definitely happy it's over. All in all, disappointing."

Thankfully there was no Humbert Humbert in my life taking advantage of that, but, man, talk about hitting too close to home. I didn't want to read through the pages of H.H. flipping out over Lola hanging out with boys. I've lived that, with exes, and I've no desire to re-live it or read about it!

Además que este libro trata de un tema tan polémico que aunque personalmente no me escandalizo sí hubo momentos en los cuales me hizo sentir incómoda y un poco molesta. A pesar de todo me encantó la forma de escribir de Vladimir Nabokov, una forma de escribir tan poética y hermosa. Definitivamente no es un clásico que le gustará a todo el mundo y ese fue mi caso. Pero como cada quién tiene diferentes gusto y preferencias los ánimo a darle una oportunidad."
"1120",1119,"Isa","I think that this book was MAJORLY over hyped in my perspective (or maybe it's just because it's from the perspective of a 15-year-old). I've had this problem where I read classics but don't understand them, partially because of my age, and partly because I don't have a mature enough mindset.Now, Lolita wasn't all that great in my opinion. To me, Lo was a huge snobbish brat, and I think she got it from her mother, who was also a huge snobbish brat. Humbert Humbert was the perfect blend of eloquent and creepy, but his advanced way with words had me confused during some major plot points. I feel as if the French in this novel was a nice touch, but vastly overused. I don't speak french, so I often found myself reaching for my laptop to Google translate what he was saying. This novel (though exceedingly boring in some parts) did have a way of making me squirm in some spots. I wasn't sure whether to sympathize with the despairing Humbert, or to be disgusted with the actions of a middle-aged man. By the end I decided that it was both. I felt a weird pang of sympathy towards the end when he was writing his final goodbyes to Lolita. Though earlier I'd been scowling in disgust and scratching my head in confusion at his words, I found myself deeply saddened by the end paragraph. Because while what he did was NEVER EXCUSABLE IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE, he really was a man in love. I give this book two stars. It would be one, because I really couldn't wait for it to be over, but it made me feel something at the end, so I gave it an extra. Maybe I'll get it when I'm older. "

"1124",1123,"Jaimie","I finished this last night and I have to admit that I am disappointed.I've been looking forward to reading this book for a while now. It started off great, getting to know Humbert Humbert. The whole story is fascinating and Lolita was such an interesting character, as well as Humbert, but after those introductions and a certain death, I thought it turned out boring. The writing is nice. I would kill to write like that, but it was all detail and it happens to be quite bland. I didn't find what was going on interesting enough.I love the story of Lolita, the characters and Nabokov's writing, but those are probably the only things I did like about it. I wasn't sure whether to give this a two star of three star rating, but I'm giving it a two. One star would be too harsh. "

"1134",1133,"Asma","Humbert Humbert came from a seemingly normal environment: he's well educated, and is quite a word master. Except...that he is insane, and is attracted to little girls. After immigrating to America, Humbert lives with a single mother, and her daughter, Lolita, becomes the fixture of his days...This is perhaps the most easiest synopsis I've written, because nothing really happens throughout the book. At the same time, writing this review is a little difficult. I had mixed feelings about this. There's no denying that this book started with beautiful writing. Humbert's words were captivating, expressive, descriptive- I like that in a book. But once he enters pedo-perversion, it's just... I can't help being bias and hating him. Another thing, this book would be awesome for book discussions and classes-- character study, for example. I couldn't help but wonder if Humbert really did tell truths, or lies, or were distortions. Especially since by the end, the book is incoherent with his thoughts. I'd love to have discussed this with someone, just to have ideas bounced back and forth. But reading this for pleasure? Let's just say I need a dose of fluff and Disney and rainbows and really, really happy memories right now."
"1135",1134,"Lyndsey Reed","Dear Nabokov,I get it. You know how to create plays on words. You're SUPER entertained by your ability to do so. Can you just tell the damn story now? This book was so, so eyeroll inducing for me. Was totally relieved when I finally finished it. "
"1136",1135,"JC","Ugh, I couldn't get into this book for the first 100 pages or so. The book was just way too slow to start. Like I typically say, I'd prefer a book that start faster as it will at least grab my attention. I'm sure it had to do with a combination of the translation and Russian books in general (they are usual quite different in terms of style). Also, I was expecting this book to be a bit questionable, but it was pretty clean (guess it was just bad 50+ years ago)."
"1145",1144,"Sindy Li","Someone at a book club said it's his least favorite book because ""it was just about this guy and this girl"", so I decided to see how bad it is. I mostly agree. It was fairly boring until about half way through (which was when I gave up) and the writing wasn't too attractive (though some word plays were cool), even though the events it described were very weird so I read on out of curiosity until I couldn't stand it any more. I jumped to the end and the last few chapters were interesting. But I still don't get how it is deemed to be one of the greatest novels of last century, something like that.It's a story of a sad and sick guy doing something terrible to a girl who wasn't so normal or healthy to begin with, and it damaged both of them. I guess it's an example of obsession that under the disguise of love (which may have turned into love in the end), or at least a very possessive and objectifying kind of love. By describing his ""enemies"" as repulsive (e.g. Charlotte), Humpert managed to make me the reader sympathetic towards him for a while, but when I read that he wanted to reproduce a Lolita the Second and then a Lolita the Third with Lolita, I felt really sick. In the end he realized that he was in love with Lolita herself, not nearly the nymphet, which was a bit touching, but who knows if that's true love or the continuation of obsession."

"1150",1149,"Cynthia Nine","This book has everything I admire in a novel: a beautiful use of the language, wit, the most cunning narrator ever seen and an enigmatic object of adoration. However, having worked as a volunteer with children who suffered abuse in a developing country, I became so sensitive to this subject that I found it excruciatingly painful to get through the pages of Lolita. Reading this was pure agony. I think I only made it to the end because I wanted to see if someone would scalp the rapist Humbert Humbert, cover his open wounds with honey, bury him in an anthill and them force him to fly over the Bermuda Triangle, but none of my dreams came true, so I wasted my sweat on this for nothing.Someone should write a novel from Lolita's perspective. One in which Charlotte doesn't die, the kid goes all ""hard candy"" on Humbert and both girls end up having all sorts of fun torturing him. That would be awesome."

The narrator was not one I could find an iota of sympathy for, and the object of his attraction was nearly equally unsympathetic.

"1201",1200,"Preludes","It has to be said that I didn’t much enjoy Lolita.This is a great shame, since it came so highly recommended. Of course I was happy that I made the effort, though: a classic is a classic, and it always benefits you in some way to read it. Besides, there’s nothing quite so sad as the discarded corpse of a half read book, so I struggled to the end.Vladimir Nabokov the man, as I saw from reading the end commentary that he wrote which was present in my Lolita edition, is a guy that I immediately liked. Funny, passionate and approachable, after reading the notes in the back of the book I felt happy and proud to have read Lolita to the end, as if doing a good friend a favour.Things that I did like in the book was the black humour, the floral description and how paedophilia was handled. It showed the tenderness of Humbert’s adoration of his ‘nymphets’, mixed with the predatory selfishness and filth of it. Lolita herself was no saint either, and the mix of selfishness, innocence, and crudeness of pubescence was perfectly written. You both liked and hated Humbert, and liked and hated Lolita, and felt sorry for them both.Humbert’s occasional poems in the book were a mix of genius and a deliberate naffness that was written to be funny and mocking at the character’s expense, and yet they were both still touching. [You can read one here]Lolita’s eventual mundane fate was utterly real and heartbreakingly bland, which was a grim but poignant commentary on the nature of life itself. The universe doesn’t end with a bang, but a whimper as T.S.Eliot says. Similarily the murder at the end was a confused, blackly comics mess, and also fitting of the shambles that Humbert had become.The book itself, for all of these reasons, has unique and genuinely good elements, hence it’s status as a classic. But it simply didn’t engage me or grab me, and I was often left confused within the story, in part, I am sure, simply because of my drifting boredom.Lolita is not a bad book by any means, but for me it lacks that special something, and therefore I was left bored and unsatisfied."
"1203",1202,"Emily  Sears Cook","I read this when I was in high school. I would give it a second chance, but I would rather read other works by Nabokov.

"1208",1207,"Yasmin Rebelle","The unique style of the writer is what stands out the most however for me a great novel is more than about how it's written. It is about what it conveys. Considering Nabókov did an extensive research for this novel, I would have expected to hear in some form the voice of the survivor of the violence, that of Lolita. Far from being thought provoking, I wouldn't list this book as a must read.**SPOILER ALERT**“Lolita” is a novel about and narrated by Humbert Humbert, an adult male who prides himself on finding prepubescent girls sexually attractive while also blaming them for it. It is unclear how many girls if any he abuses before he meets a 12 year old Lolita but when he does, he skillfully grooms and sexually abuses her. I found the first part of the novel hard to read as it portrays quiet believably the self-justifying and entitled mind of an abuser in his salacious thoughts. The second part reads more like fiction meets reality, while the ending like a fairy tale albeit a horror fairy tale. The strand of realism throughout the novel is that, just like most abusers, the anti-hero seeks power and control over Lolita while using various methods such as isolation, blaming and threats among others. He sees girls and women as mere sexual objects either to ridicule or lust after. Many literary critics, including Nabókov himself talk about a love story. But how can one love someone he objectifies, uses, abuses and never really gets to know? I believe that as a society we need to stop perpetuating rape culture by sensationalizing and/or being fascinated by abusers as well as eroticizing “prepubescent girls”. "
"1209",1208,"Harriet","Just okay..."
"1211",1210,"Rasjel","I found the reading experience slow going, mainly because of the pretentious, bombastic language (which seems a narrative choice, but is mainly annoying to read and makes it hard to keep interest). The upside is the controversial topic, which is at times shocking and thus interesting, but which, as the melodramatic prose continues, one gets ‘used’ to by the way of repetition. I do understand why it is important in the matter of topic, but the text itself did not draw my attention. So, I’d only recommend this novel to people specifically interested in the topic. "
"1212",1211,"Mish","I was pre warned by friends before placing this on my to read list. They said it is distressing and to keep an open mind. I got more than I bargained for. I actually thought I knew what I was in for and had a vague idea of the relationship between Humbert and Lolita. Firstly I didn’t know Lolita’s age (for some reason I thought she was older). Secondly I wasn’t prepared for the intensity of his obsession with her, and the vivid description of how he sees these extremely young girls. From the look and feel of their skin, their characteristics, their beauty, and it was done so in a very sexual way. The book puts you in the mind of a paedophile. It was unsettling and sickening. In my opinion the Author created a real life monster. I don’t exactly know what compelled me to finish this book. Perhaps I wanted to see Humbert punished in some way."

I wonder if the notoriety that surrounds it is more because it focuses on such a controversial subject and not because of any actual superb quality of the writing. Though some moments are well-written, I'm about two-thirds of the way through and much of it seems to drag on and seems more self-important than genuinely engaging. "
"1231",1230,"Esther","I've heard a lot about this book, how it is an accurate portrayal of love and lust. I found the topic interesting after reading a summary of it, and after finding it in my aunt's old room, decided to read it. Right from the very first page, everything was very hard to digest. I had to force myself to get through every page, because it wasn't captivating at all to me. Nothing in the story itself was enough to keep me reading, except for the idea of the story. I was able to feel the protagonist's pain, though, as he watched his Lolita from afar and lusted for her. For people who have suffered from the depths of love, some may find this book touching and compelling. For some however, it might be a book you have to force yourself to read."

In fact I felt it was only that, drawn out to about 400 pages. Obviously this mustn't be the case for all readers, and of course I respect that, but for me-- an anticlimax. "

Sure, it's an odd situation, though probably not as uncommon as people might think, and sure, the language and writing style is off-beat and at times really unique and pleasant to read, but I found myself frequently bored by the plot, in which about five things of great significance happen, and not really caring about any of the characters and what happens to them."

They are copying what they've seen or dealing with the new emotions that they are going through. It's not meant for old men to take advantage of them. And then to shoot the guy who rescued her! Again, not what I was expecting when I wanted to read this novel."

"1275",1274,"David Pimenta","Foram inúmeras as vezes em que coloquei a ideia de desistir da leitura deste livro de lado e quando ela começa a fazer-se sentir na minha cabeça não é lá muito bom sinal. A maioria das críticas que tinha lido sobre Lolita eram positivas, favoráveis e por isso comecei a ler com bastante curiosidade. E agora sinto-me com dificuldades em escrever a crítica com base numa leitura incompleta. Cheguei à página 220 mas como não estava a tirar prazer da minha leitura resolvi parar.Lolita conta a história de Humbert Humbert na primeira pessoa. Tomamos conhecimento de que está preso (e, sinceramente, não consegui chegar ao fim deste livro para saber a razão por detrás desta detenção) e a partir desse ponto, HH começa a contar-nos a sua história recorrendo à sua memória. A sua infância, tendo em conta o trauma com Anabela, até à idade adulta em que desenvolve uma atracção especial pelas “ninfitas” ou, para meros cidadãos, pelas meninas entre os doze/treze anos. Relata a sua mudança para Ramsdale, para a casa de Charlotte Haze e a obsessão pela sua filha de doze anos, Dolores ou Lolita, que irá ser uma peça importante para o decorrer da história.Para mim, esta foi uma história que custou a entranhar logo ao início. Não ganhei aquele gosto pela personagem principal mesmo sendo um monstro, na minha opinião. A obsessão, a descrição da paixão de Humbert pelas ninfitas fez-me especial confusão, tive de colocar um pequeno escudo nos meus pensamentos e dar ênfase ao pensamento “Isto é apenas ficção” para continuar a ler. Compreendo porque é que muitos consideram este livro como genial. Começando pela forma como foi escrito. É de louvar a escrita de Nobokov. Foi um dos aspectos que me manteve preso à Lolita mas não me fez ganhar a curiosidade para chegar ao fim do livro.A história enrola, enrola e volta a enrolar mais uma vez numa espécie de ciclo vicioso. Tudo o que acontece envolta de HH e Lolita não interessa e cheguei a achar as descrições bastante maçudas e muito prolongadas. Este pode ser um dos melhores livros que por aí andam mas não é por muitos gostarem que vou dizer que gostei.Não gostei deste livro. E a minha classificação só não é mais baixa devido a escrita fabulosa. Aconselho-o a quem aprecie clássicos. Lolita é um clássico e apaixonou muitas pessoas. Eu não fui uma delas, infelizmente.2/5 "
"1282",1281,"kylajaclyn","The blurbs on this book (well, my copy of it) are both true and false. Vanity Fair proclaims this book ""the only convincing love story of our century."" False. But, on the back, John Updike says that Nabokov writes prose ""the way it should be written, that is, ecstatically."" True. Everything he writes in Lolita feels like a fever dream. Which probably isn't too far off the mark, since Humbert Humbert is an unreliable narrator. But, reliable or not, this book is still very troubling. I've had one teacher say several times that if you, at any point in the book, feel sorry or sympathize with Humbert, than Nabokov has succeeded at his job. This is a hot topic right now, particularly for women writers, but why do protagonists need to be sympathetic? Can't they just be a villain or repulsive and still have a compelling story that we don't need to sympathize with to be interested in or entertained by? I never once felt anything for Humbert. I'm pretty neutral to him overall. This is a man who, from the beginning of the novel, admits he has murdereristic (new word) tendencies that he later follows through on. This is a man who marries the mother of the 12-year-old girl he worships just so he doesn't have to leave her side. He then becomes the stepfather of Lolita and essentially kidnaps her and takes her around the country once her mother dies. Then he DRUGS Lolita so he can rape her in her sleep (thus somehow, though I'm not sure how in any mind, avoid taking her ""innocence""). Little does he know that she's already had sex at summer camp. The point of this book, for me, was to find out if they really were going to sleep together. They do, quite early on. But H.H. claims that Lolita came onto HIM, and this is especially troubling for me, because this is where we get the idea (or at least adding fuel to the idea) that little children should be sexualized and may, in fact, already be sexual creatures. However, Lolita is utterly ridiculous and whiny throughout the book, and she never seems to care much for her ""dad."" She sneaks away to ""cheat"" on him multiple times. But he also always wants sex from her and often bribes her for it in various ways. He keeps her prisoner, and this book is the best case for Stockholm Syndrome I can think of (well, maybe not entirely. She never completely falls in love with him, after all). Upon falling sick two years into their journey, she is kidnapped from the hospital by another man, her former drama teacher, while H.H. himself is sick and unable to be with her. H.H. spends the next three years in despair looking for her. When he finally meets Lolita again, she is 17 and pregnant and married (what a wonderful life). Not to the drama teacher, however, but to a different man. Naturally Lolita will not leave her husband for him, so H.H. hunts down Quilty, the drama teacher, and kills him. If this be love..."

I could not get over the old man seducing a young under-age girl and seeing it as ""literary"" and I'm perfectly fine with that. If after two sincere attempts to appreciate the book,I still could not get into it, then perhaps sometimes, even great works of literature are not for all of us. I would have given it a 1-star but I want to be generous and give it a 2-star if only because my very literary friend Rebekah shared some insights that I could have appreciated, had I read more into the book.... but alas, I didn't.

I didn't care particularly for any of the characters. They are all self-important and self-absorbed to the point of being repetitive, boring and annoying. They don't develop or go anywhere.

Were the subject matter different, I would give this book five stars. I give it two because of how revolting I find the actions of H.H. As someone who works with children, I tend to see the work more from a child's point of view and found it painful to read. I feel that part of the ""acclaim"" of the book was due to it's subject matter, and it has been glorified for being extreme. "
"1345",1344,"Leon","If Nabokov had decided to include line breaks in his magnum opus Lolita and claim it was an epic poem, I doubt few would have batted an eye. This novel written as a memoir of obsessive pedophile Humbert Humbert is nothing if not lyrically florid. Nabokov's skill with the English language eclipses that of the average storyteller - in fact, his English is so hyper-fluent that he dips into French.Yet if Nabokov wields his linguistic prowess as a shotgun, he loads it with foam pellets. Lolita is like a Romeo and Juliet without the feuding families and the deaths. That is to say, the plot is for the most part a meandering journey with a destination already met, not unlike a plane taxiing around its arrival gate. The characters also do not command much force. From the book's inception to its denouement, Humbert is characterized as a pedophile, no more and no less. Even the eponymous Lolita (aka Dolores Haze) remains arguably little more than the object of Humbert's amour, not to mention how disposable the other characters are (and they are disposed of indeed - few characters last more than a handful of chapters).It can be deduced that this book is less about its plot and characters as it is about the idea: an homage to unsanctioned love. Similar to the piece Homage to the Square, Lolita thus bears artistic merit. Still, with both, this reader would have preferred more content in the traditional sense.Finally, there is the frustration in dealing with the writing style. A single sentence may last half a page or more and address everything and nothing at the same time. It is commendable, though, that even with this particular subject, Nabokov declines to stoop to explicit sex scenes. E.L. James would have had a field day.I would give a guarded recommendation to Lolita based on this first reading, but there are possible reasons to revisit this declared masterpiece. Nabokov's writing is surely something to aspire to, and who knows what a might closer reading might reveal?Overall: 7/10P.S. Were there really ""morning snow storms of used tissue paper that a train passenger sees whirling in the wake of the observation car"" (p.15)? If so, I am glad we are now beyond such barbarism."
"1346",1345,"Vencislav Popov","This joins the ranks of all the books I tried to read because they are either classics or touted as classics-to-be, which in the end I could not finish for the life of me. The language is a delight and it excited me in the beginning, but aside from that reading it was an utter drudgery. What is the point of being able to weave beautifully intricate webs of words, if your choice of subject matter is appalling and the story is going nowhere? Oh, well, this seems to be an intrinsic quality of most classics or overly-hyped books I dread - all talk and no substance. If your building is crumbling who cares if the facade is breath-taking?"

"1368",1367,"Kakihara","I just don't know where to begin... Seems to me that Mr. Nabokov wanted to be a Mr. Humbert Humbert back in the 50´s but he wasn't able to do so, so he decided to write a book about his feelings, as it happens now a days to many either men or women that wish they had their own Lolitas. Although I continue to believe there is a Lolita in every single woman and sure there has to be a Mr. Humbert in every single man that doesn't really mean we can not control those feelings about people we are to love. Mr. Humbert is actually a controller, he does not really care about Lolita´s feeling and welfare, he only cares about himself, about his life about his soul. He fears to be lonesome, all by himself (He should´ve read Bridget Jones Dairy or at least written something like this instead). If Dolores´ mother hadn't passed away... sure the book might´ve been called differently... so it is really hard for me to say that moral Mr. Humbert was really in love with Lo, at least Lolita was not in love with him and was even brave enough to run away from that kind of filthy men and start a new life after all... good for her bad for Mr. Humbert who even to the end of the novel, continues to justify his sort of greedy LOVE.

"1371",1370,"Gabriela Pop","While the writing style itself was rather familiar with it's typical European je ne sais quoi,the story was dreadful.Don't get me wrong,I was expecting something controversial,knowing the main ideas behind the book,but this was pure crazy.I have never hated a character as much as I have the protagonist of this,I found him utterly dreadful and his view on life and everything else disgusting.Sadly,there weren't any other characters to like,there was honestly nothing I personally liked about this story and I surely wouldn't recommend it."
"1373",1372,"Claire Smith","It was difficult to rate this book. From a purely technical writing perspective, it was very good. But the topic made me feel like I was reading the book at arms length with my head partly turned away. It had a morbid fascination, abit like that maggoty dead cat you can't not look at in the gutter.It's been described as a great love story, and the story of a sexually precocious girl, but quite frankly I saw no evidence of love. Lolita is described as crying every night, she plots to run away from from vain, arrogant Humbert. Humbert abuses her sexually,physically and psychologically. He steals the money he brides her with, he rapes her when she is unwell, he kills the man who eventually helps her escape (who incidentally delivers her to what sounds like a house of sex slaves). Yes she was sexually precocious, at 12 she has sex with a boy her own age, but I feel this does not excuse his actions . She develops a crush on Humbert, but there is no excuse for him taking some extensive advantage of her. I'm glad I read it, but I don't feel it provided me with any new insights into a paediophils psyche. Of course this is not the point of hte book."

I think in general, based off of what I was able to stomach, Nabokov is a gifted and natural, enthusiastic writer. The majority of his prose is aesthetically pleasing (I do love me a good juicy bit of imagery!) and enjoyable to read it but every once and a while, his writing still would drift off into the overwrought and ridiculous, boring (so, so numbingly boring) and contrived. Pages upon pages of description I didn't find necessary or interesting (or similes that were too cheesy or fluffed up even for me, a lover of all things cliché) interrupted the flow of the narrative and left me struggling to keep the pages open.I really wanted to finish and enjoy this book for many reasons— because it's a classic, because I wanted to understand if the controversy of the novel is much more complex than the creepy, pedophiliac stigma it has, and for more selfish reasons, I want to return to the level of avid reading that I have recently lost and finish a book, something I've found hard to do lately— but I can't do it. Obviously I haven't finished it but from what I read, I haven't found any satisfaction in Nabokov coming to an enlightened conclusion of the undeservingly-romanticized May-December dynamic in the novel and I don't feel any sympathy for the narcissistic protagonist Humbert. Maybe the rest of the book does show a moral about not dismissing Humbert's obsession as love or passion— because that's not what this is—, but I don't think I can keep reading to find out. All in all, I don't think we can dismiss that Nabokov knows how to wield a pen and write gorgeously, but I don't think the story could have been drawn out as long as it was. But that is simply my opinion, my perspective could stem from me being a bit restless and impatient depending on the book (which can make reading a little difficult). So, if anyone else has read it and found it better than I did, tell me why, and perhaps in a few years when I distance myself from it I'll give Lolita another chance.I wish there was a 2.5 star rating, the extra .5 score being because Lolita must be a classic for a reason, and because at rare points the book was slightly stimulating and a pleasant, swift read."
"1413",1412,"Kaat V","Lolita van Nabokov aan het lezen. Het boek kwam hier in mijn bezit wegens de aktie 'verboden boeken' van De Morgen. Het valt mij moeilijk een boek niét uit te lezen, omdat ik mezelf dan verdenk van gebrek aan doorzetting dan, of mezelf wijsmaak dat ik ook dingen moet lezen die mij niet in de smaak vallen, zoals ik in Azië of in de Magreb ook wel dingen proef die ik ook niet zo vlug zou eten hier. Maar om zo in de geest van een pedofiel kruipen ... het is bijna teveel gevraagd. De man heeft maar één verlangen : zijn seksuele driften bot te vieren op nimfijnen, oftewel meisjes tussen de 8 en 14. Alles is daarvoor goed : het gebruik van pillen, en als het nodig zou blijken, het vermoorden van de moeder. Een ziekelijke geest is het. Maar ziekelijk staat niet voor 'niet te verantwoorden'. In mijn zoektocht naar achtergrond informatie vond ik dat het bij sommige Nederlandse scholieren op de boekenlijst van het vierde jaar staat. "
"1416",1415,"Beth Morris","Sorry folks. I know the topic of Lolita is very scandalous and has been banned for unfit content, but I found this book incredibly boring. I couldn't take anymore of the traveling dialogue. I found myself skimming and skimming the more I read. The beginning was interesting as was the end, but the middle barely held my attention. "
"1417",1416,"Rachel Swords","""Lolita"" is, without a doubt, one of the most controversial literary classics of time. Because of that, anyone who loves to read, or is an aspiring writer, or an English major, should read it. Though some of the shock value has worn off, ""Lolita"" is still an eyebrow-raiser of a book. Though pedophilia has become more visible thanks to media coverage, it's still shocking to see it defended and celebrated within the pages of Nabokov's work. By now, even casual readers know the basic plot: older man lusts after and has an affair with an underage girl. Humbert Humbert (WHY is he named that? Someone tell me) is one of literature's most debated anti-heroes. He's constantly feeling sorry for himself, and as the story progresses, the reader can see his relationship with Lolita, or Dolores as is the girl's real name, progress from infatuation, to lust, to borderline-psychotic possession. By the end, it's no wonder that his Lolita escapes him. And it is very obvious by the end that Humbert is unstable. For example: Humbert is devastated when Lolita tells him she will not return to him and says in so many words that she never loved him. He briefly considers his treatment of her over the years and seems remorseful-but only for a minute, choosing instead to wallow in self-pity and continuously place her on a pedestal. And then there is Lolita herself, Dolores Haze. Here's where the book gets really interesting: it's a bit hard to feel sorry for her, even though she is the victim of Humbert's affections and must grant him sexual favors for any semblance of a normal teenage life. She's a spoiled brat for the whole story, and I only felt for her when she was sick and during her final appearance in the story. Does she play upon Humbert's emotions at the beginning? Possibly. The story is not clear; it's up to the reader. Does she deserve what she gets from him? Of course not. But over the course of the book, it's clear that she does her best to manipulate the situation, getting Humbert to buy her anything she wants. It's only as Dolores/Lolita advances in age that the story gets really dark and a genuine concern for this character arises: Humbert does not want his Lolita to become a young woman, and does everything in his power to repress this natural stage of life, by forbidding her fraternization with boys her age, throwing out any makeup she owns, and stealing money from her. The most alarming section was, for me, when he interrogates her activity with a classmate from school; it's in this scene that we see how disturbed Humbert is, and how possessive he is of his young stepdaughter. Now that I've written a book on the book, all I can say is go read ""Lolita."" If nothing else, you'll get to see what all the fuss is about. "
"1420",1419,"Margie","Always heard about this book. Decided to try it myself. Not anything like I had anticipated. The author goes on and on. The Character Humbert is a very unstable individual. The girl is also unstable but I felt she was trapped into the relationship and found a way to leave. I would not recommend this to people growing up in our culture today."

"1430",1429,"Blake","Considering all the controversy, this was a boring read."
"1431",1430,"Tita","Sebelum ini, saya hanya mendengar reputasi buku Lolita ini. Setelah membaca sendiri, rasanya Lolita kok nggak sehebat pamornya. Mungkin ini dipengaruhi harapan yang terlalu tinggi, atau mungkin juga karena ada rasa nggak 'sreg' membaca versi Indonesianya. Mungkin, suatu hari, kalau dapet versi Inggrisnya akan saya coba baca lagi... "

"1442",1441,"Yvensong","I'm having a real hard time rating this novel. The writing is superb. Nabokov's grasp of the English language is amazing considering this is his third(?) language. The storyline, the protagonist, and pretty much all the other characters are unlikeable or too shallow to care about at all. You only see the other characters through the eyes of the protagonist, and he's so twisted that only seeing these other people as unlikeable and/or shallow works well for the story. He really only pays any real attention to his Lolita, the young girl he's convinced himself that he loves. There were times I had considered not bothering to finish the story, yet like watching a train heading toward its doom, I followed Humbert through the well-written prose to his impending doom. I still can't say whether I'm glad I did or not. "
"1443",1442,"Katherine","To be honest, I could not finish this book. It was way too detailed and disturbing for my liking... I could not make enough time to want to read it and go through. I give it 2**s ... Maybe I will pick it up again when I decide to be more committed to it."
"1444",1443,"Ken Schroeder","I get that we don't usually get into the mind of perversion and all that. But, #1: Why do I need to? #2: It gets kind of boring. ""I saw a beautiful nymphette with her supple..."". I feel like he says versions of that sentence like 15 times. "

"1447",1446,"Emily Ann Meyer","I can see why this is considered a significant book. That does not mean I enjoyed it. In fact, I really had to push myself to not just toss it aside. It was mysogynistic and rather disturbing. I found the protagonist's rationalizations thought provoking, but by part 2 and the development of the narrative rationalizations, I was disturbed."
"1450",1449,"Sanam","I found this ""great book"" to be overrated. OK, so for the first 30 some pages, i was completely blown away. I had never read Nabokov; it was a revelation. I loved every word, and that i needed to keep a dictionary close by. Then, i got bored--his writing style was not enough to keep me engaged. I found the story and characters boring, repetitive, and unconvincing. It took at least 3 months for me to get the motivation to finish it. I was relieved to put it away and it is even tedious for me to think/write about the experience. 2 stars for the initial, short-lived love."
"1452",1451,"Will Whatley","I don't think I gave Nabokov a fair chance on my go-round with this. So I actually don't know if the novel is just not that great, or if I slighted it by reason of prudery or haste."
"1453",1452,"Taylor Dinehart","Ugh. How completely boring can one book be? The writer lists every little tiny thing in his head and describes things in such detail that I had to skip whole sections to stop myself from falling asleep. I don't want to know every single state they travel to, or the name of every lodge, or every little inconsequential moment in Lolita and H. H.'s sad life. If fact, I felt nothing for either of the characters and didn't care what happened to them. I was not shocked and offended by Humbert's thoughts or actions, and I didn't think Lolita deserved anything better than what she got. Also, the dialogue was stilted and just odd. Overall, an very unsatisfying and sleep inducing read."
"1457",1456,"Nicola","Well I can truthfully say that reading Lolita is something I have been meaning to do for many years, so in that sense I'm delighted to have done so. For the rest... I'm not as impressed as I thought I would be. The writing is beautiful and the memories and desires inside Humberts head suitably skin crawling, the narrator, Jeremy Irons certainly did a fine job bringing him to life.With all that though, hmm, I'm still a trifle disappointed.I had read many reviews commenting about feeling sympathy for the monster, some which even suggest it was a little romantic and I can honestly say that these comments shocked me more than anything in the book. Due to these sorts of phrases I expected Humbert to cover his tracks more than he did, to present himself in a better light, but, no. His every disgusting thought, his hypocrisy concerning his nightly rapes, everything was laid bare. There was no verbal seduction, the vile Humbert stood bare, condemned from his own mouth. So, I was disappointed; I wanted a moral conflict within myself and there was none.For the rest I thought it dragged, the last half of the book that is. It was no longer engrossing, everything became a bit stale.I rate this 2 1/2 stars"

"1463",1462,"Randy Ray","I didn't care for the book. The narrator's voice was irritating, and his obsession with young girls, is pitiful and creepy. I'm not prudish, as a general rule, and I'm not offended by sexual content--I just didn't think Humbert Humbert (the narrator and main character) is someone I can relate to. I was surprised that I didn't get more enjoyment from this novel, as I liked Kubrick's film quite a bit."
"1465",1464,"Alexandra Hernández","Se me hizo eterno terminar. Aunque debo admitir que hubo capítulos que sí disfruté, siento que hubo mucho relleno. Me sorprende la empatía que llegué a sentir por Humbert, aceptando su pedofilia y sin embargo sufriendo también por todo lo que debió pasar Lo."
"1467",1466,"umberto","I read about this notorious novel in the early 60's while studying in a secondary school. From a Thai semi-academic journal, I first knew its strange, improper episodes between an oldish man and a youngish girl named Lolita whose age & innocent beauty unintentionally entice the man who appears to know & travel with her mother. It was quite a psychological uproar then, I mean it was one of the hot issues in the decade worldwide regarding the novel content and such perversion of those unthinkable couple inapproprite to any female teenager or gentleman to follow suit. A few years ago, I decided to buy this paperback to read but I couldn't keep going due to my gradually lost interest (I'm too busy to waste my time) so I stopped somewhere and would resume reading it according to my sufficient familiarity with some of his works."

"1469",1468,"Shonna Froebel","This is one of the ones that everyone has heard about, but not a lot of people seem to have read. I finally decided to tackle it as I heard this audio version was very good.Jeremy Irons does a wonderful job on bringing this novel to life.The novel was so different than I expected it to be. So much sadder than I had thought. It also covered so much of America of that time period that really gave me a feel for the culture of the time.It was sometimes hard to remember that this novel was set in the late 1940s and early 1950s, as there seems to be so much going on that I thought of as being more recent. I loved the descriptive passages, both of the geography and culture of the travels, and of Humbert's description of the people he interacted with, especially his descriptions of Lolita.Lolita is knowing, yet naive; complicit, yet coerced; and this duality of her nature makes her even more interesting.Some of the middle dragged a bit for me, so I was glad of the wonderful audio to keep me going with it. The end was worth it."
"1470",1469,"Rosie","Uncomfortable reading in parts but Nabokov's use of language is brilliant"
"1471",1470,"Ym","Overrated.'It will change the way you think' and 'it's disquieting because it makes the reader sympathize with a pedophile' - nope, not in the least. He's a disgusting, morally void pervert. Period.The prose is unexceptionable and beautiful at times, however, and the character development well executed. Hence the two stars."
"1474",1473,"Crisel Blenda Bautista","The unconventional and disturbing confession of Humbert is totally different from all the stories we have today or to all the stories that I have read so far. With the character’s point-of-view, the author was able to create a powerful, real and unique character as well as interesting subjects.Humbert’s character is both interesting and disturbing. The author’s explicit and creative telling of his character’s motive is enough for the readers to understand the dilemma the character is feeling. Furthermore, with the author’s ingenuity, it was understandably conceived in the story, the deep love he is feeling for Lolita. With unconventional use of words and incorporation of literary devices, such as metaphors and allegories, this world of Humbert became real. I may express my fascination towards the book, but in reality, it doesn’t suit my interest. Having no native tongue with the language that the author used, I had a hard time understanding what is being conveyed. In some occasions, my mind wanders while I was reading. Being lost during in the story really upsets me. My mind can’t seem to comprehend the unfamiliar and totally absurd words or phrases and metaphors present in the book. The use of French is also a pressure on my part, as it adds to my increasing confusion. With my limited capacity to comprehend the style of the author in storytelling, I have failed to notice small details that make up the totality of the story.But I think, more than Humbert’s character, Lolita herself is an interesting and “good different” character. Creating the topic about pedophilia may utterly disturb others but it can also kindle fires of understanding towards these kinds of characters. Books are meant to give us something, it can be a lesson or experience that we are yet to experience. But what this particular story has given its readers is the kind of love that is unfamiliar and impossible. I am not condoning such act, but to put it into words with creativity is something. Literarians will surely enjoy reading this. Critics, I think will be pleased, since it has transcended the common expectations for books. However, for an ordinary reader who seeks pleasure in reading, and moralist, I guess, this book is too much. The StoryThe story is about a twenty plus year old man called Humbert, who romantically and sexually desired female child half of his age. This desire seems to be rooted when he was young and was about embark in sexual endeavors with his childhood friend, Annabel. But Annabel died and he was left curious. And that curiosity remains with him until he gets old. Now, he continues to seek the companionship of partners too young for him. Later on, he married with the thought that his desire will disappear. But to his dismay, his random copulation with his wife only sparks more fire in him in desiring younger maidens. His wife has also grown cold towards him. Not long enough his wife asked for divorce since she has fallen in love with a man during their marriage and wishes to live with this man. Humbert was furious especially when his wife has introduced the man to him. He tried to control himself from not killing the two. After that encounter, he let himself fall in his immoral desire. He sought the company of young whores, but before he could enjoy the child, he was caught. He tried to prove his innocence just to get out of the situation. Fortunately, because of his creative excuse of using the child as a literary subject for his project he was acquitted of the crime. He was about to live with a friend, but due to some unfortunate circumstances he was led to live with the Haze. Here, he was welcomed by Charlotte Haze a widow and the mother of Lolita. Upon seeing the beautiful and young Lolita, Humbert knew that he has to be with this child. He looks Lolita not with a father’s eye, but with a deprived lover.Lolita, being young, stubborn and rebellious has shown motives towards Humbert making his desire towards her unbearable. So when Lolita left for summer camp, he thought of ways on how to be with his love. Fortunately, to his part, he found himself being desired by Lolita’s mother, Charlotte. Charlotte has expressed her love to him and told him to leave the house immediately if Humbert doesn’t feel the same way too, for staying in the Haze’s house after this confession will become difficult. Upon knowing this, Humbert accepted her love. He knows that once he is wed with Charlotte being with Lolita will be easier and he will not be suspected of anything since he will become the legal father of the child. He let Charlotte do everything and pretended to love the woman. Charlotte was utterly happy with the requited love she has received from Humbert but was devastated immediately when she found Humbert’s letters which explicitly tells his motive why he has wedded her. Furious, he confronted Humbert. Humbert tried to explain to appease her. But she was too hurt that she drove away until she met her end in a fateful accident. With what happened, Humbert was left with the guardianship to Lolita. He immediately went after her. Lolita with all her youthfulness and beauty was made to live with Humbert. They travelled far away from the people they know and Humbert made Lolita his little wife. He was able to get what he wanted. He was too happy to be with his love but also too anxious with her since she might tell others about their relationship and escape. He was able to convince little Lolita to not tell anyone about the two of them. However, it was not long when Humbert became unease and frantic when he found out that someone has been following them and Lolita is devising something with this suspicious man. After travelling and living only in hotels and motels, Lolita fell ill and was hospitalized, when she was about to leave the hospital, Humbert too, fell ill. He was unable to retrieve Lolita. This led him to be separated from her. When he recovered, he immediately looked for her but years passed and he failed to find her. Finally, after so many years, Humbert received a letter from Lolita telling him that she was married and pregnant and she needed financial help to sustain her current life. It was hard to believe, but when he saw Lolita with a swelling belly and the changed in her form, realities fell upon him. Losing his hope towards his Lolita, he gave her all the money more than what she expected, all from him and from the money left by her mother. But before leaving he wanted to know what happened the day they parted. He was furious to confirm his suspicion that the man following them before, was the one who kidnapped Lolita and ruined her. With vengeance, he sought the man and put justice in his hands as he theatrically killed the man whom he believed is the cause of all his heart’s sorrows. "
"1480",1479,"Gloria Shealtiel","I was less able to enjoy the book.Since the narrative style seemed very real, I kinda got into the pedophile relationship AND I was pretty frightened, made me not comfortable reading.But anyway, beyond my very personal perspective, this book is remarkable. You'll see that the man loves Lolita because of a quite reasonable odd reason."
"1482",1481,"Simon_Cleveland_Ph.D. Simon_Cleveland_Ph.D.","Is reading Lolita a memorable experience? Not in the least.In it's essence the book leaves a very unpleasant aftertaste with its central theme of pedophilia.

"1502",1501,"Shayna","This is a book I don't think I will ever be able to finish. As beautiful and bright as the writing is, the stark contrast of the content revolts me. I have a strong visceral reaction when I read it. After a few pages, I'm forced to put the book down for a year or so before I try to pick it up again. I've only been able to make it halfway through.Seeing the cover of the book on this page doesn't help either, because the featured girl is my darling niece's doppelgänger.I found a fellow reader's review that says everything I feel when reading this novel:This review says it all:Jan 04, 2012 Tatiana rated it:· review of another editionRecommends it for: those who will not fall for Humbert's liesShelves: classics, 1001, 2012, national-book-awardI wasn't even going to write a review of Lolita after finishing it, because, honestly, how many reviews does this classic need? That is, until I started pocking around and reading what others have to say about it. Many reactions to this book are puzzling to me. In this world of Jerry Sanduskys and such, there are still people who find this ""erotic,"" who in the end feel compassionate towards the narrator, who think that Lolita was the one who seduced and manipulated poor Humbert? Well, I beg to differ. Lolita is as erotic as Speak is pornographic. As for favorable opinions of Humbert, I guess it is possible this effect can be attributed to Nabokov's mastery of deception. Clearly, Humbert still, half a century after the novel's publication, manages to fool readers, and himself, into believing that he is a dedicated, caring lover, wounded and changed by an early tragic romance. Only occasionally does the truth bleed through his self-delusion - Lolita's wistful glance at a child sitting on his father's lap, a simple act that is forever sallied by Humbert's filth, her disinterest in life, her resignation to satisfy him for pocket money and permission to participate in a school play. No, Humbert did not fool me into feeling sorry for him. On a technical level, Lolita deserves full 5 stars - the language, the wit, the world play! - I don't think I've ever read anything like this before. But emotionally this look into a pedophile's psyche is so disgusting, I can't quite bring myself to rate it so. Humbert is so sickly real to me, with his apologies, justifications of his behavior, cowardice, sob stories and bending of reality, how does an author create someone like this? How did Nabokov get such an intimate knowledge of someone so despicable?"
"1504",1503,"Linda Matos Di Lascio","This is one of those books that plagues me because (as ashamed as I am to admit it) I never finished reading it. Once they got to their boring cross country trek of monotony I lost interest. I felt bad enough to try picking up where I left off many times but it always ends with me angered that I even tried. "
"1506",1505,"Luis","In my honest opinion. My opinion. Mine. Opinion. Not necessarily true.The writing is too much. It is so magnificent at first. I thought, What a very lyrical way to start a book about a forbidden love. But then after a hundred pages or so, I started to notice it doesn't change. It won't change. (I peeked at the latter chapters.) Outstanding wordplay becomes too tiring for me to read. I couldn't understand the sentences without rereading them again 2-3 times. Or reading them slowly. By then I just gave up. I do not have every time in the world. I skimmed. I just decided to read the summary on the Internet. (A CRIME! I know. The story based on the summaries is actually interesting.)I repeat: Wordplay is genius. Too much wordplay is tiring and boring. For me.I mean, after some time, I just want to hear the story continuously. After some time, I do not want your excellent wordplay sacrificing my continuous indulgence of the story. I want the story, and if your writing helps the story, I will want it more. But if your writing hinders me to soak myself with the story, forget it and go straight to the point.I repeat: In my honest opinion. My opinion. Mine. Opinion. Not necessarily true to all. But I know some are with me with this opinion.Another note is I did note rate this book 2 stars because of pedophilia. Hell, I have read stories more disturbing than that. This is because I just cannot stand the writing anymore,, but the story is interesting.And I do not extremely hate pedos. For me, pedophilia is just another orientation. It so happens that, like say a guy wants another guy, a pedo likes a child. Simple. What makes pedophilia not acceptable is that a pedo, realizing he will not be sexually and acceptably satisfied for his WHOLE LIFE, becomes obsessed and he will be forced to find an illegal way to satisfy his lust. This is because we all know that a child doesn't have any idea about sex so it will always seem to every one that the pedo is forcing the child for a sexual act. And that act of forcing is the one we cannot accept today. It's rape. I don't want to accept pedophilia, not because of the wanting of a pedo to a child per se, but because of the things a pedo could do to an innocent child."

"1518",1517,"Andrea Dowd","The only two reasons I gave ""Lolita"" two stars is because pedophilia is a bit difficult of a subject to read (especially when 90% of the reading of the novel took place on public transportation with small children around...gross) and because half of the book was continual rambling (because it's a novel about obsession). Aside from my pervert aversion, the writing was spectacular, vivid, and extremely descriptive. ""Lolita"" is one of those perennial ""read before you die"" book an it's no wonder. Read it because you should and put your uncomfortable feeling aside just to get a taste of Nabokov's prose."
"1519",1518,"Locked Asylum","I really don't know what to say. My feelings are just so dual regarding this book. This is one of those books that you have to rummage for a while, I guess."
"1521",1520,"Brandice","Parts of the book were interesting but overall I found it boring. The author has a very wordy writing style I began to find tiresome about halfway through. He paints some vivid images with all his words, but just became a little much once the plot started to wane. "

"1525",1524,"Wolverina","Finished reading Lolita today, for a cheerful start to the New Year.I really can't write much about it here because despite my dislike of trigger warnings, it IS a very triggery kinda book. And creepy. Amazingly creepy.I didn't like it, but I'm guessing you aren't really supposed too. Or if you are, I am just not enough of an artist to care. The flowery language and descriptions is very pretty and all, but really the book goes on much too long, so it gets boring fast.Australia Post are still numbnuts for refusing to sell it amongst the other popular penguins though. It's a lot of adult things, but its not porn."
"1529",1528,"Shawna","Middle-aged guy likes early-teenaged girls. And ruins Lolita's life. The language, most of the time, is not very explicit, but the concept is still disturbing. "
"1530",1529,"silvia ","Se por um lado adorei o estilo de escrita de Nabokov, alias esse foi o factor crucial para não ter desistido desta leitura; por outro lado não achei a historia nada apelativa. Gosto de leituras pesadas, perturnadoras que me façam para para pensar e era disso que estava a espera em Lolita. Confesso que no inicio a odescrição da obsessão de Humber Humbert fez as mihas tripas mexerem-se em desconforto mas depois com mais do mesmo devo ter começado a ficar anestesiada eo aborrecimento apoderou-se de mim.O predador Humbert não é uma figura nada simpatica, mas é torna-se tão patetico que é dificil gastar energias a detesta-lo. Lolita é descrita apenas pela visão adulterada de humbert, nunca sabemos o que se passa realmente na cabeça dela, podemos imaginar obviamente. Mas para mim Lolita quase que não foi uma personagem real no livro, tive dificuldades para ver para alem da lolita fantasia e assim sentir simpatia pelo sofrimento da lolita real.concluindo foi-me dificil terminar este livro não por me chocar mas por me estar a casar um entediamento terrivel."
"1531",1530,"Sierra Stoney","Well-written, but way too creepy for me to enjoy. It didn't help that a girl in my class asserted that it is the ""[best book] in the English language"". I could hold that phrase against the speaker, but I find it impossible to isolate the statement from the book as a whole. "
"1532",1531,"Tin Wee","Enter the mind of a pedophile - he explores how it started in a frustrated young love, how he tried to get close to a landlady's daughter. He marries the landlady to stay close to the daughter, and subsequently brings her on a sordid tour of America after the landlady dies in a car accident, and takes revenge by killing the 'saviour' of the daughter. The book also details the moral deterioration of the daughter, and explore themes of escapism and human relationships - primarily through the lens of jealousy and different types of love. The prose is technically brilliant - despite the theme it was never vulgar, but the story itself is obscene and not for the faint of stomach."
"1533",1532,"Vera","I obviously failed as a reader of this book.Vladimir Nabokov writes in his afterword that people who expected a book in the line of 'Memoirs of a Woman of pleasure' will be disappointed. He writes that readers got bored when the erotical scenes stopped. I guess I am one of those persons. So expectation ruined the experience? Maybe. I did enjoy Part I a lot. The first part of the book is about how Humbert got to learn Lolita, how he marries her mother just to be able to close to be her, and how he eventually rapes her after her mother dies (for which he, indirectly, bears the blame). There is this tension building up to that moment, and it's done beautifully. It's not the erotic that kept me interested, it just was the story. I found it intriguing to read what's going on in a paedophile mind, and a mentally distorted mind on top of that. But in Part II, when Humbert and Lolita start this endless, repetitive quest through the USA, I was bored as hell. Oh yes, the writing, of course the writing is genius. But I am a lover of stories, and I love stories written in beautiful language, but language certainly cannot make up for a lack of story. Certainly not if it's about 250+ pages."
"1537",1536,"Felix Schweizer","might have been shocking, now it just seems bad"
"1539",1538,"Ivee","The storyline was interesting and different and kind of weird! When I first started reading it, it was great, the writing was really sarcastic and funny and although the plot was weird I still found myself beginning to like the main character - although he really is a psycho. But then after I was about mid way through I felt the story was dragging on a bit, and the complex sentences that Nabokov used were starting to really get on my nerves - he's the type of author who really likes to go into the most tremendous unnecessary detail on absolutely irrelevant things. And then I realised that I wasn't reading the book for fun, but just to get it over and done with and onto another book. It's kinda sad really, I just think Nabokov could've laid of the excessive adjectives."
"1541",1540,"Shauna","I almost quit reading this book about halfway through. I decided to finish, but still was skipping through some paragrahs and pages. I'm glad I finished, but still was not a favorite book, or one I would refer to my friends. I guess I just enjoy a happier (less pedophile) genre."
"1546",1545,"Stefania","Non si può dire che non sia un libro ben scritto. Quanto al contenuto... non sono una puritana ma mi ha fatta rabbrividire."
"1547",1546,"Stefanie","I have the controversial opinion that this book is super creepy. Revolutionary, I know. At first, the manic rantings of the Humpbert character were oddly fascinating. There's a definite poetry to them. But it builds and builds until it's just too much and over-pretentious sounding. I won't pretend that some of the writing wasn't oddly beautiful, but it got so creepy and hard to follow. And after maybe 2/3rds of the book, I didn't even want to follow it.In a weird way, this book is ""good."" It accomplishes what it sets out to accomplish, I think anyway. But unfortunately what it wants to accomplish involves a lot of terrifying paedophilia and nonsensical ramblings of a psychopath. I know it's a classic, but I wouldn't recommend it. "
"1548",1547,"Christopherseelie","Not what I expected. The Kubrick film (not his best work) ruined the plot-points for me, but that's hardly the reason one reads Nabokov. I found Humbert contemptable, and not because of the obvious repulsion. His arrogant narcisism made me wonder why I would spend an evening with this character, let alone 300 pages. Through his eyes, I don't ever quite feel like I know Lolita at all. She's lost in the arabesques of Humbert's posture.Nabokov shows technical grace in concieving this narrator. And there are a few true gems in the story's execution that evade conventional storytelling. But overall, I'm inclined to join the Nabokov-is-sterile-literature camp."
"1552",1551,"Yulenka","This was such a weird book for me. Not exactly the genre I tend to use. I found the story to be interesting, however the writing style was slightly frustrating at time. It felt like Nabokov took every sentence, and deep fried it in synonyms, adverbs, adjectives and casual asides. It was littered with vague references which I sometimes got, but who's presence made the book feel like I was wading through a swamp to get to the end of it. Story-wise, it was good but perhaps Humbert could have gone through the details and high points a little faster, the book felt a slow and was not a book that I couldn't bear putting down. (Took me so long to finish it!)However, the perspective was interesting if not unsettling. "
"1553",1552,"Ashleigh","I had HIGH expectations of this. I thought I was going to love it as much as I loved The Virgin Suicides. I thought it would have that same old world feel about it. Suffice it to say it did not deliver for me. I don't know whether its my fault for building it up in my head or if I am not intellectual enough to really understand the story but I hated Humbert. I absolutely got bored out of my skull reading his wittering, poncy language. And oh my god the French?!?! What a prize arse Humbert was. I mean what (other than infuriating the reader beyond repair) was the point in the ridiculous, arrogant fragments of French language? I for sure wasn't going to look up every one to see what the crap he was talking about. The whole thing for me just reeked of pretention and quite frankly he just seemed to think he was above everyone. (not the authors style but the character of Humbert which you cannot get away from as the narrator) I just did not care about him one bit. I don't think I have ever encountered a main character quite as loathsome as he was, and for that Nabokov deserves props. Lolita/Dolly was an interesting character and if the book had of been from her perspective I probably would have liked it. So in summary, I don't quite get it. I don't get the hype. I don't understand how everyone wasn't raging inside like I was by the time they finished. I felt like I missed the point of it all because of Humbert's bumbling and babbling. I feel the need to read more by this author but not just yet. This book left me feeling inadequate, unintelligent and bored out of my wits. I was so utterly thankful when I finally finished, then I read Nabokov's interview at the back and I was totally dumbfounded that I could have missed all these points he made. It feels a bit like I don't really know what I have read. And I will not be in a hurry to read it again."
"1554",1553,"K8","This book was not for me."
"1556",1555,"Agape","Can't understand why it's a classic. To me, it's more like a textbook for pedophile."
"1562",1561,"Jessica Bang","Almost three stars, only because the last third of the book really picked up with everything spiraling into madness. Overall, though, not quite my cup of tea. "
"1564",1563,"Jonathan Hiskes","Eh."
"1570",1569,"Cody Lakin","Oh, Lolita. It being the enduring and praised classic that it is, it feels strange to give it just two stars, but honestly, I'm writing this review from a purely personal standpoint, a reflection of my reaction to this book. So, disclaimer, I give it two stars and write this review not because it's a bad book, but because, personally, I could barely stand it, and reading it was kind of like torturing myself.One aspect that I appreciate, but what also makes this book what it is, is that it's actually told from the point of view of the pedophile. The main character, who I was at once disgusted by, and sometimes even felt bad for, is poetic and romanticizes things and is very much a weirdo, and the story, as you likely know, is centered around his uncontrollable love and lust for the twelve-year-old girl, Lolita. The story had its moments of humor, though those were mostly lost to me because there was very little I actually liked at all about the story, and at times you're even meant to feel bad for the main character, and I came close at one point, the shining moment of the story that I won't give away. However, atop the many aspects of the story and the idea that I strongly didn't like, this story is loaded with the most convenient moments of deus ex machina I've ever seen. Something's needed for the plot and for the main character to be able to proceed along a certain path that the story obviously wants to go? Sure: if the plot requires it, it's sure to happen. And at one event, a turning point in the story, the convenience of what happened was so overwhelming I almost set it down there and then, and maybe should have, leaving me thinking: This is the masterpiece people talk about when they talk about Nabokov? So, I appreciate the point of view, the writing, how different and how controversial it is, but at the same time, it was just too much for me.I picked this book up with the intent of expanding my literary horizons, and also because I knew little about it, little about Nabokov, and I couldn't decide between Chekhov and him, and sort of wish I'd gone with Chekhov. Lolita is very well written, needless to say, but it was just too gross and tasteless and overall bizarre, lacking in any sort of redeeming qualities, for me to stand behind. And I even love darkness in books, dark and sometimes disgusting things, but something about this book, probably how adamantly it seems to be justifying its own stance because of the first-person point of view, that threw me off."

"1580",1579,"Peter","“She was Lo, plain Lo, in the morning, standing four feet ten in one sock. She was Lola in slacks. She was Dolly at school. She was Dolores on the dotted line. But in my arms she was always Lolita.” Like the vast majority of the Western world I knew the basic story for this book but had never actually read it so felt that it was time to put that right. Sadly I was rather disappointed with it.The subject matter did not really bother me (despite having a daughter myself) as I'm not so naive to believe that pedophilia does not exist or always has nor do I believe in censorship. Anyway anyone opening this book and expecting salaciousness will be disappointed because although we know that sex goes on within it the actual act is never truly visible. The narrator tries to justify his actions and by suggestion that he did not have to drug Lolita, as he intended, before the first time that he abused her that she was somehow complicit in her downfall but as a reader we soon realize that he is not overly reliable.He endeavours to control Lolita ,by threats rather than physically force, to make her comply with his actions even going as far as using her to bring over 'nymphets' into their house for him to ogle but these are the words of the narrator rather than the author. Some regard this as a love story but personally I don't see it. Yes, Lolita is reliant on HH but I never felt that any love was reciprocated by her rather this is a novel about obsession. Lolita.Lolita speaks little throughout and always remains an enigma despite the book being named after her which is another clever ploy IMHO.Many reviewers regard this book as a modern classic and there is no doubt it is a remarkable book especially as it was written in English rather than the author's own first tongue. Also the fact that the narrator is also a pedophile and as such a anti-hero is quite remarkable.Now I'm sure that many will disagree with me but I actually enjoyed the first half of this book,despite or maybe because of the subject matter,but disliked the second half despite. The second half, as the narrator slips into madness,was just overly descriptive and therefore the plot became ponderous and it stretched credulity just too far for my taste with the seemingly pointless second road-trip.The cover blurb talks of dark humour within but personally I just didn't see it.But perhaps the worst part of this book for me was the constant addition of French phrases, after a while I just gave up looking for their translations. That said and done I'm glad that I've finally read it but whilst the imagery of the book will last the book itself will not. "
"1581",1580,"Pam Wright","Read it a long time ago and was not terribly impressed"
"1582",1581,"Oztinhix","Thirty-five percent through this book, I was unbelievably bored and in dire want to complete this book immediately. I trudged on, but the experience was sometimes painful. ""Oh my lovely Lolita""..yeah, ok, we get it. It didn't have to last that long....and let's throw in a description of Lolita playing tennis near the end, just for kicks."
"1584",1583,"Chia Shimin","Nabokov, is without a doubt, masterly and ingenious in prose. He whips up such delectable sundaes of literary expression. With all awareness of his brilliance though, the moralist in me can't help but shy away from the subject matter of paedophilia. ""Where are you hiding, Dolores Haze?Where are you hiding, darling?(I talk in a daze, I walk in a maze,I cannot get out, said the starling.)""This insane tragedy of abuse and twisted self-righteousness of the Humbug perpetrator leaves me thoroughly shaken at my moral roots. But lest Nabokov accuses me of being one of those ""gentle souls who would pronounce Lolita meaningless because it doesn't teach them anything"", let me clarify that Lolita has indeed been a splendid walk in an ethereal lingo park. And I have emerged sassier in diction. So it's all only a matter of preference that I am inclined to rate Lolita a measly 2 stars. "

"1589",1588,"Cara Brackstone","Two stars for clever and poetic writing. And perhaps insight into obsession and paranoia. No stars for anything else. The pace dragged needlessly as protagonist (or antagonist?) Humbert wanked on about pointless detail. Given that the reader can only really despise the main character, ""listening"" to his POV is grating and I was glad to put the book away. If sitting in a confined space with a sociopath who doesn't stop talking is your idea of a good time, you'll love this book. "

Apoi vine naratorul-personaj, Humbert Humbert, și din întâmplare, se cazează în locuința lor. O să plătească chirie. El știa dinainte că e pedofil. Fusese căsătorit și nefericit, o făcuse cu prostituate, câștigase bani-moștenire și fusese la sanatorii.El se îndrăgostește de Dolores Haze aka Lolita și și-o dorește doar pentru el. Își dorește ca maicăsa să moară... se căsătorește cu ea doar ca să poată fi mai apropiat de Lolita, în continuare în casa lor. Pe maicăsa o calcă mașina și Humbert o ia pe Lolita într-o călătorie foarte lungă cu mașina prin SUA. Fac mult sex. Asta durează un an și ceva. Apoi ea pur și simplu fuge cu un alt tip.Humbert crede că e fratele lui, dar apoi nu mai e nimic clar.Se enervează, suferă, stă singur ceva vreme... apoi primește o scrisoare de la ea, când Lolita are 17 ani. E gravidă, măritată și îi cere bani. Se duce la ea și îi dă 4000$ și ea nu vrea să vină cu el. Se duce la așa zisul răpitor și-l împușcă de mai multe ori până moare.Apoi teoretic e închis, dar partea asta nu e povestită... ci doar se exprimă între timp cu - onorată instanță -.Nu eram de acord cu oamenii care spuneau că Lolita e o simplă parașută, dar acum sunt.Și Humbert e doar un tip nașpa și vai de el și foarte plictisitor.Scenele de sex nu sunt descrise.Cartea ar fi putut avea cu ușurință 100 de pagini.Se plictisește veșnic și începe să admire natura... și o tot admiră și e groaznic.Și îmi amintește de cartea lu Vasile Rebreanu.O urăsc. Cred că filmele vor fi la fel de nasoale sau poate că nu...Toate speranțele-mi sunt năruite."
"1596",1595,"Stephanie Hanlon","Although this is quite possibly one of the most linguistically superior books I have ever read, I don't like it. I think Nobokov is a pompous asshole who thinks he is better than everyone else. I understand that for someone not native to the English language to perfect it as he did is quite an accomplishment. He does not, however, have to continuously insult the newness of America or the lack of, what he thinks to be, important knowledge among it's citizens. "
"1603",1602,"Isaac Timm","hmmmmm, it took me a while to read this, it runs a little long and the arc is fairly predictable, but this is how you write an unreliable narrator. I can see Lolita's merit in the modernist canon, but can't say I enjoyed it. "

I found the narrator to be sort of obnoxious on more than one occasion. I also found it a bit confusing many times and wasn't sure exactly what or who he was talking about. I've heard Humbert Humbert described as charming and I just don't see it that way. I found him to be rambly and obsessive but hardly charming. The pedophilia aspect was disturbing at times but not as jarringly as I thought it would be. It just seemed too outlandish to really accept. "

I felt as if Nabokov wrote this book with certain morbid goals in mind and I think that that was clear.

I have just read half of the book, which has evidently proved one thing: i (kinda) hate it. i despite the main character, i hate Lolita also, even though i know there, well, must be some deep meaning behind the lines, and though the way Nabokov depicts and describes things is incredibly graceful and sophisticated. well, meh."

"1671",1670,"Lily","Well played, Nabokov. Seems to me that Lolita is an excellent hoax created by a member of the literati for the literati. Nabokov effectively wrote a dreadfully boring and unnecessarily verbose ""erotic"" novel, mixing in enough fancy vocabulary and literary references to prove he's a smart cookie, and that extra dash of pedophilia/""incest"" to make it impossible to dislike the book without seeming dense and prudish.Welp, guess I'm just a Puritan blockhead. In the afterword to this edition, Nabokov makes a stink about people attempting to ""interpret"" the work, and also seems disgruntled with silly readers who, looking to be titillated, find themselves bored in the middle. If a book does not have a theme, an idea, even a character to think about, and it doesn't entertain, then it is utterly without point. Which seems to be the ""point"" of Lolita--to be without point. To be honest, I was told to read this book solely for the beautiful language, and for the first 20 pages or so, I did derive satisfaction from Nabokov's mastery of English. However, as the novel continues, the language grows muddy, the references and obscure words less illuminating to Humbert's unusual mind and more a reinforcement that nothing has changed--the book is still talking about a little girl getting raped in motels. Unbearably disgusting, painful, and boring, all at once. Grand.The one thing that saves this book from the one-star category is the ending. Anyone who has eaten a Warhead candy will know why. Warheads start off very, very sour, but then the sour wears off and the sweet that is left tastes exceptionally good. Lolita was like that--Humbert's entitlement, selfishness, and depravity are unbearable and spin out for hundreds of pages. But then, in a flash, he has a revelation--that he raped Dolores for years, completely depriving her of her childhood. Reading him admitting this crime is a breath of fresh air and almost makes it worth slogging through the rest.But I wouldn't really recommend it."
"1672",1671,"Gregg","The problem with this book: I already saw the Kubrick film. Thus it was impossible to not see James Mason when reading Humbert's somewhat laborious philosophizing of his own pedophilism, and it was impossible not to look for hints of Peter Sellers lurking in the background as Clare Quilty. The whole novel seems, to my jaded eye, much less controversial in today's climate, what with the Catholic priests' scandals, Spitzer's call girl and teenaged Dionysianism cavorting through the front pages and the halls of the average high school. So maybe I shouldn't have bothered with this one. But it's such a pop culture reference, I wasn't sure whether Humbert was supposed to be a sympathetic character, or a mesmerizing, seductive one: a middle-aged man in love with a twelve-year-old and stealing her life while remaining a slave to his own desire for her. Hmm. Tough one. I vote seductive. "

This isn't a love story but a book about a pedophile that becomes obsessed with one young girl. Humbert has a twisted way of thinking about love and considers how he feels toward this young Lolita to be love when it in fact is not.This was one of the most disturbing books I have ever read and really don't understand how someone can call it a love story, especially not the only convincing love story. If one is looking at it from the point of view of Humbert then yes it is a sick love story but in terms of the book overall it is not. Okay, I can see how some might say it is love in its cruelest or most vile form in terms of madness or his hallucination that what he feels is actually love when its all delusion. This was interesting in terms of perhaps getting inside the mind of a pedophile and seeing how they may twist relationship with a child and call it love but even that is stretching it. This book was just okay and I really don't recommend it. "

At times it was quite humorous and there were several beautiful passages, however I felt that the obsession of Lolita started to become monotonous. The descriptions lost their luster and the sentences became long-winded. Perhaps this is the reason why I dislike Charles Dickens. Oh and it comes in handy if you know some French as Nabokov likes to interpolate random phrases into the text. (Although I don't think that added any dimension or character, but that is debatable). "

I was reluctantly charmed by the plethora of literary allusions (most of which I couldn't even begin to comprehend). Filled with juxtaposition of beautiful language and disturbing deeds.(A descriptive passage):""By a paradox of pictorial thought, the average lowland North-American countryside had at first seemed to me something I accepted with a shock of amused recognition because of those painted oilclothes which were imported from America in the old days to be hung above washstands in Central-European nurseries, and which fascinated a drowsy child at bed time with the rustic green views theydepicted opaque curly trees, a barn, cattle, a brook, the dull white of vague orchards in bloom,and perhaps a stone fence or hills of greenish gouache. But gradually the models of thoseelementary rusticities became stranger and stranger to the eye, the nearer I came to know them.Beyond the tilled plain, beyond the toy roofs, there would be a slow suffusion of inutileloveliness, a low sun in a platinum haze with a warm, peeled-peach tinge pervading the upperedge of a two-dimensional, dove-gray cloud fusing with the distant amorous mist. There mightbe a line of spaced trees silhouetted against the horizon, and hot still noons above a wildernessof clover, and Claude Lorrain clouds inscribed remotely into misty azure with only their cumuluspart conspicuous against the neutral swoon of the background. Or again, it might be a stern ElGreco horizon, pregnant with inky rain, and a passing glimpse of some mummy-necked farmer,and all around alternating strips of quick-silverish water and harsh green corn, the wholearrangement opening like a fan, somewhere in Kansas."""
"1717",1716,"Adam Chawansky","This book started off intriguing, as it was clearly a first person account of his folly and foibles around a young girl dubbed Lolita. However, as the story dragged on, I found the story increasing dull. One, it uses a lot of French wordplay and literary allusions I didn't understand. Two, not much happens. For long stretches of the story you're exposed to a laundry list of places the characters visited without any real plot development. Three, by the time I was around 75% of the way through the book, I just didn't care what happened to Humbert or Lolita anymore."

Dull, But Not Without Redeeming Features
It took me two years to power my way through this one. I'm a stubborn reader that doesn't like to leave things half-read - but believe me it was reading for grim determination rather than pleasure from about the first third onwards.My heart sank when it then appeared on my uni reading lists and I had to go through the bugger again, but reading it again has given me a slightly higher appreciation of it.There are some powerful descriptions, some beautiful turns of phrase, not to mention the uncomfortable subject matter is what good literature should be tackling - showing things from unusual perspectives and humanising the monster.My problem starts when dear Humbert Humbert goes on the road, and just starts listing hotels and the most uninteresting details for hours at a stretch. At my university they argued that this was a deliberate move by Nabokov to demonstrate something about the narrator. Knowing Nabokov it probably was, but it still lost me - and putting your audience off is not a good move as far as I'm concerned.Plus the wet fart of an ending. I know dramatic things happened, but by that point it felt like we were watching the action through a spyglass. Somehow, when the plot gets the most dramatic, it all feels bizarrely removed.Again, I'm sure Nabokov meant it that way, and I'm sure it's terribly clever, but beyond the opening lines of the first chapter, it bored me to tears."

Humbert is forced to marry her mother Charlotte to stay in contact with the girl but a tragic accident will hand Humbert a chance to seduce his love.  I love the Jeremy Irons film and it was certainly closely based on the novel, unlike the original film. This book though was a bit of a long-winded waffle in that over-descriptive style that I just don't enjoy. There were some sections of good plot and flashes of humour, and parts of it were well written. I just got bored with the waffle in between."

I trudged on, however, never entirely coming to terms with listening in on a pedophile's inner thoughts but finding nonetheless certain parts and aspects of the book enjoyable.

The wordplay is undoubtedly clever and afforded a good deal of amusement for the first 100 pages or so. By the time HH and Lolita hit the road, I was bored out of my mind. The book in its entirety is about as thrilling as 'Symphony in Yellow' by Oscar Wilde. Speaking of Wilde, 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' accomplishes Nabokov's ideal of good fiction without suffering the reader hundreds of pages of veiled descriptions of a pedophile groping his stepdaughter. The end, and the blessed new plot developments it brought with it, afforded my aftertaste of the book some of its new cleverness, but it didn't veil the repetitive nature of the story and the language that was meant to carry the entire narrative.Modern Library ranked 'Lolita' the #4 greatest novel ever written in the English language, and my girlfriend, a brilliant critic herself, would place it at #1. I don't think I'll ever see what they do in A Book Entitled Lolita."

Lawrence and portrayed by Jerry Sandusky. For a while I thought that Nabokov had written the story to scare people into realizing the depth of evil that surrounds us, but in an afterword he claims that he actually wrote the story because he felt like writing it.The story is not a love story in the slightest. It has nothing but rape, molestation, psychological torture, and sociopathy, all serving no purpose.If this book hadn't been widely regarded as an essential classic, I'd have stopped reading within the first 20 pages. There is nothing beautiful or meaningful about this book; it is just awful, awful, awful."

Al fin y al cabo, libido y todo, era una niña. Entiendo por qué el libro escandalizó en su momento; si bien no es explícito, sí se sobreentiende el contenido sexual del mismo. El final me resultó un poco simple, pero igual fue una buena lectura."

No entanto, a sua escrita e a sua desenvoltura não foram suficientes para eu gostar da história - as longas descrições, a obsessão de Humbert e o enfado com que via o mundo à sua volta (apenas o mundo à sua volta porque o ""seu"" mundo era Lolita e essa de enfadonha nada tinha!) foram as situações que me afastaram do encanto do livro. Admito que Nabokov é um excelente escritor, rigoroso e inteligente mas, pessoalmente (e podem-me considerar o que vós bem entenderdes), isso não é tudo. Para um livro ser bom, na minha prespectiva, precisa de ser cativante, viciante, ficar a querer lê-lo até às quatro da madrugada quando tenho compromissos às oito da manhã, é querer ler mas ficar com pena quando chego ao fim, é relê-lo quatro e cinco vezes e, mesmo assim, achar aquele livro um bom amigo - e isso não aconteceu com esta história."

"1775",1774,"Diane Gihring","I think this is an interesting book to discuss in the context of Post-Modernism and the role of the narrator. I read this for grad school and the major question we discussed is whether or not the narrator is telling us the truth or is he presenting ""his"" truth to us, or is her purposefully misleading the reader. When I had that question to ponder when I was reading, then I became more interested in the book.Before the 20th century, the reader trusted the narrator implicity, but with all of the experiementation of Modernism and then the total distrust of all things during Post-Modernism, we can no longer trust the narrator implicitly to tell us the truth.But the subject matter is on the creepy side, an old man attracted to a young teen, and manipulating the situation so that they can be together. He plays mind games with her, molding her to be what he wants her to be. She manipulates him too.Definitely not a fun, feel good novel!If you are serious about the literary process, Post-Modernism, psychological mind games, then this book might be for you.And of course Sting mentions the author, Nabokov, in his song ""Don't stand so close to me"" so it is good to get the context of that line :)."
"1777",1776,"Camille McCarthy","A very well-written piece of trash, in my opinion. I was really grossed out by a lot of the descriptions and just the thought that he wrote this made me want to throw up. There were a lot of puns and the descriptions were full of clever wordplay but in the end the book wasn't even that exciting. The plot was pretty boring, really, after the first half when he is on his first trip around the US staying at motels with Lolita. After that it became pretty flat and even the climax at the end was so boring I almost fell asleep reading it. I don't understand how people can say this book is about love, because first off he treats Lolita like an object, not a real person with feelings, and second she hates him! Even the main character, Humbert Humbert, admits he ruined her childhood. It is not about love, it is about the disgusting sick urges of an entitled man who uses everyone around him to get what he wants. I quite enjoyed ""Pnin"" much more than this book, because the plot was engaging, the language was clever and full of puns, and the characters were interesting. It is sad that ""Lolita"" is Nabokov's most well-known work because it is not even very good compared to his other works. "

However, i still believe this book has potential in my future, i do want to re read it and put more effort in understand some of Humbert's explanations fro being so obsessive over nymphets, more specifically Lolita.

"1795",1794,"Nelleke","Ik kan me voorstellen dat dit boek het een en ander aan ophef had veroorzaakt toen het in de jaren 50 werd uitgebracht. Maar een boek over een controversieel onderwerp hoeft nog niet meteen een goed boek te zijn, ook al staat het vol met literaire hoogstaande zinnen. Bij het lezen van het voorwoord van Joost Zwagerman en Rudy Kousbroek had ik het al kunnen weten dat dit niet mijn type boek was. Dat zijn namelijk niet mijn type schrijvers. En dit boek is gewoon niet mijn type boek"
"1798",1797,"Kas Garza","okay, so I stopped reading 20 thousand leagues under the sea (again) because I just can't even (don't tell Clint I said that.)I am now reading Lolita and almost done with it. Now that I've got a blog, I realize I should probably make more time to read. BUT I'M SO BUSY. "
"1802",1801,"Meg Chee","Started out well but it got so boring that I barely read the ending."
"1803",1802,"Georgina Taylor","I didn't really enjoy this book, since I found the writing and metaphors that Nabokov had used very advanced and difficult. This book was definitely a stretch book. I choose it since I had heard a lot about it and it sounded interesting."
"1804",1803,"catalina","starts out good. the main character is neurotic and you have a natural drive to find out just how perverted and sicko he is...but then it takes way too long--and the character gets irritating. Never finished this book--if it don't provide put it to the side. "
"1806",1805,"Stephanie Adams","An interesting book, but way to disturbing."
"1809",1808,"Bindu","the description and the story told from the point of view of a ... [finding it difficult to get the right word!!] is good. There seems to be a need to classify the human species further into sub categories... depending on their modification in pheno-typical perception of the people in the world! "
"1816",1815,"Laurie Frazier","Had to read for college - not my favorite, although intriguing."
"1825",1824,"Jesse","You'll hear everyone else say this. That whole ""The subject was awful but it was so beautifully written."" I tend to agree. But was it a good book?Not so much. If you're looking to read something that makes you feel good, or something that expands your mind, or something that leaves you thinking, then find something else. I was impressed by the prose and have a lot of respect for the man who wrote it, I suppose, but I guess I don't get *why.*I've come to the conclusion that had anyone else written it, or had this not been written as lovingly as it was, then the reviews would plummet. It'd be ""just a story about some self-hating pedophile.""So if I can write a story about someone engaged in a romantic relationship with a tortoise, will it be accepted as long as I write it awesomely? Get outta here.Overall this book had its moments, but in the end it left a bad taste in my mouth. I didn't feel like I'd grown, or that I'd learned something. I didn't even feel ""more cultured"" or whatever because it was a book that everyone else read. I just felt kinda relieved that it was over."
"1826",1825,"Maťa","2,5/5Začiatok (povedzme necelých sto strán) bol úplne skvelý. Posledných cca 70 strán bolo fajn. Zvyšok bola nuda. Lolita mi liezla na nervy, ale Humbert ešte niekoľkonásobne viac. Proste časom ma strašne štval. Už len kvôli tej jeho príšernej žiarlivosti. Pozitívom je ale to, že autor píše naozaj veľmi dobre (čo ale nestačí), aj keď som sa miestami strácala. Je to ale škoda, do tejto knihy som vkladala obrovské nádeje, bola som na ňu naozaj zvedavá. "
"1827",1826,"Alle","Tenía muchas ganas de leerlo, tantas que tuve ánimos para intentarlo dos veces, ya que es lentísimo y a mi me aburría hasta extremos sedantes.En fin, una experiencia."
"1828",1827,"Vertigo","The prose is beautiful and seductive... so much so that I was two-thirds the way through the book before I realized what it was about and that I needed to put it down."
"1829",1828,"Delisa","I know everyone under the sun loves this book but it was just ok for me. Sorry, I'm not sorry."
"1830",1829,"Sashiko","The book sounded great in theory. It was recommended to me by a friend whose tastes are as dark and perverse as mine can be. But it was a huge disappointment. It's written well but the pace of the plot is incredibly slow. Humbert is a really boring person, despite not being quite normal."
"1831",1830,"erin","I felt like I needed to read Lolita before I started ""Reading Lolita in Tehran,"" but I just couldn't stomach it. Nabokov is an amazing writer (that's why two stars instead of one), and I'd like to read something else by him, but this book grossed me out too much to finish. I might have been able to read it when I was younger, before I'd thought much about the harm of societal and individual sexualization of young girls or worked closely with victims of people like Humbert, but at this point in my life it's not worth the time. "
"1833",1832,"Tempe","Chtěla jsem dát víc, opravdu chtěla. A nejen proto, že jsem se na tu knížku hrozně těšila, ale prostě nemůžu. Knížku, která by se mi tak špatně četla jsem už dlouho nedržela v ruce...http://tempina.blogspot.cz/2013/04/lo..."
"1834",1833,"Marvin Jared","I got through about 40% of the book and while the literary portions of the book were fantastic the concepts were a bit uneasy to read on. I am good with not continuing the book."
"1835",1834,"Yaply","I had to stop reading this because it was going somewhere where no man should ever go... and the book seemed to be loving every step of the way."
"1836",1835,"Rolly Stardust","Mah. Non è che mi abbia fatto impazzire. Lo stile è bellino, per carità, ma ci sono dei pezzi che ammetto di aver saltato a piè pari. Poi lui mi stava proprio sui marshmallow. Aiuto."
"1837",1836,"Sigita Zvejniece","Man ""Lolita"" nepatika. Vai drīzāk - man nepatika ideja par Lolitu. Par to, ka tāda būtne vispār eksistē. Es izlasīju šo grāmatu, jo, nu, visu cieņu autoram un valodai, bet es laikam esmu pārāk... šauri-redzoša, ja runa ir par literatūru, un man šķiet, ir daži stāsti, kuriem nevajadzētu būt uzrakstītiem. Lolita, manuprāt, varēja palikt viens no tiem."
"1839",1838,"Rachel Christlieb","Way too much description for me. Also, it has a very disturbing plot."
"1842",1841,"Jesús Valls","Too slow, you have to read it, but it will not be on your favorite ones."
"1843",1842,"Brendan Greenaway","Boring."
"1844",1843,"beyondbothered","I found this to be a bit boring."
"1847",1846,"Man O'neal","WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS: For me this book started off very good. It was compelling, engaging and sprinkled with patches of beautiful language here and there. It's about a middle aged man (Humbert) who is controleld by an obessesive lust for pre pubescent girls. When he first lays eyes on the young Dolores Haze ,whom he names Lolita, this passionate yearning which has always perculated inside him becomes too much to ignore; he must have her. But under the watchful eye of Mrs. Haze and a close knit suburban community this is no easy task. The operation requires great tact and subtlety. Now, the story of this operation and it's development is wonderful. I enjoyed every page of it anticipating Humbert's next move and his eventual capture of the enchanting ""nymphet"". Sadly, once the seduction was complete and Humbert had claimed his victory about half way through, the book took a serious turn for the worse. It dragged on with boring recounts of mundane events and became difficult for me to follow as an uninterested reader. In short, once he makes Lolita his lover nothing even close to the gripping awfulness of quiet pedophilia occurs for the second part of Nabokov's story."
"1848",1847,"Nadz HA","I feel like abandoning the book by the time I reached the 2nd part. Still, it was beautifully written. Maybe paedophilic theme doesn't interest me that much."
"1850",1849,"Sampada Wagde","Too much of French and references to other literary works obscured my understanding of the book...however, the philosophies and human nature's depiction was wonderful...writing style was a bit different and matter-of-fact."
"1852",1851,"Apolline","Definitely not for everybody."
