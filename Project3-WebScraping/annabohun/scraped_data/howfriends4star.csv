"2",1,"Leah","4.5 stars. Excellent read. Very much a product of its time and yet shockingly contemporary. Made me feel like the 1930s were closer to today's way of thinking than the post-war era. He was extremely open minded on many topics, from religion to work. Enjoyable hearing old time stories of FDR, Lincoln, Franklin and many more. Great ideas for getting along in the world with more joy and less trouble. My main criticisms are: 1) his treatment of gender and 2) his theory of change. On gender, the book is full of stories of sexual harassment in the workplace and mansplaining. That's agitating. Second, I don't think Dale Carnegie has any conception of the struggle to change society, particularly as a white privileged man. Society just worked for him. For blacks and other minorities, for women, for gay people, the world is full of bias and prejudice. How best to handle this? Often, I think Carnegie's approach is correct. You can catch more flies with honey. But other times, I think we should consider our theories of how change happens, and recognize that struggle, criticism and resistance are necessary. In short, very thought provoking and fun read. Especially the old-timey audiobook reader. Highly recommended! I'm surprised to say that! But it's a fun book, full of wisdom. And it's less about manipulation than kindness, understanding, listening and taking others' perspective into account. "
"3",2,"Burak","It's a good book that include useful tips for influence people. Also has lots of influential and memorable quotes in it and easy-to-read."
"4",3,"Trevor Kidd","My grandfather, the most affable person I've ever met, swore by Dale Carnegie's books. This is the first that I have read and I find it to be quite helpful. Sometimes I refer to parts of it to remind myself to apply them in my daily life. The title may sounds pretentious, or like something only a salesperson or politician would read, but it's really helpful just for how a person interacts with other people. I have had problems with social anxiety, and I find that thinking about some of Carnegie's methods helps me handle social situations by concentrating on being genuinely interested in what people have to say rather than how awkward I feel.Bottom Line: How to Win Friends and Influence People can help pretty much anyone interact with his or her peers more effectively."
"5",4,"Kiki Unhinged","I have this audio book and yes, you CAN have the jobs you want!"
"6",5,"Brendon Hertz","I read this after a friend said he had read it and said what was written was fairly self-explanatory. Yes, it is self-explanatory for some people, and yes, some of the book seems to be outdated, but overall, the principles conveyed and backed up with examples are good tenets for anyone to have a refresher on: be kind, and others will be kind to you. We all have our struggles. Let's remember that."
"11",10,"Ahmad Hafez","One of the early ""How-to's"" Good bookمن أقدم وألطف كتب المساعدة الذاتية "
"12",11,"Anuj Mag","Went through this book again (audio book). Honestly, didnt like it as much as i liked when i first read it. But it reinforced one fact- the basics of dealing with humans wont drastically change- no matter how much technology invades our lives."
"15",14,"Jonatan Billiau","No earth shattering new insights, but a good collection of tips. Everybody will definitely learn at least one thing from this book. The fast smooth narrative and unique anecdotes explain why this book has stood the test of time."
"18",17,"Mitchell Bouley","Dale Carnegie provides a practical guide to speak and to influence people by developing your speaking skills. Who does not want to develop? Who does not want to be influential? Neither do I. This is not only a personal development book, but will help you as well when you want to improve your abilities as a business person. I did like this book very well, and it will help me very well to develop myself in business life and personal life. I am glad that revisions were made to fit the current world, and I will probably read this book again in the upcoming few months!"
"19",18,"Cyrus Molavi","I finally read it. Probably one of the most influential business books. I can see why it lives on. It's packed with actual tips for how to be liked and listened to--and who doesn't want that? It's nice that each tip is brought to life with a few cases, but there's a whole lot of movie magic happening in these scenarios: the antagonist always says and reacts in exactly the right way to create an outcome. The value nevertheless is provided in the reveal of these techniques. The bonus comes that they're productive to society on the whole. The catch is that the way that they're applied is the only thing that matters; and genuinely, tactfully, effectively employing them is much easier said than done. Important read, though. "
"20",19,"Anand Kumar","Amazing book and provides insight on how to look from others perspective.This will stand as one of the best book for me and will refer it in between."
"21",20,"Thomas","In some ways, the material in this book is dated; however, the underlying message is timeless: It's the golden rule--treat others as you would want to be treated.You may want to be less verbose in how you execute the principles presented, but the advice is still sound."
"22",21,"Mooncalf","It's a better book than most self help books. This book is relatively bullshit free and suggests techniques that are less manipulative than other self help books. I wouldn't call it well researched and while there are historical and personal examples it does not reference proper studies. The book sets outs the points that it makes in a useful manner. The book is rather readable and relevant dispite having been written in 1936 and since it is a classic you will at least be getting some cultural knowledge out of reading it."
"23",22,"Watson Ndethi","A must-read. Highly Recommended.Become a master of tact and diplomacy.The purpose of education is not to know but to do, said a scholar. Now if you read this and do, you will win friends and influence people."
"24",23,"Rejni","I enjoyed this book thoroughly, and let me put it this way. I spend the past decade educating myself, completing a masters degree, working hard, reading, engaging in heavy discussions. When I started school and work, I remember thinking with my intellect, I want to bring about a change in the world. NOTHING WORKED!! I could have all the knowledge and the drive in this world to want to make a difference but without the fundamental knowledge on how to work with people, how to influence others and work effectively through arguments, I realized I will not succeed. This book and the contents therein, challenged my goals and my rationale. I plan to refocus my energy on capping and harnessing the energy of most invaluable asset of all- people. A book I would highly recommend! "
"25",24,"Erin Nudi","It's funny how this book was published in 1936, but human nature hasn't changed. This book was well written and well organized, although I think I would have gotten more out of it was more modern, with more recent examples of people who were great with people (other than Lincoln and Rockefeller). But, it was written when it was written."
"26",25,"Malaika","Good, common sense..."
"28",27,"Sugan","Nice read. I never thought a book wrote in 1930's will be of relevance now. But Dale Carnegie proved it.The only problem I found was, book has a lot of examples for each topic and most of the examples revolve around American history and american business men."
"30",29,"Dinesh V","A good business book. It's lessons are relevant even today. If you're a new manager learning the ropes this book should help. "
"31",30,"Bob Pearson","This is an easy book to discount. There is the slogan that the title has become. Many of the examples seem outdated at first, from the early 20th century, and the narrative sounds naive in today's highly skeptical social atmosphere. In addition, the lessons seem somewhat simple. I bought this book on a whim while I was browsing through a bookstore in the Hasidic neighborhood while vacationing in Brooklyn, curious about what the locals would be reading. So more just to see what happened than not, I decided to start trying to apply some of the advice Carnegie was offering up. I was amazed to see that these bits of advice actually did work. I realized that much of this I actually already knew but didn't want to apply because I thought those ideas were beneath me. So long after he wrote the book despite its outmoded style and examples, it's a great read and a great guide to dealing well with people. I'm glad I succumbed to the whim and now I'll use these lessons for all my life. "
"32",31,"Leanne","Classic - I keep retreading it"
"33",32,"Hydrogeen  Shahinoviç","كُتب لكل مدب !"
"34",33,"Mitch","Only con is the repetitiveness !"
"36",35,"Steve Habina","This book was really highly reviewed and has been in print for like 80 years. However I feel that some of its age is beginning to show. There are times when I'm not sure if the author is trying to get a point across or trying to sell some sort of cure-all from 100 years ago 'Listen to what my friend John Smith from Springfield, MO said about my course!' and like phrases that are often said. His points are well illustrated and provides good examples though. It's a decent book, but shows its age. Worth a read if you want to actually win friends and influence people."
"37",36,"Khulood","I was hesitant at first, but I'm glad I read it! I think this book is brilliant. Sometimes you actually forget that this book was published in the 30s because many (if not all) of the points apply to the current day, especially in the work place. I've read a review that says the book teaches you how to be manipulative, but I don't think it does. A lot of the points reminds us that wherever you are, you are dealing with people, and politeness goes a long long way. When you've been working a long time, you see people being impolite (and rude) in the name of familiarity. It may not be the boo for everyone, but as a reader, I think it is a good read. "
"39",38,"Yurasawa","Vraiment un grand livre de M. Carnegie.je l'ai entendu pendant un voyage de 3 heures, Ce livre peut changer entièrement ta vie.un petit résumé : "" Pour se faire des amis, influencer les autres et les gagner à notre cause, il est important de savoir ménager leur égo ; ceci passe par un changement important dans notre comportement de tous les jours, qui consiste à ne plus critiquer, à s’intéresser réellement aux autres, à sourire, à retenir le prénom de notre interlocuteur, à leur faire sentir leur importance, à ne jamais leur dire qu’ils ont tort, à parler de nos erreurs avant de parler des leurs, à motiver, à complimenter sincèrement, et de manière générale, à toujours ménager leur amour-propre. "" "
"40",39,"Michael D","A Classic!! I should probably read this again.. it's been a while ;] "
"41",40,"Lane Sawyer","This is a book I've been slowly processing for the better part of a year now. The ideas it contains are simple, and it all basically boils down to ""be nice, see things other people's way, and then exploit what they want"".At times I felt like the techniques were almost a little dirty, given that Carnegie is essentially asking everyone to exploit the human psyche. For example, rather than address a problem directly, you are supposed to butter up the other person, make them feel important, bow to their every need, and then they'll do what you want. I guess you can't argue with the results, but some of the things in the book just felt icky.That said, the book contains good advice on what makes people tick and gives good ideas on how to make people like you. It's a good read that will add one more feather in your cap to help you navigate your job, your friends, and your family relationships."
"42",41,"Aaron Bolin","Still good advice decades after it was written. It would be interesting to see the family tree of self-help books; I'd bet that this little book (a quick read) is near the root."
"45",44,"Jacob Standard","Each chapter has interesting stories and lessons from history about how men and women have been successful in life and business. (A lot of the stories are from Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt, who are 2 of my favorite men of history). In each chapter, Carnegie drives home a simple point that would be useful in day to day interactions. Some of the points are as simple as being genuinely happy about seeing people and seeking to avoid arguments at all costs. That being said, none of the author's points are mind-blowing in themselves; however, I found it quite useful to see how I can improve in my relations with others. I would certainly recommend this book to any of my friends. You have nothing to lose and a whole lot to gain by reading this book."
"48",47,"Tuanking","It's a good book,maybe it's helpful for my future.I enjoy this book very much,even if I'm not good at English.This book has a lot of examples,so sometimes I can't completely understand them.I think I should read it again after several months."
"49",48,"Matt Weisel","A lot of good insights here. I feel like we do a lot of these things in the modern work place anyhow, but these techniques probably originated from this book."
"50",49,"Lenny Rustian","I love it, I'll read it more and more"
"51",50,"Madyson","Wow, so I bought this book used and it is a version from 1964. I found it incredibly interesting to read in that all of the examples are very outdated and honestly, the book needs feminism. But that being said! After 1981, two sections were removed, on writing business letters and rules for making your home life happier (the latter being almost horrifying to read, being a young female growing up in the 21st century). Also, updated examples were published after 1981 (I'm getting this from Wikipedia..soo)Fundamentally, most of the advice and general points in the book are great, and I may reread the newer version in the future. Reading this version was like looking in a time machine!"

"53",52,"Heliocentric","An insightful book with very useful tips and short case studies which apply the tips. However, I felt that the tips given throughout were largely similar and simply reworded - most of them essentially boil down to understanding and empathising with people."
"56",55,"Ko Matsuo","This book has consistently been on best business books to read list. It's a good read. Some tactics seem a little sale-ish (""get the other person to say 'yes', ""talk in terms of the other persons interest""), while some are timeless (""dramatize your ideas"" and ""let the other person save face""). Easy read. Fantastic that this book published in 1938 still has legs."
"60",59,"Andrew Westlund","Amazing how this book has withstood the test of time. On occasion, reading anecdote after anecdote got to be a bit much, but I found myself really relating to some of the examples, too. "

"80",79,"Tom Schulte","Well, allow me to be ""hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise"" for this sage tome. It strikes me as exciting, wise, and wonferful as the first time I read it. Following Carnegies advice, I probably should refer to it more often. I'll keep this copy at hand. Hopefully, that'll help me find the courage to live this way."
"81",80,"Jason  Everaert","I think that this book is the accumulation of Dale Carnegie's lectures. The way that it is written is him making a claim and applying stories and multiple situations to support it.The priority in effective communication is outstanding, rather then a simple ""Do This"" it is more a pause and think book. Trying to apply the situations to one's own life. Working on communication and human sciences, Dale calls upon his experience to help those who want to improve personal and business interactions.I think that rather then reading it monthly as suggested, Ill read it again to start 2017"

"105",104,"Liv","Interesting book; Carnegie ties psychology with his own experience and the experience of members of his classes. This book is very repetitive, which whilst is a little tedious, means that the ideas introduced start to sink in. Every idea proposed is elegantly linked with plenty of examples showing the reader how to use the ""principles"" in practice. Overall a good book that will give the reader something to think about when faced with new social interactions."
"107",106,"Bruno","It is emblematic of a man, dale Carnegie, and America at that time."
"112",111,"J.D. DeLemont","This is such a hopeful little book. At some point in your life, someone who is trying to seem nice while actually acting superior will hand you this book. They will tell you that you absolutely have to read it and it will change your life. So you will. What you will find is a really nice, optimistic take on the world from a guy who just generally had a good attitude. You will not see the underlying white and male privilege, but it is there. None of the things that happened to the author would have happened if he was, say, a black female. And yet, it is uplifting and really a good read if you ignore the obvious flaws. "
"114",113,"Jordan","A book that contrary to its title, encourages people to be less manipulative, more genuine and positive in nature. Carnegie relates his golden nuggets of wisdom through telling real-world stories of people in everyday situations. I feel that his 12 principles say it all.1. The only way to win an argument is to avoid one2. Show respect for the other persons opinion, never say ""you are wrong""3. If you are wrong admit it quickly and emphatically4. Begin in a friendly way5. Get the other person saying ""yes yes"" immediately6. Get the other person to do a great deal of talking7. Let the other person feel that the idea is their own8. Try honestly to see from the other persons point of view9. Be sympathetic with the other persons ideas and desires10. Appeal to the nobler motives11. Dramatize your ideas12. Throw down a challenge On being a leader:1 Begin with praise and honest appreciation2. Call attention to people's mistakes indirectly3. Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing others4. Ask questions instead of giving direct orders5. Let the other person save face6. Be lavish in your praise7. Give the person a fine reputation to live up to8. Make the fault seem easy to correct9. Make the person happy about doing the thing you suggest"
"115",114,"Miranda","I appreciate universal truths and this book is full of them. I didn't love the 'used car salesman' feel of this book, but I found the principles spot-on. I underlined throughout while reading it and I will review this book regularly as I live my life. How precious the pearls of wisdom are that Carnegie shares here!"
"119",118,"Renee","If you have regular contact with human beings, you should read this. "
"120",119,"Lyndsey","This was my favorite book when I was younger... Lots of needed tips for this girl:) It reminds me how to better implement true principle, namely appreciating and loving people for who they are and showing that they are important through your actions. Upon the revisit this time around, I still liked it well enough and learned new things that correlated with this stage of my life. I must warn, however, that I got equally bored towards the end, and ended up tuning most of it out. Which is a shame. I will have to revisit the end again after a break. "

This was required reading for a business class I'm taking and I was dragging my feet, not wanting to struggle through another dry and boring book. This is anything but dry and boring.Honestly, I could have used this book at the beginning of the semester. Working in a team of 5 to complete a semester long project has been rough. Some people don't care about doing half-assed work and will gladly accept a C while others just didn't bother to show up to team meeting. I could have used Dale Carnegie's wisdom during this process.

"149",148,"Nazrul Buang","Just finished reading ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" (2006) by Dale Carnegie. Perhaps the most well-known self-help book of all time, I decided to borrow it and understand Carnegie's most popular book that serves as influence for many other modern self-help books.If the book's contents seem familiar, it's because the book was originally written back in 1936. Carnegie's book details the basic skills of communication that are common sense in terms of dealing with people, yet are underutilised by many people. His words of wisdom are simplistic, and he preaches values of empathy, humility, patience and understanding so that readers can become better people.The lessons in the book are backed up purely by anecdotes that the author has personally heard from the people he has come across during his lifetime. More story-based than scientific, his writing style reflects the kind of person Carnegie is: a hardworking boy from Missouri who experienced many failures and setbacks in his career, but had a knack for public speaking and soon got his huge break and became the most influential self-help coach of all time.Though the contents and writing style are understandably dated, his lessons are anything but obsolete. They serve as timeless morals that everyone can benefit and learn to apply in daily life. I thank the man who perhaps would not understand the sheer importance of his own book even to this day.NEXT BOOK: ""The Art of Work"" (2015) by Jeff Goins."

"169",168,"Pratap Palthady","A timeless book. Read it for the first time when I was 15 after my father recommended it. The examples are great and the advices are relevant to this date."
"170",169,"Kimberlli","This is definitely a must read. Even if you don't feel like you actually need this type of advice. It will give insight into people's behaviour and it will also help see if you're doing something that is setting you back, because you might be doing it without intending to. A lot of things might seem obvious, but it is the type of stuff one usually overlooks in everyday life. And it won't hurt to keep these rules in mind."
"172",171,"Will Gregory","The techniques in this book honestly work. there are plenty of stories that show examples of when and how the techniques presented in this book work. there are also a plethora of inspirational quotes. good for anyone, from a college student, to a busy mother. this book really gets you to understand people better and helps you interact in ways that will be to your advantage."
"174",173,"Susie","I finally read this book cover to cover, even though it has been sitting on our shelves for years & I have skimmed through it a few times. It was worth the read. In fact, I've decided I need to read it about once a year.The title sounds like it's a book on how to manipulate people, and since it was originally published in 1937, it is terribly dated in an interesting sort of way. However, the principles are fantastic - basically the Golden Rule broken down into subcategories with dozens of real-life examples that made me sit back, think about how I interact with people, and decide to consciously make some changes.In fact, since reading it, I've made an effort to change my reactions/interactions with my kids and all the people I have had to interact with as a result of moving (moving truck drivers, cable installer, lots of customer service reps, etc.). It's been refreshing and enlightening. Not that I was a beast before, but we can all get in the habit of sometimes letting our frustrations get in the way of treating people with the respect and consideration we all deserve. You'll see what I mean when you read the book."
"177",176,"William","Despite what some reviewers might have you think, this book is not about flattering people with fake platitudes so you can puff up their self-esteem and take advantage of them for personal gain. I've seen a few reviews that state this and it's obvious that they either didn't read the entire book or they only skimmed it. Dale points out multiple times in multiple chapters that the intent of his book isn't to have people flattering others with false praise. If you missed that, it is your fault, not his. As for my review: This is a relatively useful book. Some of the information was common sense to me (don't interrupt people while they're talking), but some of the tidbits were very useful for navigating the workplace as well as ""civilian"" life. Simple things like making others feel important for their contributions are easily forgotten nowadays, it seems. This book (albeit with the information properly condensed and the examples made age appropriate) would be fantastic for children in younger grades because it teaches you how to listen to others, to respect what they're saying and to expect the same in return. In a perfect world, you would expect parents to teach these types of life skills, but that isn't always the case. I'm sure I'll re-read this book a few times (though I highlighted particularly useful information), but I'm still docking a star because, at least for me, some of the chapters fell flat due to it being common sense to me. But that's just my personal opinion, obviously. You may get more or less use out of it. I suggest you check it out for yourself, though."
"179",178,"ishwhe","I bought & read this book when I was in China, as it was one of a couple ""classics"" that were readily available in English. I picked this book up because I loved the movie ""How to Lose Friends and Influence People"" and thought this book was based on that... (Kindly excuse ma ignance.)Since I had no clue what this book was about, I didn't know what type of book it was. At first I thought maybe it was a farce, that this was a parody or something, because... I don't know, it seemed so cliche? But then I got really into it and started thinking Dale Carnegie was a genius! I could use these methods in my life! I even started trying to memorize rules in my head to use for the future. On top of that, I remember thinking it was an amusing read, and I liked hearing all the little stories.I need to reread it. I forget all the tips. They were basically ""Be a genuinely nice person to others"", right? haha."

There are a few reasons why it can be able to catch my interests :1. It stated clearly in each point. 2. It contains many practical examples of famous people during his time.3. It summarizes what it has described into an easy-glance.It is highly recommended to whomever wants to know about self-belief, self-confidence and simple steps to make friends."
"192",191,"Jonathan Rodebaugh","This was an interesting read. I believe a more accurate title would be ""How to manipulate people to get what you want while looking like a good person."" There are some good advice about how to mitigate arguments, work together and advance, however this is one of those books that can give perceived power to the wrong people. Manipulation can and is a very serious issue and this book gives you the keys on how to manipulate situations to your favor. That isn't a real honest position and can ultimately hurt those you love the most. "

"221",220,"Natasha","'How to Win Friends and Influence People' was the first book recommended to read as part of my Animation degree as so much of our work is done in teams and therefore requires good people relations and the ability to share/sell ideas. For this purpose, I felt that Carnegie did a good job and left me with a lot to ponder on! Carnegie uses lots of anecdotes to help explain and memorize the teachings and the summaries at the end of each section also make the book easier to recap. I'd say the core message in this book is (at the risk of over simplification): treat people kindly and respectfully and they're more likely to listen to what you have to say without adversity. Be humble and patient. "
"223",222,"Pvw","First published in 1937, this still is a classic that surpasses the thousands of other books that have afterwards been published about maintaining successful relations with other people.Although you can feel the 'American Dream' lingering in the background, and even if the fascination of Carnegie for presidents and industrial tycoons feels like an odd choice to a present day reading public, that doesn't take away that the simple principles Carnegie expands are still valid today.Want some basic ones?1) Refrain from complaints or criticism, judge no one2) Show your appreciation, be honest and straightforward3) Instill people with a desire to do or want somethingAs for conversations, the book boils down to: don't be self-centered, stop babbling about yourself and show genuine interest in other people.Carnegie explains all his ideas in a engaging manner and illustrates them with loads of examples or anecdotes.The funniest thing to do with this book is: trying it out!If you apply only a few of the ideas on the people around you, either familiar or new acquaintances, the result is astonishing. Friends visit you more often, total strangers poor their heart out (without being drunk and in a bar) and everybody seems to think you're the nicest person on earth.Thank you for reading this, I really appreciate the time you gave my review. ;-)"
"226",225,"Megan Marie","I'm not a fan of the title of this book...But, I find that there are many topics within these pages that focus our thoughts, actions, and words on being an encouraging friend and person of influence to the people you are around.  ""Being encouraging requires a special attitude. When you look at another person, rather than seeing her faults, you need to be able to see her strengths and possibilities, what she is capable of."" ""Many of us don't take the time to consider what actually motivates people."" p.211 I found this book written to the business audience but I believe teachers, parents, and anyone looking to be a supporting friend can find examples of great moments leaders led others to believe in themselves, something we all should strive to impart in others. :)"

"229",228,"Cody","Takes the golden rule and endeavors to provide a book of case studies that support it. Whether we are religious or just an average layman, the human flesh has its biases. We crave attention, we want to feel validated, and if you are ever wise enough to acknowledge the human bias within yourself then you will be perceptive enough to possibly exploit that in others. And... This book beat the alternative. Imagine having Mr. Burns as a boss. "

"239",238,"Lance Hartland","This book has been criticized for being a “sycophants-in-training” manual. I happen to agree, but the author tosses in a disclaimer that admonishes readers that his “cracker-barrel idioms” (principles) are not maxims. In fact, the book encourages a trial and error method with his advice and to discard it, if need be. I decided to read this book with a mindset of trying to find some information on how to improve my social interactions with people or to realize when another person is using a manipulative tactic on me. I find this book validated many aspects of social intelligence that I was already aware of, but, none-the-less, there were various anecdotal stories that kept me entertained, whether they were true or not. Here are some takeaways: “Give a person a fine reputation to live up to”. Example: If you are reliant upon a friend’s loyalty, express how you appreciate their loyalty and that you would gamble the house that their loyalty won’t become perfidious. This may or may not cause that person to evaluate how important their pseudo-reputation is before proving themselves to be disloyal, but at least there is potential for a slight advantage of influence to maintain his or her loyalty. When encountering an argument, don’t reverberate back a harsh tone. Most likely, you won’t inspire rationality and open-mindedness when you are deluged in anger. If you have trouble with insubordination amongst your employees, try praising any slight improvements, criticize indirectly, phrase a command within a question (can you do this for me?), lead by example, or invoke a competitive spirit between peer groups. There are many tools the author suggests for this dilemma. Everybody has self-importance. Nobody wants to feel like their life is inconsequential. PRINCIPLE 1: Become genuinely interested in other people. PRINCIPLE 2: SmilePRINCIPLE 3: Remember that a person’s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language. PRINCIPLE 4: Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves. PRINCIPLE 5: Talk in terms of the other person’s interests. PRINCIPLE 6: Make the other person feel important–and do it sincerely. "
"244",243,"Vinoth Srinivasan","It conveys a simple message to win or to attract or to befriend others..Respect them in a gentle and polite manner genuinely, so that you get what you want from them in the same manner.

"263",262,"Andie","Book Club Read"
"265",264,"Islam Mohamed","The book is an all-containing bible of all psychology and people-treating tactics gained over the human experiences.It contains everything related to interpersonal skills; Friends, workmates, subordinates and even family.The thing which shocked me is that this book is dated back to the 20s of the last century, and that means that the human development sciences are not a NEW focus, aren't they?"
"267",266,"Rashid Lahha","This book will make you better talker with family,friends, people, and business "
"271",270,"Velinda Peyton","I learned so much about how to treat people. Basically we all know this if we think about how we want to be treated. We lose site of this with other people and this book helps to bring that back to light."
"275",274,"Kelly Winger","Found a very old edition, signed to my grandfather from Dale Carnegie. Solid advice."
"276",275,"A S Moser","This is the best self-improvement book I've read. While that's admittedly a small sample size, I have read enough to know that I generally do not like the genre. This, however, was a lot of fun. Carnegie clearly knows what he's talking about, and practices what he preaches. Plus his narrative approach is refreshing after the overload of superlatives and unlocked secrets found among contemporary writers of these types of books. I definitely recommend this short volume."
"277",276,"Mohamed Mohamed","How to Win Friends and Influence People, by Dale Carnegie, is about how to be a better person in yourself and help other people. As this book talks about a lot of things that the author has encountered in his life, he also talks about the other side of things, and most importantly, how to get what you want. By getting what you want, you also help other people along the way. At the end of the day, you can benefit from your own well being and also help others.The main problem that drives this story is a big problem. This problem is getting what you want. For the author, this was a struggle during his younger years. So he later devised a set of principles that have successfully worked for him and drove him towards the common good. These sets of principles are the resolution to this problem, as it winds down from the confusing maze of human psychology into simple words.This boo was entertaining for multiple reasons. First, the author talks about the mistakes that he made, which later led to not get what he wants. Second, after revealing his mistakes, he later tells us what he did to turn his mistakes around to successfully get what he wants for the benefit of everyone. The only downside to this book is its setting. In order not to spoil you, this book is very amazing and well written.At the end of the day, I would recommend this book to everyone. This book is for people who need a boost in their life and for those who want to improve their relationship in life. It benefits everyone, so take advantage and read this book ASAP!"
"280",279,"Lain","Very practical methodologies.However, they are mostly surface issues. The book doesn't address the fundamental issues/principles underlying those methodologies."
"281",280,"Anne","This one has been recommended to me for years, but I didn't expect to like it as much as I did. It really is full of timeless advice about how to lead well, whether you are a mom or a CEO. As an added bonus, the guy who reads the audiobook is a perfect fit."
"285",284,"Chenri Jano","Title is misleading, with manipulative tone when i first read the title but its worthwhile especially if you find yourself wanting to fix or upgrade your social skill"
"289",288,"Alyssa Siefert","(I actually read the hardcover). Good tips, a favorite of my father, but I'm still working on winning some friends..."
"290",289,"Synthia","Simple, common-sensical advice that can be summed up in two words: be nice. It is full of the common knowledge and popular wisdom that permeates our daily lives yet we fail to thoroughly engage in. Like any other good work of literature the book is timeless. Granted, some of the anecdotes are dated (telegraph much?) but easily adaptable to the present. I have added the book to my ever growing list of ""books that will help me become a better person""."
"293",292,"Cooper Lord","Even thought his book was written in 1936, it contains lessons that are important for everyone to learn. I have picked up a few pointers in how to improve my relationships with people, and hopefully I'll be able to create some good habits."
"294",293,"Francine","Over the decades I have read this one at least 3 times...this time I went through it quickly as a refresher. This book has something to share with each revisit.You should read this, really."
"295",294,"Trish Voldeng","Good life stradegies."
"298",297,"Shiva Vallur","For people looking to hone their communication skills , this book arguably can be called the Holy Grail.The principles mentioned by Dale Carnegie for effectively dealing with people are spot on and all of them have passed the test of time with flying colors and still hold true today.Most of them are simple and can be translated into real life with little efforts while a few of them demand painstaking efforts to implement.Overall , the book affords an amazing insight into people's behavior.The book is laden with illustrations from Dale Carnegie's life and other great personalities such as Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Andrew Carnegie and so on who have harnessed these principles in their lives successfully. Though these illustrations date back to the early 1900's , they very much resemble the type of situations that people run into in their modern day lives.The ideas are constructed with simple and lucid words enabling us to make the best of each and every one of them.This is not a type of book that you put aside once you read it.If your intentions are to take advantage of the principles mentioned in the book and to be an effective communicator, then this dictates revisiting the concepts in the book every now and then and incessantly practicing them in real life.It puzzles to know that such an incredible book is not incorporated as a text book in our academic education and in modern times I think it is a must-read for everyone.It definitely serves as a perfect guide toward having a sound and healthy professional life as well as an equally good personal life."
"300",299,"Y. L","I picked this book up at the local library just because I've heard so much about Dale Carnegie. The first few pages of this book tries to sell itself, with the last few pages being a quick reminder that the book was written by a credible author. Finishing the book left me with an impression of the book being a marketing product rather than a work of art.Content wise, the book does exactly what it says on the cover - it teaches you how to win people over (no surprise there). The book was first written in 1937 and has since been altered to suit with the change in time. With that said, I wouldn't take anything away from this book other than the concept of being tactful and patient in dealing with people in every circumstance.The author gives examples of tactics that Lincoln and himself have used when in tricky 'real-life' situations, while also noting that these methods used do not guarantee success as situations and individuals may vary with each case...(thank you for the disclaimer, I guess?)This book gave many quick-fixes on how to get along in an environment of different personalities and how to not make life any harder for yourself (and others for that matter) than it already is, albeit provided little insight into bringing a more permanent solution in dealing with difficult people.I guess I'm a little disappointed after reading this book as it came off as selfishly cunning more than empathetic. Definitely a good book to read to remind yourself that there is always a better way to deal with your emotions to avoid bringing about your own downfall, but not something to make a mantra of.Giving this 4 stars because although a little shallow, stuff in this book makes you think a little :)"

"306",305,"Mackenzie","These lessons are absolutely counter-cultural, but so powerful. This is not a book that I will learn from if I just let myself read it once and not pick it back up again. I need to practice these lessons to truly live them out & I know it will be meaningful and worth it. "

"309",308,"Andrew Jarrell","When I started reading this book, I didn't realize it was written in the 1930s. Amazing how timeless these principles of interpersonal communication are. I appreciated the thoughtful, honest approach that Carnegie takes to communicating. Some of his strategies seem crafty, but never insincere. Definitely worth reading this well-known book."

Took a few main points from the book I'll use with friends and when networking.How to Win Friends & Influence People- Smile- Don't critize, argue, or correct people. Show appreciation- People love a listener, talk about them and remember their names- If you're wrong admit it asap- Get them to say yes many times before asking big question"
"324",323,"Gary Kay","The first thing Carnegie does is tell the reader to read each chapter twice. I honestly think I would have done this had he not told me. In print since the 30's, sold millions of copies, his courses are still offered today...you get the point. "

"346",345,"Andrew Winkel","This is an easy, pleasant read affirming the golden rule in dealing with others. There is nothing revolutionary or shocking in Carnegie's advice, and yet it reminds us how infrequently we treat others the way we expect to be treated. I suppose critics would argue that Carnegie was Machiavellian in how he recommended people deal with others, but I saw his frequent admonitions for authenticity as reinforcement that each of us must be genuine.I may re-read this book every couple years just to reconnect with Carnegie's common-sense instructions."
"347",346,"J.f.","This book should really be entitled ""how to be a better human being."" As great as the title is, I think it doesn't target a key audience who this book would help: arrogant people who, of course, feel like they don't need to improve their people skills."

"354",353,"Mukesh Emes","This is a must read book folks! I really enjoyed reading this book. Dale Carnegie tells you his simple and effective techniques to win and influence people. He give you some best examples as well. We wanted to become important to others but we don't pay attention to them. We always concentrate on ourselves. This is book is a nice lesson to us. These are my favourite quotes in this book. ""Talk to someone about themselves and they'll listen for hours."" and ""Make people feel important and do it sincerely."" ABSOLUTELY TRUE isn't it?"

"359",358,"Ibraheem Al-Bazei"," ."
"360",359,"Allison ","What was most interesting about this book for me was that it was published more than 80 years ago but it's as timely now as it was then. The psychological concepts of interpersonal relationships are so well explained and presented with interesting narrative examples of the concepts in action.In the last 20 years or so we've become such a ""Me, me, me!!"" society that this book reminds us of how to be better people, better friends, better employers, better employees. Given the state of the job market today we need all the help we can get too.What isn't mentioned, at least not in the edition I read, is the connection between the principles discussed and spirituality. Today there is a greater trend towards increasing our awareness of those outside ourselves and putting others first. This is the crux of Carnegie's method.Much of what he outlines is basic common sense and decency in dealing with others that we forget all about when we are after fulfilling our own needs as quickly as possible. We completely forget, if we have even ever realized, that attending to others' interests furthers our own as well."
"361",360,"Chris E","The negative reviews for this book are hilarious. "
"363",362,"Coen","The book is full of extremely practical advise on how you can improve on all aspects of your social interactions both privately and in business. The premise of the book is not about manipulating others, but instead showing how you yourself can become a better (social) person by following simple rules. I truly believe that taking the discussed points in the book into practice will positively change your life and I'm already actively applying some of this newly found wisdom. A minor point of critique is that a lot of anecdotes are being described in the book and not all of them are that interesting, which is probably in part due to the time in which the book was written (almost a century ago). Also quite some points seem to overlap a lot and repetition of all sort is spread throughout the book (which also helps hitting the points home). "
"365",364,"Ian Fernandes","Really great read"

"386",385,"Donnovan Simon","Excellent book. The principles are priceless and have stood the test of time. While technology has affected how some things are executed, there is no question to the value of the personal connections and considerations promoted by Dale Carnegie"
"390",389,"Christian Sverrhag","I read this book a few years back and I really liked it. At the same time I couldn't really decide on if it's ok or not to ""fake"" your personality in a way that makes people like you more. Dale writes that you should be sincere about the personality changes that is proposed in the book but it sometimes feels more like something that is added so the changed behaviour would stand out to be too manipulative.I wasn't able to put my finger on what it was that felt wrong with this book until I read Stephen R. Coveys book ""The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change"" a month ago.In the beginning of this book Covey divides personal development books into two cathegories. Books focusing on character ethics and books focusing on personality ethics. This division along with the fact that I had already read the book he refers to when he refers to character ethics (The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin) made it all make sense to me.How to win friends and influence people is a personal development book that focuses on personality ethics. It does not however focus on how to build the character that is needed to live up to these ethics in a sincere way.If you make the personality changes according to these books without having the character behind it to make them sincere you risk that people will judge you as manipulative and that they get this feeling about you that you many times get about sales people that they don't really want what's in your best interest.I really recommend reading all three of these books however and see if you see the same connections that I see."

I can't just expect people to be my friend if I don't put myself out there. Here are some lessons I learned from this book : don't complain or criticize, appreciate, make people feel important and focus on their interests, listen more than you talk, don't argue, see things from their perspective, and more. I know I should apply these lessons to life, but it feels hard. I need to get brave enough and confident enough to. I don't know. Well now I know how to get along with people but it's easier said than done."

"432",431,"Sitong Peng","Interesting read. Carnegie provides plenty of anecdotal evidence for his claims. You will basically get the picture after a few chapters in.

"436",435,"Eman Abdulaziz","The first thing that came into my mind after finishing the book is why I didn’t read it any earlier!

"443",442,"Le Huong Giang","asked one word to describe How to win friends and influence people, I will definitely choose ""inspiring"". While some of the same kind only list out the ""Do"" and ""Don't"" things,this book briefly demonstrate the ideas through various examples and stories. I did not have to try much to remember the theories and instead had the chance to analyze and understand them in my own ways. Sometime I got confused when some ideas are repeated throughout the books, some more than twice, as if the writer really wanted to emphasize them in the reader's minds. Maybe to me the book doesn't word out the way it ought to, because the greatest thing I learn from this book is not how to influence people but that it does not take much time and effort to show our beloved ones that we truly care for them. Although this idea is written in this book as a fundamental rule in communicating and influencing people, just as the book is meant to teach people to behave in a way so that others will love and corporate with them, I realize that while practicing this, I am the first to feel happy and satisfied. I do not intend to influence anyone or to win their love, I just know through the stories in the that there're are great many ways to show our affections and feelings for others, and that it takes time to develop the HABIT of caring for their problems instead of ours. While reading the Second Chapter, I felt the urge to stand up and call my sister who has been in the hospital the whole week taking after my grandad, to text another sister who is working hard at her office, to send my friends and teachers e-cards at the Valentine and to think positively about the recently problems in my family. I don't know if I will be able to have impacts on anyone, but this book has inspired me live more selflessly, and as Gandhi once said: be the change you want to see in the world, may this be a good sign?

"497",496,"H.","At worst this is a collection of charming anecdotes about people being nice to each other with the word ""salesman"" scattered randomly about. At best it is a life-changing guide for social interaction and understanding. For me, it is admittedly closer to the latter and I'm completely and happily surprised by that. The title is totally misleading, and while it does have a mind for business, this book precedes the cynicism of the self help era and names its heroes as historical figures who always asked their butler how Barbara, his mother, was fairing. The author, Carnegie, calls us (and himself) out repeatedly as simple creatures who just want a little appreciation and have a lot of pride, and reminds that everyone else is just the same. Pay a complement, remember a name, let the other person talk his heart out, let him save face, and here's a meandering story about Lincoln and letter-writing to illustrate the point. My favorite aspect, and the attitude that really structures the philosophy, is the rule that a person should strive to (although there is no assumption that this is difficult in practice) develop a genuine interest in others. There is an inherent belief in humanity and the idea that reader has plenty to gain from learning about others. Charming, optimistic, engaging. Good read to start off a new year."

"519",518,"Alf","More of a book on how to make a good impression on strangers. A mix of good ideas mixed with what slight manipulation techniques. Take the book with a grain of salt and you will enjoy it more. My favorites were ""use and instead of but"" and ""say a compliment before giving a criticism."" My pet peeve would have to be that the author never comes across as someone who cares about the reader. He rarely opens up at all in the book and when he does it is to prove a point in the chapter. I feel a book about making friends should be well...more friendly. However, overall a solid and informative read."
"528",527,"Toni","I am all for keepin' it real, and this book keep it reals by shedding light on the importance of tactfulness.

"531",530,"Minal","Nothing in this book is revolutionary. Every principle is obvious, but it's still charming. The references to Rockefeller and Woodrow Wilson are outdated. Swap them for names like Buffet or Gates and the morals remain true. It's clearly a classic and after (finally) reading it, I see why. I didn't learn anything particularly new, but it served as a great reminder of all the things I should be doing but often don't. "

"548",547,"John Martindale","Oh if only the principals in this book were widely practiced, this would would be a happier place! What I loved about this book is that it does not have the typical icky self-help book feel. Its instead Dale exhorting us to show genuine interest in others, respect them, really listen, make their interest your own interest. Seek to see things from their point of view, give genuine affirmation and praise, never criticize or argue, believe the best about them, humble yourself and be quick to confess your faults, etc... I suppose it can all be summed up in ""Love your neighbor as yourself"" and also the scripture ""If you seek to find your life, you'll lose it, but if you lose your life for my sake, you'll find it"" comes to mind, for the way to find life, is to not seek it, but to give yourself away. As Jesus said, ""If you want to become first, you must become a servant to all"". though this is not a religious book, I just feel Carnegie does an amazing job of showing how its really in our own best interest to deny ourselves and prefer others before ourselves. I absolutely loved this book."

I did and it was.The book's core message is that you can force people to do things, you can exercise power over them to bend them to your will, but if you really want the best out of them, you need to find out what it is that drives them and match that drive to your objectives. In short, you must understand what it is that they want. And, in many instances, the desire isn't for money. It's for recognition, being listened to, and being acknowledged. Once you take that approach, it's amazing how the doors open, the atmosphere lightens and things get done.Did it change my life? Not really. Did it change the way I see people in the workplace? Absolutely."

"572",571,"Charles","I'm re-reading it again, because I figure I'd have to polish my social interaction skills with other college students. Surprisingly, the first time I read this book I gave this book a meager evaluation of three stars. I have no idea what I was thinking. But, upon revisiting, I came to appreciate Carnegie's overabundant anecdotes that cut directly to the nub of the advice he's imparting. He doesn't take you on a garden walk like Murakami does. He addresses the issue and constantly engages the reader with his endless supplies of stories. But, another way of enriching the reading experience, is to apply the methods to real-life scenarios. And, so far, that has been working tremendously well for me. Therefore, I think I've earned invaluable insights from this book. It'a always good to revisit old books. The forgetfulness of my memory is quite astonishing. Okay. I'm going off-tangent. 4/5 it is. "

"600",599,"Eleanor","Why do people hate this book, right off the bat? Because nobody likes to think that someone else could use a formula to trick you into being friends with or influenced by that person. The problem with this book is that it is structured in a way that implies each principle can work independently of the others. It's unfortunate that Dale Carnegie made this mistake while organizing the book- he even goes so far as to give examples in each section of the principles working ""independently"" that sometimes sound extremely unrealistic. Almost all of the principles he provides are excellent ideas but the most important thing (and this is something I think Carnegie should have stressed in every chapter and not just the first and last) is obviously sincerity. Don't bullshit people. Say what you came to say. That PROVIDED- being a good listener can take you a long way. Many of Carnegies ideas are RE-active suggestions- you can't just trot into someone's office and ask a person what his or her hobbies are. Get to the point.If you're willing to do a little bit of the work for the author and put 2 and 2 together- The principles work as a group of ideas rather than independently- then you will gain a lot from this book. Since reading it and being in scenarios where there was explicit or implicit haggling involved (let's face it- most of life is some form of bargaining) I've found these tools to be 10000% relevant. And have definitely gained from them. I highly recommend this book for people who would like to have more friends and influence by means of sincerity. I don't UN-recommend this for the insincere, I just know that no matter how hard they may try to manipulate their peers, it'll eventually come back to bite them in the ass.------review after having read a few chapters------Despite the voice of an author reaching into 2010 from almost 100 years ago, I'm finding this book to be incredibly apt and frankly just darling in tone. The author has an earnest and affable voice that makes me happy to pick the book back up. Each chapter offers advice that I can apply immediately and from which I consistently find immediate satisfaction. The author hazards against insincerity or artificiality in applying his suggestions, making this book 100% genuine. I'm not half way through but I can already tell this will be a favorite."
"601",600,"Bernd Schiffer","Audiobook.I wanted to give this book 3 stars: ""WHAT? Only 3 stars for this gem? How can you…?"" is what I hear you saying. Yes, I, too, had very high hopes for this book. And I liked it. That's what 3 stars mean, I liked it. To rate it higher, there were a couple of things missing:- Fewer examples: Carnegie is really giving a lot of examples, up to a point where I'd say: ""Enough. I get it. Please, no more…""- More science: I agree with most of his points, however, he's not backing most of them up with science. There's a few references to B.F. Skinner's behavioral theories, but not much more.- Clearer advice: maybe because the lack of scientific reference in the book, I find a few of his principles questionable. Part 3, ""12. Throw down a challenge."" is not what I want other people do to me (I can do that fine by myself, thank you); Part 4, ""2. Call attention to people's mistakes indirectly."" is what I usually try to avoid, since I value open and direct communication; Part 4, ""3. Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person."" seems to me like what I know as ""sandwich feedback"", i.e. giving negative feedback between giving positive feedback at the beginning and at the end of a conversation. Carnegie addresses this problem with principle 4.3 though, which he sees in not giving _sincere_ positive feedback. But then again, I might have only received insincere positive feedback when receiving sandwich feedback.Other than that, I really liked the book. If it were a tad smaller (fewer examples), it's a really good summary of behaviours to hold dear in life. All the other principles in this book are, from my experience and point of view, very much something to strive for when developing oneself. 4 stars it is.The principles discussed in this book are (via http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_W... ):Part: Fundamental Techniques in Handling People1.

"631",630,"Jonathan Karmel","First published in 1936, this is a classic American self-help book. Despite being a product of its time, I think most of the ideas continue to be relevant. It discusses the following principles:Handling people: (1) Don't criticize, condemn or complain; (2) Give honest and sincere appreciation; (3) Try to make the other person understand why the other person would actually want to do the thing you think they should do. To make people like you: (1) Become genuinely interested in other people; (2) Smile; (3) Remember the other person's name and use it; (4) Be a good listener, and encourage others to talk about themselves; (5) Talk in terms of the other person's interests; (6) Make the other person feel important-and do it sincerely. Win People To Your Way Of Thinking: (1) Avoid arguments; (2) Respect the other person's opinions, and never say, ""You're wrong""; (3) If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically; (4) Begin in a friendly way; (5) Get the other person saying ""yes, yes"" immediately; (6) Let the other person do a great deal of the talking; (7) Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers; (8) Try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view; (9) Be sympathetic with the other person's ideas and desires; (10) Appeal to the nobler motives; (11) Dramatize your ideas; (12) Throw down a challenge. Being a leader (changing your people's attitudes and behavior): (1) Begin with praise and honest appreciation; (2) Call attention to people's mistakes indirectly; (3) Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person; (4) Ask questions instead of giving direct orders; (5) Let the other person save face; (6) Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement; (7) Be ""hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise""; (7) Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to; (8) Use encouragement, and make the fault seem easy to correct; (9) Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest. Making Your Home Life Happier: (1) Don't nag; (2) Don't try to make your partner over; (3) Don't criticize; (3) Give honest appreciation; (4) Pay little attentions; (6) Be courteous; (7) Read a good book on the sexual side of marriage.This all seems like good advice. But it's hard to put in practice, and it's hard to do all of this stuff sincerely. It basically doesn't work if you're being phony. This book points out that you need to genuinely appreciate other people; you can't just flatter them.These kinds of books make me think about a couple of core concepts we're all taught and what they really mean. The first is in this book. The author points out ""probably the most important rule in the world: Do unto others as you would have others do unto you."" I think that's obviously true in a very general sense: give others what they want, just as you would want others to give you what you want. But it's untrue that you should literally do unto others as you would have others do unto you, because others are different from you. You should do unto others as others would have you do unto them. There are only a small minority of people who are similar to me and want the same things I want. I need to figure out what other people want and give that to them; not give them what I would want.The second is ""Thou shalt not lie."" I'm very literal, so telling people what they want to hear, and not telling people what I'm really thinking seems like lying to me. I know that most people don't think of ""white lies"" as being lies at all; they just think of them as an expression of kindness. For me, one thing that is difficult about applying the principles of a book like this is to remember that for most people, in a lot of situations, the literal words that come out of someone's mouth are irrelevant; they actually ""don't count"" as even being part of the communication. The actual communication is in the person's body language and tone of voice. I think of lot winning friends and influencing people comes down to telling what people consider to be socially appropriate white lies, and telling them with convincing body language and tone of voice. Ideally, this can be pulled off without actually lying; rather than saying the hurtful thing you are really thinking, you say something different that is actually true. At times, I think this requires an almost zen-like detachment from one's own feelings and emotions; to get what you want, never express what you actually want or feel. I think that no matter how many books a person reads, it's hard for a person who is actually not compassionate to come across as being compassionate."

"639",638,"Erin K","Great book - but the ONLY section that would NOT work for corporate America today is ""If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically."" Working for corporate - everyone knows if you take responsibility for a blow up, it's a mark on your record and you can get fired for it. That's something I learned from my boss - make sure you know how to play the game - make sure you cover your bases so that you don't get blamed for anything because the second you do, it can cost you that promotion or even your job.Amazing book, the only problem is that the other party must be human to reciprocate and understand your intentions, nowadays in corporations it's difficult to be treated as human being and expect corporate to treat you like one, but following these steps will definitely help.Sometimes the book seems naive at heart compared to how the world has changed today & how it interacts (corporations, internet, etc.), but overall the same principles apply.Other sections were very interesting in the sense that they were very manipulative - you have to understand this book was written to help navigate politics of the workplace, but whether you use these techniques for altruistic reasons are completely up to you. Some of the anecdotes about Charles Schwab, Andrew Carnegie, and others were very interesting in the sense that they were terrible people who settled disputes through manipulation using these techniques. Again Carnegie never claimed to be a moral or ethical person, he wrote this book so that you can SEEM more pleasant and ethical in the workplace. ;)For most readers this fact is lost on them, and people use these techniques in positive ways for good reasons, and even Carnegie insists of using empathy to connect with others. If you use these techniques for good that's all that matters! Definitely apply to your everyday, I think this book should be read by everyone, every single person on the planet! That's how good it is!"
"640",639,"John Ward","I read this book a few years ago as part of a Dale Carnegie leadership training program I attended for my job at the time. I was moving into more of a managerial role and my boss was into these kinds of interpersonal skill building exercises. This is the same course where they teach you to use word association to remember people’s names. The only name I remember now was this hot girl Meghan Ardnt because I figured I “aren’t makin’” any headway with this one once I found out she was married. The format of the course forced us to try out the tools laid out in the book because we would have to give a five minute speech about how we used a particular skill that was discussed the previous week and what the results were. All about stepping out of our comfort zone. One dude stormed out circa week 9 never to be seen again. I think his name was Stormy.The book is about techniques you can use if you’re managing anyone, if you’re working as part of a team, if you’re in sales, or even if you’re in “sales”. The same techniques are just as applicable in everyday life as well. Some examples: Use a person’s name when talking to them; it’s the most important sound in any language. It works! How many people do that? I can count the number I know personally on one hand. It gets attention and makes them feel important.Let the other person feel that the idea is his own. It works! Try leading somebody down the path to what you want them to do instead of outright telling them what to do. Ask question you know the answer to. Nobody likes taking orders, everybody likes to think they are in control. Trickster.Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct. It works! Kinda! Praise for the slightest improvement seems to keep hope up for people but sometimes it’s hard to put a positive spin on the situation after say the second or third job you lost because of your serious drinking problem.I highly recommend this book. While it is easy enough to find the principles listed out online, the book gives real life examples from Dale and his students’ lives. His enthusiasm makes you want to run out and try them right away. Even if you don’t have an opportunity to try them all if you pick out two or three to use, you’ll see positive results. Sometimes it’s fun just to see how far you can manipulate people using as many principles as possible in one situation. Good at parties…try it!"
"641",640,"Emme","I have a friend who thinks this is phony bologna. On the other hand, I see it as a really worthwhile read. Whatever the difference, perhaps I was much more lacking in my networking skills and interpersonal relationship savvy. Maybe I just have the ability to get the good out of a wider variety of sources. Who knows!? I loved reading the many personal stories that Mr. Carnegie used to explain the points he makes about successful ways of being for greatest benefit to relationships. I come into this reading with the interest to communicate more effectively the love and appreciation I have for those around me. If I were reading it as part of a marketing class, I would indeed feel phony. I think Dale Carnegie has a lot of wonderful personal insights and I appreciate very much having read this book."
"643",642,"AnnaBeth","At first I thought this book was deceptive and was teaching ways to trick people into getting what they want. I also thought this book was for sad and lonely people that wanted friends. Turns out, the book is rather honest, insightful and explains how human relations work to a certain extent. Although there are bits and pieces that personally I think cannot be applied nowadays, most of it shed some light into human behaviour and on how to deal with conflicting interests."
"645",644,"Megan Ross","This book is a self-help book for teenage girls, and this is the 2nd self-help book I've read this year. Basically, Donna Dale Carnegie wrote this book to help teenage girls learn how to make friends. The author is trying to say, and is saying, what we need to work on in order to be positively influential to other people (as a ""sister, daughter, friend, and girlfriend"" as she says). You can call this an exposition considering how the author analyzes how we, as teenage girls, handle ourselfs in certain situations. She gives genuine steps to being a positive, friendly, and social, role model. I like this book, I wouldn't change a thing about it. I needed a book like this because I don't have any friends, and I never really did because of how antisocial I am. I tried to make friends during this year but I didn't feel like It was going anywhere, so I quit. I think that I should give this a 2nd chance now that I've read this book and there is nothing that I don't like about the book. It's not similar to a book that I've read before besides ""Your Medical Mind"" considering these are both self-help books, but maybe that's beccause I don't read that much. I'd recommend this book to teenage girls everywhere who need help making friends."

The many examples given finish to convince you to apply them, or at least to try your best to.A must read for anyone who wants to change their behavioural patterns, or just learn how to better interact with other people."

"688",687,"Rick Rowland"," A very easy read to be sure. With a book that has been around this long and is this popular, there is not much new here. I have watched for years so many people mishandle what is taught and directed in this book. This is not an instruction manual, it is a philosophy. It should be implemented and treated as such. The author says it best. ""Remember, we all crave appreciation and recognition, and will do almost anything to get it. But nobody wants insincerity. Nobody wants flattery."" I am of the opinion that one will get a lot more from this book if you think upon this book as a philosophy. Enjoy. "

"690",689,"Tandava Brahmachari","On the one hand, it dismays me that anyone ever needed to write a book on such basic principles of being a polite, friendly human being. On the other hand, it's not like we all actually manage to put these into practice the way we should. The title always sounded slightly manipulative to me, but on actually reading it, I think it's clear he means everything to be done sincerely. It's about becoming the sort of person who does these things naturally, not about using techniques to control people."

"710",709,"Ray Kelly","How to Win Friends and Influence People is informative and entertaining, and just as useful today as it was when it was first published in 1937. This is the case because Dale Carnegie had an understanding of human nature that will never be outdated. Carnegie explains that you can make a friend out of just about anyone and get them to do what you want them to, without arousing resentment, by seeing the situation from that person's point of view. He suggests that you can do this in a number of ways such as by appealing to the other person's highest ideals, remembering their name, letting them do most of the talking and speaking in terms of their interests. For instance, ""let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers,"" and ""talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person."" Carnegie illustrates his points with anecdotes of historical figures, leaders of the business world, and everyday folks. Financial success, Carnegie explains is due 15 percent to professional knowledge and 85 percent to ""the ability to express ideas, to assume leadership, and to arouse enthusiasm among people."" He teaches these skills through underlying principles of dealing with people so that they feel important and appreciated. If there is one thing you learn from the book, it is the ability to understand the different views of other people in different situations. He begins the book with the foundations of developing this skill of understanding others. He extends three principles that if applied will help you identify what other people want and how you can satisfy them. After that he introduces six ways to make people like you. These methods hover around the same three principles mentioned in the beginning of the book. After that the author discusses in two parts methods and principles that help you influence people to your way of thinking. The advice in the book is largely sound, but it’s important to remember that the book was initially intended as a companion book to his classes on how to be a good salesman. In other words, these techniques work very well in relationships that are not expected to be long-lasting so may not be ideal for all your close personal relationships. Similarly these techniques won’t work on all people as there are some people with whom it is impossible to get along. "
"712",711,"Daniela Lumbaca","I have read a few of these 'help/informative' books and this classic by Dale Carnegie has been the best one in my eyes. He uses multiple examples of everything including not only work place examples but everyday at home ones so all types of readers can really relate. "

"742",741,"Josh Steimle","As good today as it was when it was written."
"743",742,"Alireza Shafaei","At the beginning it was fun to discover my lack of social skills on a book that was written decades ago, but soon it became less relevant to my daily life and eventually I lost the interest to continue it. It's like listening to your parents giving life lessons that are inherently really important, and you know it, yet after a while you become immune to hearing them. I think, as the author originally recommended, it's best to skim through the book once just to know what is covered in each chapter, and then on occasions go back to it and learn a lesson or two that's applicable to your life. "
"746",745,"Ian Sherr","What makes this book so great aren't the rules or lists he writes, it's the fun anecdotes. He namechecks nearly everyone from the early 20th century, and he gives some great stories about TR that not only illustrate his point but are frankly just fun to read. Any history major (current or former) would love this title. I'm surprised it's not required reading in upper division courses!"
"748",747,"Rachel Terry","Ha HA! Now I will be able to control your minds and force you all to be my friends!First published in 1936, this is a great book about how to be a nice, thoughtful person. I just love the examples in the book of businessmen sitting down together to work out their problems. I wonder how Dale Carnegie would advise one to handle unhelpful customer support over the phone. That wasn't really a problem in 1936, but I bet he would have some good ideas about it. He gets you to think about interactions from the other person's point of view and how to influence behavior by being positive and appealing to people's nobler sides. Thumbs up."
"750",749,"White","I read this as a teenager, recommended by my mom. She always loved this book and quoted from it often. It is more of a self-esteem book of empowerment. Not bad. "

"756",755,"4Duran D","There are many important lessons in Dale Carnegie’s How to Win Friends and Influence People, but one major message on handling difficult situations or people is to not criticize, condemn, or complain. Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself. In a study done by the world famous psychologist B.F. Skinner, it was proven that an animal “rewarded for good behavior” would learn much more rapidly and effectively than an animal being “punished for bad behavior” (6). This shows that criticism only hinders the problem, whereas, appreciation for good behavior will solve the problem and others as well. The person being corrected or condemned will only retaliate with criticism and condemnation and try to justify him or herself instead of focusing on what actually needs correction. A simile that stuck out that applies to this claim is “criticisms are like homing pigeons, they always return home”, meaning that giving criticisms only end in receiving criticisms, so it is important to “breed sympathy, tolerance, and kindness” (8,18). Through psychological experiments and personal experiences, it is inferable that criticisms and condemnations only seem to cause backtracking from the original intention."
"758",757,"Ankur Gupta","I am not a big fan of self-help books. But I found this one interesting. It is not amoral and didactic (like 48 Rules of Power). It suggests practical common sense ways on how to deal with people with integrity and honesty, yet get along with them well to ensure that your work gets done. It's one of those books that are ""bestsellers"" AND contain useful information too! P.S. - It's less of ""How to win Friends"" and more of ""How to Influence People"". No book can teach you how to win friends. You simply can't ""win"" friends!"

I have found it more challenging to put many of these principles into practice, but also a greater sense of accomplishment when doing so. Maybe I've become more honest with myself. I pledge to read this book and follow its principles at least every other year. I find his stories and anecdotes entertaining and helpful in illustrating his points, and his knowledge of a great many historical figures is worth the price of admission itself!"
"773",772,"Jeroen","Met plezier gelezen.

"775",774,"Nathan Titus","I have mixed thoughts about this book, I guess. Most of the techniques are blindingly obvious, common sense things that people don't need to read this book to know. How do you make friends? Constantly praise people and always be interested in what they are saying! (There is a whole chapter on each)A few of the others are cheap salesman tricks that everyone already uses. How do you make your customers feel important? Talk about their desires and constantly call people by name! (A ""sales pitch"" usually means a lengthy explanation of why people will benefit from buying the product, and salesmen are always calling customers by their names. The first technique is so overused that it is expected, and as soon as the sales pitch begins, the customer begins the task of poking holes in your presentation. The second technique is just downright creepy. When people ask my name at a coffee shop or a fast-food restaurant, I'm always tempted to say: ""None of your business! I'm just a guy standing in line to buy something; don't pretend I mean more than that!"") A few of his ideas are both cheap salesman tricks AND blindingly obvious common sense suggestions. (Smile!) So part of me wants to say that this book doesn't have any original ideas.A couple of problems with saying that, though. This book was written in 1936 and has had enormous influence on the business world. His techniques may seem like ""cheap salesman tricks"" at this point because salespeople all over the world have employed them, finding them incredibly successful. Salesmen use ""cheap tricks"" because they work. Also, Dale Carnegie never says that his ideas are new or original. The bulk of each chapter consists of multiple examples of how successful people have been using the described technique since time began. These success stories concern world leaders such as Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, And Winston Churchill. They also involve high-profile business leaders such as Andrew Carnegie, Rockefeller, Charles Schwab, and others, famous people from Charles Dickens to Ben Franklin to Queen Victoria, and a wide variety or ordinary ""common folks"" stories. (Most of this last category are student of Carnegie courses, and it's hardly surprises that their teacher would have great things to say about their success. Particularly when that same teacher is advising the principle: ""Be lavish in your appreciation and hearty in your praise."" ) Carnegie is not so much inventing new ideas as combining ideas that work into a volume, and he tells you that. Such a tactic today would be a cheap salesman trick; his book was the first of it's kind. It definitely started something, but is it a good thing?I have no answer to that now. First, I read a library copy of the book. This meant I was forbidden to do what the book suggests: highlight key passages, write notes in the margins, and fill the back pages with your own remarks. I found several places where I would have liked to do that. This review is a ""first read"" and this book is not meant to be read only once. The treatment Dale Carnegie recommends seems a little creepy: that you review your notes and the chapters on a regular basis, that you constantly dwell on your experience with the techniques, that you always consider how to live better through them. Seems kind of like the devout Christian's relationship to scripture. I wonder what the reaction in the religious community was back in 1936, or if the if the ""nine suggestions to get the most out of this book"" were added later. More importantly, the test of this book is really applying its lessons to the world of business, an experiment I'll be seeing in action soon. So I give this book a tentative 4 star rating for now, for shear power and influence. How to Win Friends and Influence People indeed. This book has succeeded in both. It has a huge fan base, and has been widely followed. The fans are the friends the book has won, and the following is the influence it has had on people. Remarkable.After the upcoming test, I may change my rating and give an explanation. This review may have to be modified."
"777",776,"M.F. Moonzajer"," I read this book during the Taliban regime (1999) when the TV, Radio and everything was banned. I rented the Persian version of this book from our local shopkeeper. The title was translated ""How to make friends"". It was an interesting book for a 15 years me.I recommend this book for people to learn how to interact with people and approach them. It is a good book overall. "
"778",777,"Quinn Doyle","This is definitely the kind of book that you need to read several times in order to fully reap its benefits. The message of the book is timeless although it was written nearly 80 years ago. He stresses the importance of sincerity and honesty as opposed to flattery which I think really sets this book apart. Some of the anecdotes used as examples were a bit dated and boring, which was to be expected. Overall, this book is a classic that everyone should read in order to better learn how to effectively deal with people. "

"781",780,"Linh Dang","I read this book from a Vietnamese version after hearing people mention and recommend it for years. It is a great book with all valuable advices and lessons, true. Only appearing in my thoughts while reading it, those stories may be changed in some ways to fit into new society. Of course, the core messages will remain with their full meanings but their application should be taken with the consideration of current changing world and life. It is just simply like prior to being a good person to help and care for others, that person should take good care of him/herself.Anyway, it would be an excellent book to read not only once in a lifetime but as many as you wish and whenever you want to find an inner peace and calm."

The influence lessons are always directed in how I should treat people. The author give feasible lessons how to be truly empathetic with other person's situation and how to motivate always. The book often repeats the lessons over and over the chapters and contains lots of cases about the people who did Carnigie's course. Some of them make the lesson clear others are just to sell his course.I strong recommend this book for new leaders and who frequently deals with people and teams."

"794",793,"Maureen","I read this book when I was in high school, and like so many people, it had a huge influence on my life. The two main things I learned from it were to take the time to look at any situation from the perspective of the other person, and that it is possible to get people to follow your lead while still acting morally and ethically. Although virtually everything else in the world may be spinning out of control, human nature does not and has not changed. Manifestations may change, but human nature itself stays the same. For that reason, I can still recommend this book as a tool for becoming better acquainted with the psychological predilections within oneself and others."
"795",794,"Mike Good","This is an interesting read, that supports a very positve philosophy in dealing with people, and gives numerous success stories. There is no doubt however, that the book is dated in a less cynical time. The weight of the examples also apply more towards a person struggling to maintain a leadership position rather than obtain a position of influence. All in all, I do recommend this book, at the very least, it is uplifting, easy to read, and will make its reader more willing to empathize with other people."
"800",799,"Suganandan Yoganandan","Even though the book is dated the concepts of human emotions would never change. Dale Carnegie highlights the principles that are required to get along with people.

"813",812,"Aurelien","A very good book, truly a classic that everyone (and not only business people or salesman!) should read at least once.Carnegie is convinced success depends more on interpersonal relationships than on academic/technical knowledge and, therefore, outlines here some principles regarding how to make, lead and manage such relationships. It is NOT about flattery, selfishness or manipulative hypocrisy -far from that, it's about empathy and consideration for each others. That sounds cheesy but, honestly, how many of us really apply or know how to apply such an approach in our dealing with others? Then here you are: this book contains tips for everyone. "
"814",813,"Brianna Carleton","If ever there were a book I didn't especially want people seeing on my nightstand, here it be. It just feels like it begs for an explanation, am I right? Anyway, I picked up a pretty beat up 1980-something version, half-expecting to laugh my way through the first chapter and then shelf it, but I quickly found my self oddly engrossed. How little I'd known of the very basics of carrying on. The common sense in this little gem is kind of amazing, and Carnegie is darn likeable. I mean really- if you want people to do nice things for you even when you can offer nothing in return, behave more like a dog and be extra happy to see them and super interested in them. I mean I'm majorly paraphrasing here, but lovingly so. If it were any more simple, I'd think I were missing something. If you let it, this stuff can actually help you succeed. If that last thing I said about the dog makes it sound like a manual for selling yourself, rest assured that Carnegie stresses sincerity as much as skill. If you think your twenty-something college professor has more valuable things to tell you than your grandmother, and if you've really nothing to learn from anyone anyway, don't read this book- not that you'd dream of it, of course. But I certainly recommend it to those not drowning in haughty pretense and looking to actually learn something, and particularly to the socially clueless like myself. Happy reading!"
"815",814,"Utpal","Readable book when you have spare time..."
"816",815,"Heinrich Souza","Useful read. Finished reading this back in December, and I still think about it. A better title may be ""How to keep the friends you have by being less of a d***."" While the concepts make sense, it's hard to override instincts and put the concepts into practicePros:* Well presented and structured* Useful information, particularly the section on argumentsCons:* A bit repetitive at times* Inconsistencies between the start of a chapter, and the conclusion* A lot of anecdotes tend to come across as lucky occurrences than deterministic outcomes from following the advice in the book.Would I recommend this book to others? - I already have, but with a grain of salt. This book is great at telling you what NOT to do, but not so great at telling you what to do instead."
"818",817,"Kristof","This is a hilarious page-turner and though the title is a little quaint and corny, Dale Carnegie's enthusiasm is infectious and seems to capture well what must have been a very powerful speaking style. "
"819",818,"Erin N.","Very interesting stuff! I will definitely have to try it out. Apparently this book changed my brother's life so I had to read it, and then some old guys on a plane were like, ""Hey, she's reading Dale Carnegie!"" Some of the stuff is a bit dated, and I wish the material was better organized, but it's still great advice for just being a good person."
"820",819,"Mike Manella","I loved this book. What a novel idea to actually listen and care about people and stop being so selfish. And yes I totally agree 90% of a job is people skills, not technical. There are some people who really only care about themselves and they can and do use the techniques laid out in this book to manipulate people but they are fakes, cowards and truly unhappy people deep down. Side note - for a great read on the subject of selfish, manipulative and entitled people read Aaron James' book titled ""Assholes"". "
"821",820,"Cult","Some truths are timeless. This is a foundational book for all salesmen, negotiators, media people, politicians, and those who want to be a good friend to anyone. Even though originally published in 1953, it has bee reprinted dozens of times as recently as April 2006! Very practical information for all that will improve your relationships and change your life. Really! Not just a clever statement. A GREAT BOOK "
"822",821,"Ray Munyu","A classic book with great tips and helpful reminders with interpersonal relationships. the key word is reminders. He is not trying to teach us common courtesy; he is teaching the importance of consistency"
"824",823,"Billie Pritchett","Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People gives you different sets of principles for how to interact with people, create acquaintance and friendships, persuade someone to your opinion, and become a leader. As for how to interact with people, he advises people (1) not to criticize, condemn, or complain; (2) to give honest and sincere appreciation; and (3) to arouse in other people an eager want, meaning something like convincing people of why they really should want to do what they claim to want to do or why they should do something that you, as someone persuading them, would like them to do. Regarding the other areas the book is about, you can read the list of principles here on the Wikipedia page.Although the book was helpful in terms of its advice, it did offer a lot more principles than most people, myself included, could memorize. And the title, unfortunately, suggests manipulation even though that is not really the point of the book at all; for example, it would be hard to argue that the book is trying to manipulate people when one of its principles for making acquaintances and friends is become genuinely interested in other people. Despite these areas, though, the many principles and the titles, the folksy stories and verbal illustrations of the principles made the book fun. By the way, to be perfectly honest, I listened to this in audiobook, and if you can get it in that format, and listen to it in your spare time, I'd recommend it, because of the warm voice of the narrator."

Some may feel it is like trickery but that is not the message the author is conveying. It is enjoyable too, given that it takes real life examples that happened. The principles are listed after each part to help readers revisit them every now and then. Overall it is worth having a copy of this book :)"
"833",832,"Corrie","Although this book was first published in 1936, all of the concepts can still be used today. However, it is quite amusing to read the stories and examples which could never happen in today's pc world."

"840",839,"Alejandro","Great book. Dale Carnegie really does a good job explaining the art of influencing people and dealing with them. It has valuable principles that apply from everyday life to history changing events. The only reason I did not give it a perfect score was because as I read through the book, the last few chapters were repetitive. They were about the same things and contained the same principals just worded differently. All in all though, How To Win Friends And Influence People is a book that everyone that wants to improve in the art of human relations should read."

"848",847,"DT","I don't usually like business books but this one was brief and to the point. I've heard a lot of people recommend this over the years and I finally decided to check it out. All the advice is practical; the key is remembering to apply it in your day-to-day interactions. A lot of the examples are a little dated, but I think that's what gives it its charm -- if they were modern examples I think it'd be less interesting. "
"849",848,"Srđan Stanić","Some of the examples how to talk to people are a bit naive and might even be counterproductive. Nonetheless, most of advice given in this book are still relevant to this date and can largely improve both your personal and business relationships."
"855",854,"Christine Lynch","Everything Dale Carnegie says in this book is common sense, but it is a REALLY good reminder of how to treat people and get what you want out of business or personal transactions while still maintaining good relationships with people. I will keep this on hand and listen to it again in a year or so when I need to remind myself of the points he makes. Basically it boils down to always put yourself in the other person's shoes, be positive not angry or irate with people, and treat others with respect. The principles are so good, that I am going to copy/paste the outline here so I have them saved:Fundamental Techniques in Handling People1. Don't criticize.2. Give honest and sincere appreciation.3. Arouse in the other person an eager want.✦ Six ways to make people like you1. Become genuinely interested in other people.2. Smile.3. Remember a person's name.4. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.5. Talk in terms of the other person's interests.6. Make the other person feel important - and do it sincerely.✦ Win people to your way of thinking1. The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.2. Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never say, ""You're wrong.""3. If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.4. Begin in a friendly way.5. Get the other person saying ""yes, yes"" immediately.6. Let the other person do a great deal of the talking.7. Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers.8. Try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view.9. Be sympathetic with the other person's ideas and desires.10. Appeal to the nobler motives.11. Dramatize your ideas.12. Throw down a challenge.✦ Be a Leader1. Begin with praise and honest appreciation.2. Call attention to people's mistakes indirectly.3. Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person.4. Ask questions instead of giving direct orders.5. Let the other person save face.6. Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement.7. Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to.8. Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct.9. Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest."
"857",856,"Esther Ruvalcaba","Great book on how to be a good person not a good sales book at all in my opinion "
"862",861,"طارق","Excellent guide on how to talk to people. This is not a book that can be read only once, you have to read it a couple of times while making sure that you apply its concepts. Works like charm!Use it as a reference. My only concern with this book is that some of its ideas can come across as manipulative and Machiavellian."
"863",862,"Mike Chen","The title itself is sort of misleading, since i thought this was some sort of book for making friends or something. However after i started reading i knew how wrong i was. This book is somewhat revolving around the idea of how getting on someones goodside can bring you benefits, as well as simple steps to accomplish it. In a political perspective, this is a book every salesmen should read as it would be very helpful to them selling stuff or getting contracts signed etc. It's not a book about how to get friends, money, and influence in everyday life but a book about how to do those things when your on the job. I recommend reading this before you start a job of anything related to politics."

"874",873,"Ames","I listened to the audio book. The version I have is like a 7 hour book from iTunes. I used to listen to it while I was walking around London. I'm not sure if the content of my audio book is exactly the same as this print book but I'll review it here anyway.I didn't think that I would learn anything from this book that I didn't already know. I thought it would just be common sense. What I was shocked to learn is that bad people don't know that they are bad people. Bad people actually think they are good people. Even murderers think they are good people and will defend and justify their actions. That really shocked me. It was hard to believe at first but now it makes sense and helps me understand people better.Reading this book has helped me get along with people that I wouldn't normally like or have anything in common with. I used to just avoid people like that and not talk to them. But now I can have pleasant conversations with people who I have little to nothing in common with. I recently talked for hours to someone I have nothing in common with at all. We are very opposite and he is the type of person who is extremely opinionated, states his opinions as facts, and thinks everyone who doesn't think like he does is an idiot. Normally I would avoid someone like this or end up in an argument. By using what I learned in this book I had a pleasant conversation with this guy.I'm much better off for having read this book and I would recommend it to anyone. It's nearly impossible to avoid people that you don't like or have anything in common with so this is important stuff to learn."
"876",875,"Skz","I just found proof that i did or rather it was a course requirement to do a book review on this book for my Managerial Finance class.

"885",884,"Mike W","This is a very insightful and useful book. It offers valuable guidance about how to deal more successfully with other people, even when they are initially reticent or even hostile, and it cites many examples, both from the author's own experience and from history, of the successful application of the principles it espouses.Among them are ""Become genuinely interested in other people"" rather than just in yourself, ""Smile"", ""Be a good listener..."" and so on. In general, Carnegie advocates kindness, generosity of spirit, tolerance and understanding, not only as good in themselves but also as advantageous to the person exhibiting these traits.He has no illusions about human nature. He views people as La Rochefoucauld did--as being motivated chiefly by ""amour-propre."" And yet, far from causing Carnegie to disdain his fellow man for pettiness or narrow selfishness, this insight makes him more understanding. 'How can we expect people to be different from how they are and must be?', he might ask.But the book has imperfections. Carnegie is quite selective in his use of historical examples, and sometimes badly misrepresents the cases he cites, in his zeal to show historical support for his own methods. For one example, he takes Abraham Lincoln as a model of persuasive power--not mentioning that Lincoln, whatever his oratorical prowess, was unable to persuade Southerners that he was anything other than their bitter foe, intent on undermining their way of life, so that his election prompted a very bloody civil war and, eventually, his own assassination. Certainly Lincoln was an heroic figure who deserves enormous praise for his management of the war and for ending slavery, but he is probably not the best example of the persuasive power of Carnegie-style bonhomie.And Carnegie points to Socrates, too, as a model of his methods, heartily approving of the persuasive power of Socratic dialectic. Yet Carnegie fails to see the irony in this, given that Socrates' methods aroused such bitter hatred in many of his fellow Athenians that they tried him and executed him. Again, Socrates is one of the greatest figures in Western history, and a model of virtue, but is hardly a model to follow if one wishes simply to ""win friends"".These quibbles aside, however, this book is well worth reading, and is vastly better than the typical self-help book. No less a figure than Warren Buffett has used Carnegie's methods to great success. Buffett is most famous for investing prowess, but equally important to his success has been his ability to manage people, to keep talented people who are already so wealthy that they do not need to work at all, working hard for his company. He does so by following Carnegie's advice, to be lavish with praise and sparing with criticism, thereby arousing in his employees a zeal for their work.I would give this book 4.5 stars if I could."

"892",891,"David Hensley","Classic must read"
"893",892,"Adil","Be lavish in your praise, and hearty in your approbation. Let the other person save face. You can't win an argument. This book, which is now more than seventy-five years old, has persisted because of its core ideas on how to understand other people in today's society. While some of the writing hasn't aged well due to shifts in socioeconomic situations, the majority of the ideas in this book can be applied rather well to our daily lives.This book can serve several purposes depending on your current situation. For some professionals, like used car salespeople or marketers, this book may read as a manual for how to exploit or move the masses to your point of view. For others, this book may act as a cautionary guide on how to avoid the first group's tactics. And for others still, this book describes honest ways to bolster efficiency at the workplace, at home, and with friends. The key idea I received from this book: no matter how you interact with others, always be genuine. False praise and insincerity are easy to spot, even in an age where so many relationships are abstracted by a digital layer."

"926",925,"Karen Leonard","Being such a classic book, I figured I had to read this. It was worth it and everyone should probably read it. I think the hidden gem in this book is that there is advice from many famous people in it - either people the author knew directly or those he studied heavily - presidents and other political leaders, millionaires (from the late-1800s and early 1900s, so very successful people), etc. All the concepts are super simple and there are lots of examples of successes implementing the lessons on the book. Sometimes, the examples seems to attribute the success too much to the single tip in that chapter, when I'm sure there are many other factors at play. Especially whenever there was an example of a tip around parent/child issues i.e. getting a kid to eat his veggies was as simple as convincing him that he could 'wallop the daylights out of the bigger kid [bully] someday if he would only eat the things his mother wanted him to eat'.Concepts have been shared in numerous (unrelated) books and training courses over the last ~80 years, as they are mostly just basic interpersonal awareness concepts. But, it's presented so simply and completely, this book is a good read for anyone, regardless of their strength in dealing with people. It still gave me some new ideas, and was a good reminder about some things I easily forget (like pointing out all the good behaviors and progress in my kids, instead of criticizing their misbehavior). Overall, an easy and worthwhile read. If I had a paper version instead of the Kindle copy, I'm sure it would have been dog-eared and highlighted throughout. I expect (hope) to look at my highlighted notes regularly, to remind me of the lessons in this book. "
"927",926,"Janene","This had some great ideas, I only wish I would have read it earlier in my life. Highly recommend to anyone wanting a refresher course in their people skills. I took this on almost as a class, and took notes for future reference. Lots of solid wisdom in human relations here."

The book has a number of good pointers that I had never consciously thought about, so I do appreciate that they were captured in a way that helped me think about them.I find value in the book not necessarily for myself, but for the fact that it was written and other people have the opportunity to read it. I can think of a few people who would benefit from reading this book.The biggest draw back? The writing style.

Well, after giving it a chance I realized that pretty much of the principles presented in the book are the sum of psychology hacks that are timeless. (Don't be fooled by the old stories and examples about letters written by Lincoln or Roosevelt.)Human behavior and social dynamics is the name of the game in most of the things we tackle, in business and in life, and after being in the corporate world for more than 10 years and as a sales person, you learn a thing or two.

"942",941,"Dave Courtney","Practical and influential in it's own right, this classic best seller remains one of the top books for understanding the realm of influence, relationship and success. I have come against a Christian response to this book and it's measure of success (being fueled by personal and the world's measuring stick instead of God's), but the truth is I see I lot of overlap and a lot of great principles that can help anyone, Christian or not. True, to get the most out of this book we must be willing to see read it as a commentary on what is largely self driven and within our own realm of control and influence. But the question of what we desire to influence those around us with is where the conversation goes further. This is simply a book that helps to expose exactly what sits at the inner core of all human emotion and motivation, and how to tailor that for your own purpose.The book deals with the questions of how to make people like you, how to win people over to your way of thinking and how to influence without the anger and resentment that can follow reaction to ambitious leadership. On the surface perhaps these ideas might come across as a bit offensive and off putting to some. After all, understanding that we all are bred to manipulate in some form or fashion opens up the realization that we have also been manipulated by others to their point of view. But underneath this book simply exposes an uncomfortable reality and challenges the notion that manipulation and influence needs to be negative. And once we are able to come face to face with that, we then are able to ask where we want to sit ourselves and what we want to do with those personal ideas that are burning a hole in side of ourselves. It puts everyone on the same playing field and simply separates based on those who choose to be influenced or those who chose to influence, and then looks at the guiding principles that make up those who can influence well. We all have the choice of what we want to do with this truth and realization, and this book is a helpful tool for navigating that tricky ground of winning people and influencing them effectively. "

Dale lists out the things to be done to influence people with an example each. One simple way to make friends that stick in my mind as I was going through this book is to show that you are interested in people to make to make them your friend.It's not to fear anyone but it's very important that everyone should know -- It's the individual who is not interested in his fellowman, who has the greatest difficulties in his life and provides the greatest injuries to others."

One of the best things about this book is that every chapter has a wealth of anecdotes and stories instead of just instructional text."
"970",969,"Sufyan","very good, ideas wise."
"971",970,"Bobby Luke","This book was actually pretty darn good. That's saying something for me, as I tend to get annoyed with self-help books. Mr. Carnegie is not presumptuous in the slightest. He lets the stories and experiences shared in this book speak for themselves. This aspect of his writing really connected with me, as I never felt him getting on his soap box, or anything of the sort. Several times, he makes comments like ""Preposterous? Crazy? Well let's learn about the experience of such and such a person who used this very process...."" It was also quite an entertaining read - his writing style is one that one can keep you interested -which you can really appreciate in a self-help book. (I am usually falling asleep reading these types of books...) Part of what made it so easy to read was that there really wasn't too much filler, which seems to plague books of this genre. That being said, there was SOME filler - and I think that a large portion of the end of the book could be condensed. He also seems to only provide suggestions on how to handle situations when the people involved are all generally good. He does acknowledge that these methods won't work for everyone (I can think of a few in my life), but doesn't provide alternate suggestions or methods on how to handle these ""special"" individuals. Perhaps this is approached in one of his other works.Negative points aside, this was really the best self-help book that I have read - light years more entertaining and helpful than others of the genre. If you are looking to read a self-help book, this is probably the one of the few that you can finish without feeling like you wasted your time. "
"973",972,"Trulee","It was goodish. It was a good reminder, and some new info. I felt like it was a little preachy, and a person who lived by all of these principles would start to feel fake to me. But it did make me focus on other people and thinking more about them than about myself, which I felt was the true benefit of the book. "
"975",974,"Gunner Guidry","sometimes you just have to hear it to realize"
"979",978,"Chad Warner","Despite its manipulative-sounding title, this book is about genuinely improving your social skills and winning people to your way of thinking. Although I generally agree with his principles, I think Carnegie makes following them sound too easy.Carnegie states that 15% of success is due to technical knowledge, and the other 85% is due to personality and leadership. He says that the #1 secret to success in dealing with people is having a sympathetic grasp of the other person’s point of view. He talks a lot about respecting and understanding other people, and quotes Ralph Waldo Emerson: ""Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him.""Carnegie also talks a lot about praise; he says that praise is more effective than criticism for changing behavior and winning people over, so you should be “hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.”The book includes lessons from people like Jesus, Confucius, Buddha, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Carnegie, Ben Franklin, John Rockefeller, Charles Schwab, and J.P. Morgan. Carnegie provides anecdotes of his own experiences, and those of the people who took his courses.I first read this book when co-workers suggested I improve my social skills, because I received many recommendations for this book. I re-read it because the lessons are so important and worthwhile.Below are the book's principles, along with my notes.Fundamental Techniques in Handling People1. Don't criticize, condemn, or complain.• Criticism is futile.2. Give honest and sincere appreciation.• Avoid flattery.3. Arouse in the other person an eager want.• Salespeople need to show how their products and services solve customers’ problems• Each party should gain; there must be mutual benefit.Six Ways to Make People Like You1. Become genuinely interested in other people.• “You can make more friends in two months by becoming more interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get people interested in you”• Greet people with animation and enthusiasm. When someone calls on the phone, sound like you’re pleased.2. Smile.• A facial expression is more important than clothes.• Encouragement is more effective than punishment.• Don’t feel like smiling? Force yourself; feeling follows action.3. Remember that a man's Name is to him the sweetest and most important sound in any language.• To remember names, tie the name to a person’s features, use the person’s name in conversation, and write and memorize the name.4. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.• To be a good conversationalist, listen and pay attention.• To be interesting, be interested.5. Talk in the terms of the other man's interest.6. Make the other person feel important and do it sincerely.• The law of human conduct: always make the other person feel important.• Follow the Golden Rule: ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you"".Twelve Ways to Win People to Your Way of Thinking1. Avoid arguments.• You can’t win an argument. Even if you win, you make your opponent feel inferior, so you lose.2. Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never tell someone they are wrong.3. If you're wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.4. Begin in a friendly way.• ""'A drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.' So with men. If you would win a man to your cause, first convince him that you are his sincere friend."" – Lincoln5. Start with questions the other person will answer yes to.• The more yeses you can get at the outset, the more likely the person is to accept your ultimate proposal.6. Let the other person do the talking.• “If you want enemies, excel your friends; but if you want friends, let your friends excel you”.7. Let the other person feel the idea is his/hers.8. Try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view.9. Sympathize with the other person.10. Appeal to noble motives.• Treat people as if they are honest and fair.11. Dramatize your ideas.12. Throw down a challenge.• Use showmanship when selling or convincing.Be a Leader: How to Change People Without Giving Offense or Arousing Resentment1. Begin with praise and honest appreciation.• Use ""and"", not ""but"" as your conjunction between praise and criticism. Give praise, then say “and”, then give criticism/correction. Don’t give praise, say “but”, then criticize; it cheapens the praise.2. Call attention to other people's mistakes indirectly.3. Talk about your own mistakes first.4. Ask questions instead of directly giving orders.• People are more likely to accept an order if they had a part in the decision.5. Let the other person save face.6. Praise every improvement.• Give specific, sincere praise.• Praise is more effective at changing behavior than criticism.7. Give them a fine reputation to live up to.• Praise people, and they’ll feel obligated to live up to their good reputation.8. Encourage them by making their faults seem easy to correct.9. Make the other person happy about doing what you suggest.• Convince people by telling them specifically how they’ll personally benefit."

"997",996,"Sambasivagupta Korda","""How to Win Friends & Influence People"" really influenced my mind telling about how to handle different people with his personal experiences.The books starts with how to win friends, he tells a very simple principle how to win our friends - we can make more friends genuinely by having interest in other people within two months and it takes two years in getting other people's interest on you. and gain their attention by genuinely having interest. One of the example what he quoted is really excellent -""How can we say we have love on our friends, it is whenever our friends talk to us we have to stop our work and then listen to what out friend conveys."" He narrated this example with a situation between son and a mother. And by the end of the book he says few principles that every individual should follow to become a Leader. Leader - should always accept his mistakes and then should point out the others mistakes. He should not criticise any one for the mistakes but rather he should praise about the success things and then from those examples he should point to the mistake done by the member."

At first it almost seems like this book is about ""How to be a decent individual in order to manipulate others."" However, with further progress you learn this isn't a collection of tactics to apply mechanically, but path to being a better person.My only critique of this book is that many of the chapters are redundant, and thus seemed dull to read. You can only read ""walk a mile in someone else's shoes"" so many times.All an all, a must read!"

"1038",1037,"Jan Dobiáš","Interesting book from the self-help department. Surely some helpful things written in it, with nice tips on how to apply certain tricks in dealing with people. Generally, just by rephrasing your thoughts and sentences you can come across in a very different manner. This book gets you to thinking about yourself and encourages self-reflection. However, some of the anecdotes are a bit unrealistic in my opinion. For example, someone has a problem with the insurance company as they don't want to pay the full amount one is owed. Then you go and first make the guy from the company feel important and tell him how helping you will benefit him, and on top of that you mention his great reputation to live up to....and just like magic even the most antagonistic counterparty will do as you would like. Take the lessons and applications with a little pinch of salt. "

"1040",1039,"David Feinstein","Published in 1937, it was an overnight hit, eventually selling 15 million copies. Financial success, Carnegie believed, is due 15 percent to professional knowledge and 85 percent to ""the ability to express ideas, to assume leadership, and to arouse enthusiasm among people.""The book is brilliantly written and opens with fundamental techniques for dealing with people, such as refraining from criticism, expressing sincere appreciation, making people like you by smiling, remembering names, and being a good listener.An excellent read for anyone!"

"1045",1044,"Vladimir Prus","This might be most widely known self-help book, written quite some time ago, and it does share many issues with the genre. There is a set of principles postulated by the author (not through any obvious research process), supported mostly by anecdotal evidence (subject to selection bias) and big success stories (not likely to be reproducible). On a more philosophical level, many of those successes might be individual wins in a zero-sum game, not necessary wins for society.At the same time, being written back in 1936, this book had the luxury of talking about many common sense suggestions. Many of them have found more robust evidence since then, are win-win, easy to practice, and so have high ""return on investment"" - and it looks like every single such suggestion is mostly ignored today. So, informal by-example treatment might still be valuable, by basically picturing and storing in memory the examples of concrete situation where the principles can be used, therefore making them spring to action in future."

By praising it you make the person give 150%, almost always.When motivating someone always discuss about what he gains out of it, how you think of solving his or her problems.The royal road to a person’s heart is to talk about things he or she treasures most.Always try to think from the other person’s point of view. People have 2 needs: understanding one another, their place within the social group and the feeling of importance. If you take sides against them then they react so as to acquire that feeling of importance. If you praise them then they will praise you because by doing so they feel they can easily acquire importance by being in the position as to praise their praiser.When you win or lose an argument you lose. You lose in the long run. Criticism and beating somebody will fuel him or her to take action against you in the future. Sort of like karma…"

""ولعل المعلمة الثانية كذبت علي, ولكني فضلتها! قالت لي إن رقصي قديم العهد بعض الشيء, ولكن المبادئ في جوهرها صحيحة. وأكدت أنني لن ألقى عناء في تعلم بعض الخطوات الجديدة.""لقد بثت المعلمة الأولى اليأس في نفسي بتأكيدها لأخطائي, أما الثانية فقد فعلت العكس تماماً: امتدحت الشيء الوحيد الصحيح في رقصي, وهونت كثيراً من شأن أخطائي.وكانت لا تفتأ تقول لي: إن لك أذناً موسيقية .. إنك راقص موهوب. ""وبرغم إيماني بأنني كنت – وسأظل – راقصاً من الدرجة الرابعة, إلا أنني كنت أتشكك أحيانا وأقول لنفسي : ربما كانت تعني ما تقول!. والواقع أنني كنت أنقدها المال بسبب ما تواليني به من تشجيع وتقدير!""

While some of the stuff is outdated, such as I read in a review - calling out everyone's name while talking to them, isn't gonna get you anywhere - but it gives a brief and interesting insight to interpersonal interaction. and yes, this might be aimed a little bit towards sales persons and management executives and it's often pushing things over the edge, but then again, it is better than any 'management advice 101' book I've come across. "

"1089",1088,"Joanne","I read this book on the advice of one of my friends. I think there are some great tips in here for all of us. In a world where we are all so busy the one thing I find myself doing is not being ""present"" in a conversation - I hate that when it happens to me - so I guess others hate that to. What I liked about this book is that it applies across the board whether you are the CEO or the payroll assistant. There is something in there for everyone. Another thing I liked is that this applies equally to family and friends as it does the work place. "

Definitely recommend this book to anyone who seeks to understand the people around you and how to communicate more effectively to get what you want."

"1115",1114,"Rushi","Powerful, quick read. The detractors of this book are taking the information within it too literally, and that is a losing gambit from the get go. The power of this book comes in the form of inspiration and galvanization, not as a step-by-step guide to get people to like you. If you read and follow this book literally, you will come across as a good faker, patronizer, or manipulator.But read between the lines and you start to understand that the greatest ways to make people like you and to get ahead in life is to change, fundamentally, your view on human relationships. It is to put others' interests in front of your own not simply to get something out of them, but to lead a happier life with more success in sales or other avenues. Basically, this is not a guide so much as it is a wake-up call. The only way you can change how the world perceives you is to make a positive change within yourself, and this work gives you many anecdotes and ideas on why and how to make that change. Going up to someone and flattering them is pretentious and patronizing and will never work. Understanding that everyone in this world loves a genuine compliment and loves being recognized, including yourself, will allow you to naturally empathize with people when interacting with them. This is just one of many lessons this short book has taught me.Highly Recommended. "

"1122",1121,"Rebekka Steg","How To Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie is a classic. I have been told over and over again (especially within the business world) that this is a must read book (ironically, for how much this book is recommended, it is rarely followed). I can understand why it is a classic, it is certainly sound advice, but a lot of it also strikes me as fairly common sense, aka the Golden Rule.The book is divided into three parts covering the following 30 principles: Don’t criticize, condemn, or complain. 
   Give honest and sincere appreciation. 
   Arouse in the other person an eager need or want. 
   Become genuinely interested in other people. 
   Smile. 
   Remember that a person’s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language. 
   Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves. 
   Talk in terms of the other person’s interests. 
   Make the other person feel important – and do it sincerely. 
   The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it. 
   Show respect for other person’s opinions. Never say, “You’re wrong.” 
   If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically. 
   Begin in a friendly way. 
   Get the other person saying “yes, yes” immediately. 
   Let the other person do a a great deal of the talking. 
   Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers. 
   Try honestly to see things from the other persons point of view. 
   By synthetic with the other person’s ideas and desires. 
   Appeal to the other nobler motives. 
   Dramatize your ideas. 
   Throw down a challenge. 
   Begin with praise and honest appreciation. 
   Call attention to people’s mistakes indirectly. 
   Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person. 
   Ask questions instead of giving direct orders. 
   Let the other person save face. 
   Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement. Be “hearty in your appreciation and lavish in your praise.” 
   Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to. 
   Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct. 
   Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest. 
  It's not a long book, and I think reading the book over a month, a principle a day, is definitely worth your time. It'll give you food for thought, or at least remind you of some principles you might have forgotten. Quotes I have had some interesting correspondence with Lewis Lawes, who was warden of New York’s infamous Sing Sing prison for many years, on this subject, and he declared that ‘few of the criminals in Sing Sing regard themselves as bad men. They are just as human as you and I. So they rationalise, they explain. They can tell you why they had to crack a safe or be quick on the trigger finger. Most of them attempt by a form of reasoning, fallacious or logical, to justify their antisocial acts even to themselves, consequently stoutly maintaining that they should never have been imprisoned at all.’(This actually reminds me about the book; Mistakes Were Made (But Not By Me) which deals with logical fallacies and how we justify past mistakes and errors).Dr. Dewey said that the deepest urge in human nature is ‘the desire to be important.’You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you."

"1124",1123,"Phayvanh","read this again in 2010, and realized I had put a lot of these principles into practice in the almost 10 years since my first reading of it. Many of the examples are outdated, and involved military sphere as opposed to real world scenarios. "
"1125",1124,"Tee27","In this classic book, Carnegie emphasizes the importance of genuine empathy when dealing with others in both professional and personal relationships. Here are a few quotes that stood out to me: --""A hen has to lay eggs, a cow has to give milk, and a canary has to sing. But a dog makes his living by giving you nothing but love."" --""A great man shows his greatness by the way he treats little men."" --""If you want to be a good conversationalist, be an attentive listener."" "
"1126",1125,"Caspar van Lissa","This book is one of the staples of the personal development literature, and it proclaims a positive message which is not heard often enough: Become GENUINELY interested in people.This one sentence captures the essence of this book, and it is a fundamental paradigm shift that will revolutionize the way you interact with people, to greater mutual satisfaction."
"1127",1126,"Lazybee","One of the few character development books I've read. The book was interesting, It seemed practical to apply. But I didn't read it to apply it in real life. The book seemed interesting and fun, So I read it. The point by point instructions and Advices were really good. I mean, I can see people applying these techniques and gaining popularity. Anyway, Although i read it for fun, it influenced me a little too. If you wish to read it you have my GO AHEAD signal."

"1133",1132,"Naveed","Dale Carnegie's book is a classic must-read. A book about social interaction concepts that, although simple, are essential to understanding how people work. If you systematically apply the concepts taught, you'll notice your network not just grow in size, but the quality of your relationships grow much deeper. Carnegie introduced a simple concept and then backs it up with factual examples. One concept, for example, is to gain a genuine interest in what interests someone ELSE. Abraham Lincoln used to invite people over to his home for dinner, and the night before would stay up educating himself on a topic of interest to his houseguests. The next day, as you'd expect, his guests enjoyed a great time filled with riveting conversation about what was interesting to HIM. Apart from few of the concepts being quite simple, my only serious concern with this book and the reason for the four stars is that IT IS SO CORNY, totally in line with the genre of books written in the 1930s. Every page I feel like I'm talking to a sales guy and he's not letting me get a word in. I still strongly recommend this book to all who may be interested, but be warned that you have to get passed this corny 1930s writing style in order to give the book merit. Hopefully it'll be easier for you than it was for me."
"1134",1133,"Xiaoqing Wang","A very popular book in my parent's time. Unfortunately it seems a bit out-dated in today's context. The English version is a lot better than the Chinese version.

"1142",1141,"Trish","This is a hard one for me to review. On one hand it has a lot of incredible advice that I have found to be true especially for a book as old as it is. On the other hand, much of Carnegie's writing comes across as manipulative. One of the truthful statements he makes is ""When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic."" and overall the book is his summary of how to get these illogical humans to do what you want. This illogical human has crazy ideals that one day people will be a little more real and genuine and thus I can't say I love everything he writes. Regardless, this is definitely a worthwhile read."
"1143",1142,"Felicia","One of those books that I always heard everyone should read in their lifetime. It has some good tips on managing others, albeit a bit obvious. A quick read that reinforces that kindness and humility go a long way! :)"
"1144",1143,"Lujun Fang","A interesting read for anyone looking for improving inter-personal skills. The keys ideas through out the book is about try to praise instead of criticize, be interested in other people and think from the other people's perspective. These are good high level ideas to remember, although it will take real experience to see if these high level ideas can be used to deal with more complex situations in real life. "
"1146",1145,"Taka","Great (4.5)--A must read for anyone looking to improve their social skills. Actually, this should be a required read for everyone, period. Unless you're a hermit, this book really makes you see social dynamics in a whole new light. Many people might think that all the principles delineated in the book are ""common sense"" and ""obvious."" But really, it's one thing to understand and another to be able to practice it. You can read book after book on how to play golf and not be able to play at all, even though you ""understand"" it and every move makes sense to you.Understanding and doing are completely different, and it's when you do actually put the principles to use that you see the results. It's unbelievable how these simple, commonsensical principles are NOT practiced by people. And it's amazing how actually using them in your daily life produces results you have never expected before.The only complaint I have for this excellent book is that its later part didn't have enough concrete examples to illustrate how to use the principles (thus the 4.5 it gets). Other than that, all the anecdotes were fascinating, principles well-explained and well-organized, and every bit of information was useful to the highest degree. I haven't come across a book that's so simple in its contents and yet so useful.HIghly recommended."
"1150",1149,"Kyle Wild","This book is important.It's breezy, applicable to any pursuit, and it's filled with quaint, old-timey language. And because it's so wisdom-packed and I'm such a slow study, I plan to re-read it like once a year."
"1151",1150,"emily","The poor reviews of this book are amusing, claiming this book wants to turn you into a manipulator, not a friendly person. Perhaps they see it that way, and I can see why they might, but the message I got from this book was the power of positivity. Dale Carnegie points out how the application of a positive mindset, that looks out for positives instead of negatives, can vastly improve your life and those around you. It does not encourage manipulation, it simply points out basics of human psychology, tells you a lot of stories about people who used positive reinforcement instead of negative (something any first year psychology student will learn) and how this led to them achieving their means much more pleasantly than if they had taken a bitter, angry, condescending, forceful or otherwise negative approach. I've read or heard most of these tips myself over the years, but it is eye opening to read everything collated. Old sayings make a lot more sense and I'm hoping to strive to be less of an argumentative person, as I tend to find myself in a lot of arguments that lead to everyone being angry and disappointed. The main point is to be nice. Don't pick fights. Consider the feelings of the other person, be empathetic and put yourself in their shoes before you say a thing. How that is in any way manipulative or bad is not something I can comprehend. If more people socialised in this way the world would be a far more tolerant, pleasant place to exist in. "

"1164",1163,"Lora Grigorova"," How to Win Friends and Influence People: http://readwithstyle.wordpress.com/20...According to Goodreads (the Facebook for the reading geeks), I started reading How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie on the 10th of June and I finished it on the 21st of October. No, I didn’t read a page per day, nor did I read it alongside other books. I simply decided to start reading it on the 10th of June and then I gave up. I decided to start reading it several times afterwards and again I gave up after opening it on my Kindle and seeing the first page. What made this book so repulsive to me was the title and the caption below it. How to Win Friends and Influence People sounded to me more like How to Manipulate People into Liking you and How to Manipulate Them into Doing Whatever You Want. Definitely not the type of skill I am looking for in life. I rather not manipulate people into being my friends, I would rather for them to like me for who I am (however difficult that might be). And also, I definitely don’t feel like manipulating people into doing what I want. I would prefer if they do it because I manage to convince them using logic, intelligence, charm, or…well other purely feminine skills :) . Secondly, the caption is a quote from Warren Buffet: “[Carnegie] changed my life”. As much as I admire Mr. Buffet and as much as I enjoy reading his interviews, stories about his life, and memorable quotations, my strong contempt for self-help books is stronger. I have expressed numerous times the view that the self-help authors of the sort of Jorge Bucay, Andy Andrews, etc. do harm people rather than help them. The well digested wisdom of positive thinking and positive affirmations, and the idea of looking at life through pink-coloured glasses doesn’t in any way alter people’s attitude towards that same life. It just teaches them how to focus on changing outward actions instead of inward thoughts.So you would understand my utter unwillingness to read How to Win Friends and Influence People. This book has been recommended to me by one of my best friends for quite a long time and only this recommendation did actually make me finally read it this month. As I have said, books have that special power of finding you exactly when you need them the most. If I had read How to Win Friends and Influence People months back, I doubt I would have been as much impressed by Carnegie as I am now.I am slowly getting to the point that Dale Carnegie’s How to Win Friends and Influence People is not about how to manipulate people. It is rather about how to change your approach towards people and how to understand and fight the natural flaws of the human character, and most importantly of the human ego. Initially, Carnegie started teaching seminars to business people on how to more efficiently deal with their colleagues, on how to tackle conflicts in the working space and on how to win people over to their thinking. These seminars eventually translated into How to Win Friends and Influence People, which lessons can be applied not only with colleagues, but with friends, family, and even with random people you get in contact with.Read more: http://readwithstyle.wordpress.com/20..."

"1168",1167,"Holly Hunt","All good points, lots of things to think about that will make you a nice person to be around.The end, a chapter on marriage, is ""quaint"" to the point of being sexist. Most of the points boil down to respect and enthusiasm, but they're phrased in archaic and regressive language.That considered, I think the book is a non-skeezy collection of legitimate suggestions for improving how you handle people in all situations of life."
"1169",1168,"Gwen","Okay, you know what, yes. I read How to Win Friends and Influence People. Even though it's corny.There's some good stuff in here. None of of it is ground-breaking but man would it be nice if more people followed some of these suggestions, myself included. So, working on that.Also, a lot of little anecdotes, some of which were terrifying. To get someone to do what you want, make them the leader of the thing! Like the lady who was having problems with boys rushing over her lawn and ruining her garden, so she made the ringleader the Chief Inspector Of Not Screwing Up The Garden. And it worked so well, he made a bonfire, heated up an iron rod in it, and threatened to brand the other boys if they ran across the garden! How about that! Just dandy, Dale!"

It was excellent, with simple, easily understood (though perhaps not so easily implemented) suggestions for improving one's human interactions.The basic point of the book is to suppress one's own ego and to cultivate a genuine interest in other people. Most of us, me definitely included, are very protective of our own egos and are often too busy caring for them to pay attention to others.I definitely recommend the book to anyone who has to deal with people daily. Which is, of course, everyone."

"1178",1177,"Ron Thongsithavong","The nonfiction book ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" is a book that Dale Carnegie wrote to give you tips on how to better yourself with your friends and others involved in your everyday life. He starts by giving you techniques on how to handle people and ends with showing you how to become a leader.The theme of this book is that you can always find things to help your social skills. Throughout the book, Carnegie teaches you essential ""do's"" and ""don't's"" when it comes to bettering your social life and overall outlook in life. Carnegie's style of this book is listing, he uses listing by cutting his main points into parts and his parts into chapters. This style gives you the most important points that he is trying to get you to understand. The style of this book is a narration because it goes in order on what you must do first to achieve a better overall social appearance and better social skills. I think that this book was very eye opening and has changed my view points socially as well as ways that I can influence people. This book was a different read for me for sure but I was quite pleased with what this book left me with. I would not change anything about this book because it is so well written and I think that anyone who is trying to better themselves socially. "

"1218",1217,"Mina Soare","I finished this as an audiobook a year ago now, gave it two stars and generally wasn't very impressed. Time wore on. Through some glitch on my iPod, whenever my audiobook of choice ended, chapters of this would pop up again, and again, and again. Sometimes I was so bored I listened, and you have to give it to the Caesar, some of the examples were rather funny.I started applying some of the stuff, which was rather basic, and it worked. While I didn't have any major issues with the people beside me, I wasn't exactly enamored with society and when miscommunications happened I wasn't stellar in dealing with them. Long story short, people were generally separated in those who could do damage and those who couldn't and the general approach was to treat with both as little as possible.I won't give it away, because you can't take the main 20-ish pieces of advice in the book without the book. I can tell you that my writing, which could have been pigeon-holed into condensed, succinct or sarcastic has started to develop a rather human tone on the way and while I still don't speak in public as well or as often as I should, I am more fluent, confident and it feels like less of a burden."

"1220",1219,"Pieter","You can find all sorts of things wrong with this book - outdated examples, language etc. I enjoyed this thougt provoking and well researched book tremendously. I realise mistakes made and ingrained my whole life. I beleive that even though advice and examples sound naive, human nature stays esentially the same and should these principles be applied the way the author intended, they will bear fruit. To apply these pricipals would be more difficult though and just reading the book without applying yourself to it will not help much. For this reason I will read it again soon."

Once i remember Michael in his visit to Chennai we went down to Nuts and Spices store to buy a energy refreshing drinks , where he remembers the Store Cashier Name that shows we are giving importance to him and he in returns same to us . This made clear that make people starting liking us by showing Interest in them , smile, remembering the persons name is to that person is great , since Name is sweetest sound in any language.Book teaches us how to work with others and be nice,it's about how to get along with people., Praising and encouraging every improvement and Progress .This book turns our relationships around and improve our interactions with everyone in our life."

Even if you think you have superior social skills, I still think this is an important addition to everyone's library. Highly recommend. Very short read. Some of the anecdotes are repetitive and, in my opinion, unnecessary. "

"1243",1242,"Book'd","My First Dale Carnegie book and I must admit I am thoroughly impressed with what a mere 300 odd pages book has to offer.How to Win Friends and Influence People was recommended to me by my friend-cum-colleague Chintan Bhatt. Sadly, it took close to 2 weeks to finish reading this book as I was reading through an e-book and e-books really do slow down my pace of reading.My job requires me to converse with Directors and Senior-most Managers from the Corporate Biggies across the globe which I must confess tends to get unnerving. I mean, okay, it is one thing to manage to squeeze two minutes out of their precious time for yourself and an altogether different thing to make them listen to what I wish to convey and demand of them.It is tough and moreso when you do not have a tactic on hand to go about successfully achieving your goal. During a casual discussion, I voiced out my concerns as to how it is next to impossible to speak to the concerned person and get your job done through them. That's when Chintan mentioned to me that I should read this book if I wish to make my clients want to do what I want. And it sure is an immense help toward changing the way you look at things and improving the way you interact with people.Effective conversation is essential in professional as well as personal life. And the most important driving factor is selfless-interaction. Being kind and nice is the key to successful interaction and with exemplary instances does Dale elaborate them. These few lines are stuck in my memory even though I finished the book long back
“It isn't what you have or who you are or where you are or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think about it.”
It is not meant for a particular age or group of people but useful for everyone. A must read if you feel that your conversation with someone is leading you nowhere. Try this book and feel the difference yourself."
"1244",1243,"Brenda Cregor","This book was given to me by a bishop, years ago...Hm.

"1245",1244,"Viraj","Overall: A well written book with a lot of examples, including many of good folks from the history and many without any citation, but none-the-less seem real. The examples are written so that the message goes across well. Repetition is avoided. The stuff mentioned is pretty obvious and simple, but important and often ignored. Worth reading multiple times as the preface recommends. TEXT DELETED105	SIX WAYS TO MAKE PEOPLE LIKE YOUPRINCIPLE 1: Become genuinely interested in other people. PRINCIPLE 2: SmilePRINCIPLE 3: Remember that a person’s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language. PRINCIPLE 4: Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves. PRINCIPLE 5: Talk in terms of the other person’s interests. PRINCIPLE 6: Make the other person feel important–and do it sincerely. 110	You cannot win an argumentWhy not let him save his face? He didn’t ask for your opinion. He didn’t want it. Why argue with him? Always avoid the acute angle. Don’t forget this lesson! I have come to the conclusion that there is only one way under high heaven to get the best of an argument—and that is to avoid it. You can’t win an argument. You can’t because if you lose it, you lose it; and if you win it, you lose it. Why? Well, suppose you triumph over the other man and shoot his argument full of holes and prove that he is non compos mentis. Then what? You will feel fine. But what about him? You have made him feel inferior. You have hurt his pride. He will always resent your triumph and “a man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still…” 112	Which would you rather have, an academic theatrical victory or a person’s good will? You can seldom have both. Buddha said, “Hatred is never ended by hatred but by love,” and a misunderstanding is never ended by an argument but by tact, diplomacy, conciliation, and a sympathetic desire to see the other person’s viewpoint. Better give your path to a dog than be bitten by him in contesting for the right. Even killing the dog would not cute the bite. 114	How to keep a disagreement from becoming an argument:1.	Welcome the disagreement: Remember the slogan, “When two partners always agree, one of them is not necessary.” If there is some point you haven’t thought about, be thankful if it is brought to your attention. Perhaps this disagreement is your opportunity to be corrected before you make a serious mistake. 2.	Distrust your first instinctive impressions: Our first natural reaction in a disagreeable situation is to be defensive. Be careful. Keep calm and watch out for your first reaction. It may be you at your worst, not at your best. 3.	Control your temper: Remember, you can measure the size of a person by what makes him or her angry. 4.	Listen first; Give your opponents a chance to talk. Let them finish. Do not resist, defend, or debate. This only raises barriers. Try to build bridges of understanding. Don’t build higher barriers of misunderstanding. 5.	Look for areas of agreement: When you have heard your opponents out, dwell first on the points and areas on which you agree. 6.	Be honest: Look for areas where you can admit error and say so. Apologize for your mistakes. It will help disarm your opponents and reduce defensiveness. 7.	Promise to think over your opponents’ ideas and study them carefully: and mean it! Your opponents may be right. It is a lot easier at this stage to agree to think about their points than to move rapidly ahead and find yourself in a position where your opponents can say: “We tried to tell you, but you wouldn’t listen.” 8.	Thank your opponents sincerely for their interest: Anyone who takes the time to adisagree with you is interested in the same things you are. Think of them as people who really want to help you, and you may turn your opponents into friends. 9.	Postpone actions to give both sides time to think through the problem: Suggest that a new meeting be held later that day or the next day, when all the facts may be brought to bear to preparation for this meeting, ask yourself some hard questions. Could my opponents be right? Partly right? Is there truth or merit in their position or argument? Is my reaction one that will relieve the problem or will it just relieve any frustration? Will my reaction drive my opponents further away or draw them closer to me? Will my reaction elevate the estimation good people have of me? Will I win or lose? What price will I have to pay if I win? If I am quiet about it, what the disagreement blow over? Is this difficult situation an opportunity for me? PRINCIPLE 1: The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it. MORE LATER... "

This book summed up the most basic rule in human relationship: you have to treat people with sincerity, and you have to have genuine interest in people.

"1299",1298,"Ray Hansel","HOW TO WIN FRIENDS AND INFLUENCE PEOPLE???Based on my personality I don't have the ability to persuade people. Most of the time I want to spend my time alone rather than to spend it with others. Even if i'm introvert by nature doesn't mean I can survive without people. God said ""It's not good for a man to be alone"" and ""No man is an island"" according to the English poet John Donne. We can't achieve success and solve our problems alone. Revealing our feeling is the beginning of healing.Winning friends and influencing people is indeed a very tough work. You can't do it in just a snap. I believe that we can't make everybody love us. There's always a so called basher or a hater in our lives. Bill Cosby quoted ""I don't know the key to success but the key to failure is trying to please everyone."" Attracting people can be done usually by a famous celebrity, politician, or if you're working in sales or any business related jobs.The bible says "".....Our purpose is to please God, not people. He alone examines the motives of our hearts"" (1 Thessalonians 2:4). Even if there'll be times in our lives that we should please people for a certain reason we must not be gone astray from the real purpose. Once we put our security to God, our relationship with people will put into a perspective. We'll learn the counter-cultural way of loving our neighbors as ourselves. We'll learn how to treat others with selfless love, dignity, and respect regardless of how we feel. So in case you win a friend or influence a person, it's not because of you alone but because of God's intervention and purpose. Because you decided to please God in every area of your life, you'll be used as an influence to share the message of God's love and salvation to others through your words and actions. This is a reminder to each and everyone of us. "

The only thing that I have against this book is that once each principle is laid out and a few examples are given, there really is no need to drag out the point for another couple of pages or so. This book has changed the way I perceive people, the way they act, and the things they say. We all want to find approval and all want to feel important.

Sin embargo, la curiosidad y el hecho de que sea un texto ícono, recomendado en tantas listas de clásicos, me hizo intentarlo de todas formas.Me alegro de ello, porque resulta que lo encontré BUENÍSIMO. Me enterneció y me hizo reír, y es que vi a tantas personas conocidas en sus relatos. También a mí misma. Me causó tanta gracia, y además está tan bien escrito. No solo aprendí, sino que también lo disfruté. Me hizo sentir simpatía por todo el género humano y con la simpatía... bueno, con la simpatía se logra todo.Creo que es un libro amable y, aunque algunos ejemplos lleguen a ser sospechosos... me lo creí. Tiene sentido. No opino, como dicen otras críticas, que sea un texto meramente complaciente y zalamero, sobre cómo caer bien mintiendo... en vez, siento que es un tratado acertado sobre los beneficios de saber escuchar, y las consecuencias de tratar a la gente con amor, y también a uno mismo. El amor hace florecer todo, incluso a las personas. Hace que uno quiera cooperar, en vez de oponerse. Hace que todos brillemos, tanto los que dan la mano, como los que la toman, cuando recordamos que somos un equipo.En fin, que me encantó. A poner sus ideas en práctica.

Helping others feel that way is the quickest way to connect with them and help you accomplish your objectives. It sounds cold and self-serving, but I don't get the sense Carnegie means anything other than how to connect sincerely with others and suceed -- after all, he's giving people career advice. It's worth a read, especially as a classic of the self-help genre."
"1353",1352,"Ev","Overall I think this is a really useful book which I would recommend to anyone. However, I think it's important to understand that this is way of initially starting relationships. These tactics are not sustainable long-term. One thing that the book supports but doesn't clearly point out is that people are drawn to those who seem to care about them. It points out the ways which we might not notice that tell people we care about them. "
"1357",1356,"Dustin McQuay","This book taught me to see things from the perspective of others and take accountability for my own successes and failures."
"1361",1360,"Chairunis","baguuuuus"
"1362",1361,"خادم المعصومين","A great book recommended by my father and I really found this book really useful in terms of dealing with people in general and as the title suggests wining friends A great book that I recommend to anyone the only problem that I see with this book is that it is a bit outdated but at the same time way ahead of its time"
"1366",1365,"Brenda Huntsman","Some good suggestions and reminders about relating better with others...in a nutshell putting others first."
"1368",1367,"Davey","Helps me sometimes, but really has to remember it if i need to "
"1370",1369,"Emmet","It seems I would see references to this book everywhere I turned, so I decided to read it. It's got great content and gives some really good advice about how to handle relationships with people. Some of the concepts were pretty obvious but it doesn't hurt to go over common courtesy. I found it had a lot of topics and advice that has helped me personally more than it has with my relationships. Regardless, this is a book everyone should read."
"1373",1372,"Kenneth Zhu","Good book to enjoy reading."
"1376",1375,"Daniel Farrell","I'm sure this will not be the last time I read this book. An excellent summary of techniques in leadership that I'm sure will be useful into the future."
"1377",1376,"Michael Zucco","The first half of this book was far more interesting to me than the second, mainly because I'm not currently in any sort of position of authority, but it was all great information for in introvert such as me. We shall see in the coming weeks just how big of an impact it had on me, but I'm hoping I can keep many of the things listed in mind when dealing with others, as it not only seems like it will improve my social life (providing it works well), but will make me feel better about the person I am. "
"1378",1377,"Cristian","I'm giving it 4 stars because of the importance of the book. If everyone applied even just a few points from it, life in general would be a lot more enjoyable. That being said, about 80% of the book is anecdotal and at times, reading another story about someone improving something at their workplace gets a bit tedious. A lot of the points made in the book aren't ground-breaking and you're unlikely to discover something you've never heard before, but the points still merit mention since so few people regularly apply them. I'd give it 3 stars but the extra star will give it more visibility. Worth going through at least once. "
"1382",1381,"Murshidul","A very nice book that portrays the human psyche and how to get into the good books of others. A great read for understanding people and developing relationships."
"1383",1382,"Guillermo","It is a very useful and iluminating book. It is not boring at all but on the contrary, Dale Carnagie made it enjoyable and easy to read. Definitely one book I recommend to everyone who would like to be a little better himself."
"1385",1384,"Javatis Midget","This book is a must read for everyone especially those who are in roles of leadership! There is a time and place for everything. Just because you are right, you still might be wrong... Read this book!"
"1386",1385,"Dan McAferty","Very enlightening. Shows specific things to be nice to people and have them like you back. Also attributes you need to be a successful leader."
"1387",1386,"Oliver","A great book that helps the reader understand key actions to connect, understand and influence people. The important thing to remember throughout this book however, is that our intentions and actions should be genuine. Without that, we run the risk of being seen as a manipulator and lose sight of the entire purpose of speaking with people and motivating action.I also enjoyed reading this book because it presented information through the actions of different characters we have all heard about, such as the past US presidents, inventors, philosophers etc. Dale Carnegie has done a great job in writing this book, since I have found some of the methods mentioned to be effective in my daily life."
"1388",1387,"Jon Smithers","The title might be somewhat off-putting, and some of my friends were confused, saying ""but you HAVE friends"". But the book is full of insights concerning relationships and human engineering, all backed by good examples, and gave me a much better perspective on how to handle important interactions. It's mainly applicable in a professional field (business relationships), but can also be good for relationships with family and friends, I think, taken with a grain of salt. I'd probably recommend this to anyone. "
"1389",1388,"Orgbiasa","this book is interesting for anyone who learn about skill with peoplethe way to tell us by people's story"
"1390",1389,"Tony Guinta","Great book, terrible title!The title of this book seems to imply that this book will teach you how to manipulate people into doing what you want. What it really discusses is how to conduct meaningful interactions with others, by treating others with the same integrity and respect that we all would like in return. It is the mother of all self help books and you will find that Covey echos many of the concepts discussed in this book."
"1392",1391,"Vikram Kalkura","A well written book with great examples of men in the past. This book should be read by all the mangers because it does tell how bad a manager can get if you don't follow some of the basic principles in life of smiling and listening. Recommended for all ages. Don't be a talker and if you want to be one then make sure the other person is a good listener :-)"
"1394",1393,"Tyler Hurst","I listened to the audio version, which made the book seem reaaaaaaaaaaallllllllllllly slow, but not boring. Most of the book was examples of how Dale's approach works, and how to get what you want while not making the other person feel slighted.Like most old books, I had to force myself to not roll my eyes at the clichéd mentions, knowing that this book IS the original.Certainly a worthy read, if only to remind you to slow the hell down and think about how you're treating people."
"1397",1396,"Ida Silvia","The author has a great understanding about human nature. He help us to understand how to dealing with people and make them important and feel appreciated. He also help us to handling with other without making them manipulated. These book is rich of relationship solution! "
"1398",1397,"Jensa","Great, great book! The concepts can be applied to parenting, teaching, business, basically anywhere in life. I think this should be required reading in college! It's just the basics of how to work with people...we forget how important the little things are."
"1401",1400,"Leopold","A well written book. Enjoyed reading it..."
"1403",1402,"Teo Papadopoulos","Very interesting stuff!"
"1404",1403,"Devon Aguirre","Although this book has a lot of common sense in it, it support its points with anecdotal evidence that comes across as being genuine. The mix of lesson and story made it very effective in showing how to implant the discussed techniques. I enjoyed it and was glad to have read it. "
"1405",1404,"Ashishg","Great practical guidelines for each of us in developing human relations."
"1407",1406,"M","A classic book that has already made its mark. But for the modern day, How to Talk to Anyone by Leil Lowndes is a formidable supplement."
"1408",1407,"Tricia","Fabulous book that made me realize everything I did wrong with my relationships, especially in graduate school. But there were a few affirming moments when I realized what I have been doing well in my life. This book is geared for those in business but everyone should read it, as it is about basic principles of human interaction. Up sides are that it is pro-human relations and makes you want to improve yourself. It also has tons of historical and interesting stories. Down side is the obviously sexist time it was printed and many statements are offensive to modern women. "
"1409",1408,"Governor","It was a fun book to read. Most of what is written in it is common sense, but it nice to have someone point it out to you with a story to remember it. What's actually totally awesome, is that the book is so old that a lot of examples are old gangsters and mafiosos. Everything is awesome !!"
"1411",1410,"Isa","I had the pleasure of listening to How to Win Friends as an audiobook on my commute to work. It's a classic for a reason - full of common sense advice (the type we're prone to forget) and charming anecdotes from the early 20th century that fortunately have never been updated, providing a very interesting view into the professional and personal lives of folks in the 1920s and 1930s. The principles in the book, like most good advice, are easy to understand but harder to enact consistently. I found myself wanting to strive for them, though - and that made this book worth it for me."
"1413",1412,"Charmless","I read this book while waiting in a really long line at the DMV more than a decade ago. Although I didn't really learn anything new because most of the stuff that Dale Carnegie brings up on here have already been pretty much taught to me by my wiser elders while growing up, I still value this book and give a copy of it as a gift every now and then, especially to those who seem to need it.One of the best parts that I remember from this book is the following passage: ""If some people are so hungry for a feeling of importance that they eventually go insane to get it, imagine what miracle you and I can achieve by giving people honest appreciation this side of insanity.""I couldn't have said it better myself!"
"1415",1414,"Robin Wareing","This was a really good book. The information in it is practical and simple. A lot of self-help/self-improvement texts seem to be a little ""preachy"" and superior, this isn't.This is a worthwhile read for anyone interested in improving their interpersonal skills and understanding of social dynamics."
"1416",1415,"Julien","This is a starter. Don't settle on this book. Also, it's often misunderstood by young minds."
"1418",1417,"Elie Rizk"," From when I heard about this book, I felt as if it was necessary for me to read, for future experience, and as I started reading it, I learned many ways to gain friends and repect from others. Although, the ways are not only listed, but are proved by quotes, the author's experience, and real historical events.  After you read this book, you get more cautious of your actions, and you also are able to catch a mistake you might do before even doing it, which, obviously will make you a better person, and improve your manners.  The reason for giving it a four star rating is that it made me feel like reading a history book, which of course isn't that exciting. The writer proves his point in many ways when only one can be sufficient for the readers to agreewith his objective, but other than that, I find this book a great key for improving yourself, as it gives you amazing techniques in handling people, and others for making people like you. I think that the techniques and advices given, are everlasting, because this book covers human nature. Also, some proof for this point of view is that the author mentioned many historical events where these suggestions were applied, and are still affectionated at the time."
"1420",1419,"Jonny","Absolutely fantastic read.This book covers basic principles in human relations and how to apply them to everyday life. I found this book not only inspiring but easy to follow and implement changes in the way I relate to people I meet everyday."
"1421",1420,"JP","I can see why this has remained such a timeless classic in everything from business to sales. The concepts are all rather simple, but the author, through each revision, manages to present such a crackling, quick moving lesson that one if forced to agree and attempt to change accordingly. [return][return]I read this again in conjunction with the Carnegie Immersion course. Anyone would benefit from both. There are a lot of fine take-aways I could cite here but the main point is probably to practice it."
"1424",1423,"Dustin Gaughran","I wish I had read this when I was 15 instead of 33. Time will tell if it helps me any, but I believe with conscious effort, the lessons in this timeless classic will ultimately be to my advantage as an adult. We'll see..."
"1427",1426,"JC","Apparently I've been taught most of these principles thorughout my life - they all seemed like common sense to me and things that I thought all people already knew. That's not to say that I'm doing all of these things or that I'm great at some of these things, but they are certainly things that I've been taught and strived for my entire life. I'd like to get an actual copy of this book as I was just listening the audio version and so it would be good to be able to mark parts of this up and review it in more depth."
"1429",1428,"Chantal","A classic. I read it in junior high and picked it up again a few years ago. It is a classic and one that I read again from time to time."
"1430",1429,"Vinuth Hr","Dale Carnegie was alive nearly 3 generation before me!! but his writings follow the world order forever..."
"1431",1430,"Magdalene Lim","Chock-full of stuff I highlighted, this was an easy, interesting read. Just like any other ""social psych"" book, many of the principles/lessons are obvious but it's not till you see it on paper that you realise it's something that you should be doing because it makes so much sense.I wish I had read it earlier. Who knows how useful it would have been in.. life? Haha. But anyways, better late than never and I'm glad to have read it only now because then I can match it to the people and examples I see at work. There is more context and I better appreciate the examples he has listed. In any case, it's one of those books worth a re-read every once in a while."
"1433",1432,"Melih Onvural","This book is good because it gives clear frameworks to follow in good times and in bad when dealing with people. It isn't just theoretical. The stories are great as well. "
"1437",1436,"Prima","It gives you the right advice. It's just how the advice is put into action."
"1438",1437,"Elle Esse"," link to original postThis book has been popular for a long while now. And because it is so well written, I gave it 2 out of 5 stars. My problem is that everything in this book is pretty much common sense, and, if anything, I was saddened that society needs self-improvement books like this in the first place. In all honesty, if you think you need this book, what you really need is a kick in the behind and a reality check. Look inside yourself and you ca save money on buying this book. Such a disappointment as I heard so many great things about this book. "
"1439",1438,"Lesley","Great to finally finish this book! Although quite a few of the stories are dated, this book is full of sound advice."
"1445",1444,"Laura Ellison","None of the concepts were completely new to me but the anecdotal examples were very beneficial to see how the concepts were put to use in real life scenarios. I felt some of the material was dated since it was written in the 30s but many of the principles still apply today. I would love to read an updated version of the book that takes into account technology, the credit card culture, online dating and social media. I also hated how simplistic and naive the section on mental illness was and would be fine if they deleted that section. Overall it was a very good book with good tips and techniques for how to present yourself and converse well with others."
"1446",1445,"Arnab Mukherjee","This book describes how to communicate effectively. The methods described are useful and will surely get you benefits.It actually provokes you to think before speaking. In my opinion if you approach these methods eventually you will reap the benefits. You should read it once for sure."
"1447",1446,"Andriyani","Very implementable in daily lifes"
"1450",1449,"Brenden Anklam","A book everyone should not only read, but implement into their lives. "
"1451",1450,"Matt Morrison","Easy and entertaining read with lots if value. Looking forward to reviewing it periodically going forward."
"1452",1451,"Shaher's Spirit","As a matter of fact i think its a very good one, But i think it was more useful in the past than now, People has changed now .A worthy book to read though."
"1455",1454,"Nun","seandainya aq menguasai 60% saja dari buku ini, huhuhuhu..."
"1457",1456,"Zenah","I am really, really anti self-help books, but when I was out of things to read, I found this on a shelf at home, and thought ""ah, let's see what these self-righteous people have to say"". But when I read it, I really liked it. On the most part, I can say it was intuitive to me, because I've always had a sense of self when dealing with others. But the book helps point out dealing-with-people skills in a very well organized manner, and through very interesting historical anecdotes. It's a great feel for social skills and I thoroughly enjoyed it. "
"1458",1457,"Peggy","It has been awhile since I read this book but it was good."
"1459",1458,"Chris AtLee","Don't be put off by the slightly Machiavellian title. This book is about making the most of your interactions with others. It has lots of great tips about dealing with complaints, handling arguments and the best way to give somebody criticism."
"1460",1459,"Viet Thao","Mommy made me read this when I was really young, primary school I think (evident lack of tactfulness on my side maybe? haha). Anyway this is one of the non-fiction staples. It is very to the point, convincing and effective."
"1463",1462,"Nabil Dabbagh","Brilliant.Carnegie eloquently and vividly shows us how flawed we are as humans, but also shines a direct spotlight on how easily rectifiable our imperfections can be. Though his examples verge towards unrealistic fiction at times, he shows his true skills as a storyteller when sharing these small anecdotes with us. ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" is an easy read which should be considered by all - businessperson or not - as there's great value in learning how to be kind, genuine, empathetic human beings."
"1466",1465,"Zara","Nice read, useful stuff, clear, precise presentation."
"1468",1467,"Dana","I felt so strongly that everyone should read this book that I let a friend -- ex-work husband Tim -- borrow this book. Yeah, he never returned it. It's a quick read."
"1469",1468,"Zach Amberbud","The book tells you how to correct things that the most of the people are exercising. "

"1474",1473,"Marni Boynton","I picked this up 20 years ago and I still read it every year, time to buy a copy. The zest you need, when feeling tired, old, stale and in need of a boost."
"1479",1478,"Lori Grant","A should-read book on improving your business communication skills."
"1480",1479,"S'hi","Following the instructions in the on how to get the most out of this book, I read each chapter then re-read it before proceeding. I was also attending an NLP Practitioner’s Course, reading the chapters on the bus to and from the venue. It is surprising how much the learnings of each overlapped.Yet what surprised me more was the examples of people who knew these principles yet failed to stick with them.So I became more acutely aware of my own need to practice the examples given in this book if I was to really benefit from it and build up my own consistency.In some ways it is remarkable that one book could contain so much and yet people write their own lesser versions. However, I now realize this is their own practice “in the world” of the principles put forth by Dale Carnegie. Rather than write a whole book, we tend now to write a variety of articles which play out the principles in different situations. Some people then gather them together into a book. But essentially Dale Carnegie’s version differs because it was his own central storage of his own learning and practice. He constantly revised and improved it and kept it as a live project, rather than a completed collection.This approach is that of the Mechanic profile in Talent Dynamics. Beginning with a systematic approach to situations and constantly revising and improving them. Even though Carnegie was dealing with people, he was doing so with a very deliberate task and purpose in mind. His teaching of people was almost a secondary benefit in his own mind to the system he was developing for himself to improve his own skills. The people he taught were part of his feedback to test his own competency.It is the level to which Dale Carnegie took these practices and applied them which has made his book such a classic for anyone to learn from over time. Read the more modern versions, but go back to this master as well. "
"1481",1480,"Graham","Common sense advice from the pioneer of self-help. I would recommend to anyone."
"1482",1481,"Priscilla","I am re-reading this."
"1485",1484,"Ross Chambers","Basically, a good read, and with the over lying message that you need to pay attention to others emotional needs, be interested in them, and that will lead them to have positive feelings towards you. Not revelationary but it's a good dig in the ribs that we must take time to listen and take genuine interest in others."
"1488",1487,"Berry Boen","My dad recommended this book. I was skeptical at first and read it halfheartedly. But then, I stumbled upon a line I read in this book, ""I had the blues because I had no shoes until upon the street, I met a man who had no feet"". Then I was hooked. Nuff said."
"1489",1488,"Patrick Gates","Another great motivational book!! Beeing in Business this book really spoke to me about customer service and like the Title sais influence people. "
"1490",1489,"Surendran","A book that changed the way I interpreted life."
"1491",1490,"Joel Murray","This book is a great reminder on how we should act. The whole book can basically be summarised as ""be nice to other people and try to put yourself in their shoes"". It was first published in 1936 but (most of it) is still very relevant today. There were some good examples of the techniques working and I believe the world would be a better place if people took the advice.The final section on marriage advice was probably relevant to the time, but now appears very dated. It assumes that men and women have pre-defined roles where men go out and work whilst women stay home and cook and clean. His advice is still good, but the gender components should be ignored, as it goes both ways.This book is a good reminder as to how to behave. However, if you're using it as steps to get your own way then it won't work and you've completely missed the point. It is all about sincerity. Carnegie points this out in the final line of the Letters section when he states, ""the principles taught in this book will work only when they come from the heart. I am not advocating a bag of tricks. I am talking about a new way of life."""

"1498",1497,"Matt Gwynn","There is a reason that this book has been so well known for so many years. I learned many things regarding interacting with people. I learned about how to develop relationships with people as well as some of the common pitfalls to avoid that can destroy those relationships."

"1501",1500,"Katie Q","This is a must have on the bookshelf. I find it a bit much to read in one hit.It is one of those books you read as you need to read it - that way it sinks in better and works for what you need now."
"1502",1501,"Robert Dahlen","One of the original self help books.Great at the time, much better books out now."
"1503",1502,"Polly","I really enjoyed this book. As usual Mr.Carnegie using great tone and amazing analogies to get their point across. This book is not about getting friends. It's about understanding the different personalities and thought processes of the people around you.Great read. "
"1505",1504,"Jeremy Couch","It's a great book and classic for personal communication. It does get a bit too repetitive toward the second half and it seems there was pressure to have a certain number of chapters because later in the book many chapters are only a few pages and some only 1 page."
"1507",1506,"Katy Higgins","very important to read "
"1509",1508,"Rory","A lot of this book seems like common sense, but it is an excellent manual for managing and dealing with people. It's an easy read, and I will plan on reading it again. "
"1512",1511,"Ibrahim Almsmary","Awesome !!!"
"1513",1512,"Trunal Vinerkar","In this book the author illustrates different principles which can help to improve and be a better person, citing examples of many great people in history. The book is slow but the author has done a great job in expressing his ideas.One of the quote which I will always remember is ""Judge not, that ye be not judged""."
"1515",1514,"Gitte","We live in a hasty society where we do not really listen to each other anymore. We tend to bluff and only show our superficial façade that we generated throughout the years. In negotiations we want to win whatever is at stake and in times of social networking we know more people than ever before but paradoxically we are growing more socially isolated. With this book Dale Carnegie shows us that we need to connect more to one another. He displays all the essential social skills to establish and cement good relationships, whether they are private or professional. Friendliness, listening, empathy, constructive feedback and smiling are just a few of his tips and tricks to win friends and influence people. So if you would like to read the nice stories that he uses to clarify his theory and you would like to upgrade your people skills that will make you stand out even more in a crowd, I am glad to recommend you this book. "
"1517",1516,"Saraelizabeth","Great book about interacting with people. i thought it would be about manipulation, and was wary, but it turned out to be great."
"1520",1519,"Shreedhar Manek","This book was a fairly interesting read, albeit a little conflictive for my inner peace. On the one hand, I think a lot of tips suggested make a superficial person. They stray away from the natural response to situations of a person, to a place eerily close to what we call a people pleaser. On the other hand, it mentions time and again to be sincere and honest with how we deal with people, or else to risk being tagged as pretentious. I guess it all depends in what way one utilises the tips mentioned in the book. One needs to be cautious and careful with this book. Also, I recommend leaving out close friends and relatives with the methods of handling people mentioned in this book, unless absolutely necessary. You'll know you have a great friend if you never need to consult this book because of them."
"1521",1520,"Santhosh  Puligilla","When I saw this book title in my senior book shelf, I felt the content of the book would be flattering. When I read this book recently I felt regret for having bad feeling in the past. Dale explained how to deal each and every aspect of life which we don't even know how it effects. No matter what profession is, you always so many principles in this book which you can apply to any situation in your life."
"1527",1526,"John Ulrich","It took me about 7 months to get through this book. This is not one you read over a weekend for something to do. It is very poignant and if you apply the lessons learned they will take you a long way. I am also partial to such methods as the Sandler system, but this looks at influence and leadership in a slightly different way and is just as valid. This is a book you take notes with, highlight passages, underline paragraphs, mark up...it should look like a school textbook when you are done with it. Although it was written some 80 years ago, the lessons to be learned form this are timeless."
"1528",1527,"Daniella","Believe the hype. This book is great. A lot of people seem to think that this book teaches you how to manipulate people, but if they think that they probably haven't read it. One of the key points of the book is that none of these strategies will work unless you genuinely care about other people, and you want what's best for them. If you have only your best interests in mind, then almost everyone will sense you are insincere and you will fail to achieve genuine influence on all but the most desperate people."
"1531",1530,"Dana Mcclellan","A classic. Although some of the terminology is a little outdated."
"1533",1532,"Jessica Lanan","Like other reviewers, I was surprised to find that I liked this book more than I expected. While it might not be the biggest page-turner ever written, many of the anecdotal examples are amusing and I think the advice could help people."

"1536",1535,"Esther","This book was suggested as a book club pick several years ago. We didn't end up reading it but it pique my interest. Which is one thing I love about book clubs, I'm pretty sure I would never of picked this book up on my own since I thought the title sounded manipulative. But for the most part it wasn""t and I really enjoyed this book. I discovered and started applying (sometimes rediscovered and reasserted efforts to apply) many true principles about how to get along with others mostly based on things like being considerate, respectful, kind, a good listener etc... Don't we all need to be better at those kind of things? Wouldn't the world be better if we each actually took some conscientious effort to be better at those kind of things? So another example of don't judge a book by it's cover (or title in this case). "

"1547",1546,"Adilee","This was a hard one to rate. It is full of useful and helfpul information and good stories, but it's also repetitive and a little dated. In fact, I had no idea it was written in the 1930's! I knew it had been around for a long while, but not that long. I'm glad I finally read it."
"1548",1547,"Ila","Dale Carnegie’s famous, How To Win Friends and Influence People, also known as “The big secret to dealing with people”, is an eye opening book. Before reading this book, you would think you’ve been doing almost everything perfectly when it comes to handling people. It’ll make you think carefully about your actions and make you more self-conscious about what you say and how you treat other people. The purpose of this book is to help people maneuver their way through their different relationships, along with all of the people you come into contact with in a productive way. The book will make you think more about the other person’s perspective whenever you disagree with them. If you’re really genuine about learning how to deal with others, you’ll catch yourself being more aware of how you interact with people. Carnegie mentions that, “He who can do this has the world with him. He who cannot, walks a lonely way,” he is saying that if you can master the tips given to make people like you, winning people to your way of thinking and being a leader, you will have people in the palm of your hands.Carnegie showed no signs of favoritism and was fair throughout the whole book. He considered all point of views a person could possibly have in the different situations addressed in the book. He showed the adverse and typical ways of dealing with situations followed by a positive way to go about things in situations, which ties into one of the many lesson’s Carnegie touched on; don’t criticize, condemn, or complain. Carnegie says,” Instead of condemning people, let’s try to understand them. Try to figure out why they do what they do…This breeds sympathy, tolerance and kindness,” this quote is declaring is that people are going to do things that you don’t agree with, however you should always try to look at things from their point of view instead of being quick to judge or belittle. He gives an example from the life of Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln wrote an insulting letter in his town’s newspaper about another politician. Soon after, the politician found out Lincoln wrote the letter and challenged him to fight in the duel. Luckily, the duel was interrupted and stopped. After that incident, Lincoln never again wrote an insulting letter and he almost never criticized anybody for anything.Overall, the book was well written and organized. Carnegies’ points were straightforward and comprehensive. The points were simple and apparent, yet significant and commonly neglected. He also elaborated on each point and gave specific examples for each. For example, one of the points in the book was to be a good listener and encourage others to talk about themselves. That sounds simple, but people sometimes fail to realize how quick they are to talk about themselves while interacting with others. He also gave examples from the lives of well –known people, which made the book seem more realistic and relatable.Dale Carnegie wrote this book to help people become better at dealing with all types of people and looking at situations from the other person’s point of view. Through the story, he helps the readers to take a second look at how they treat people, and gives them helpful tips on how to improve their relationships with them."
"1549",1548,"Samad","The book shares very good insight into what should be done to build good relationship with people. 2 disadvantages which I did not enjoy: 1) real life examples of old times - you cannot change it, as the book was written 80 years ago, 2) high number of examples to prove the recommendation - I had to skip most of them as they were keeping from reading the book at pace."
"1550",1549,"J.C.","A lot of it seems pretty common sense, but its filled with a lot of anecdotes and other examples that really flesh out the advice and make it insightful. I highlighted the heck out of it and i got yellow sticky tabs throughout the entire book, so hopefully I will someday put some of what I learned to good use. If you're at all interested in this sort of book, then it's probably a good find and will certainly help you. "
"1551",1550,"Mohammad Ali Abedi","“To be interesting, be interested.”The book I read was the revised 80s version. I didn’t know this until I started the book and then I didn’t want to change. Usually, I hate when books are updated. Leave it alone. If you think you have a lot of new ideas, just write a new book. Because between revising the book in the 80s and when it was originally written, it was 50 years, given that the book was written in the 30s. And I wanted to read the original original version.“A person’s toothache means more to that person than a famine in China which kills a million people. A boil on one’s neck interests one more than forty earthquakes in Africa. Think of that the next time you start a conversation.”Because the book, in what appears one of the first self-help book (in the sense of what we know today), is actually great. It is simple, basic, and true, and after 80 years, not much has been improved on, except today’s books make the author seem like some sort of douche. No how idea how current authors do that, but they all write self-help books that seem to have huge subtitles under each page that says, “I AM A DOUCHE”. But this book doesn’t have that.“Better give your path to a dog than be bitten by him in contesting for the right. Even killing the dog would not cure the bite.”I wouldn’t mind rereading the original book again. When reading it, at first I thought, I know all this, but after a while, I thought, I’m not really applying it as much as I want to. A good reminder on what parts I can use. Of course, no book is a blueprint and this one shouldn’t be either. I read reviews on this book from people who claimed it will turn you into a doormat. I think that’s where one has to be intelligent in reading self-help books. One uses the parts that one finds weakness in one’s natural personality, at the same time, building on one’s own unique skillset.And finally, some choice quotes from the book. These are not from the author, but quotes he uses from other famous people, so credit to his choice of quotes, not to his quotes,Publilius Syrus: “We are interested in others when they are interested in us.""-Emerson: “Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him.”-Disraeli: “Talk to people about themselves and they will listen for hours.""-Galileo: ""You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him to find it within.""-Lord Chesterfield (to his son): ""Be wiser than other people if you can; but do not tell them so.""-""In a similar way, General Robert E. Lee once spoke to the president of the Confederacy, Jefferson Davis, in the most glowing terms about a certain officer under his command. Another officer in attendance was astonished. “General,” he said, "" do you not know that the man of whom you speak so highly is one of your bitterest enemies who misses no opportunity to malign you?” ""Yes,"" replied General Lee, “but the president asked my opinion of him; he did not ask for his opinion of me.”""-""By the way, I am not revealing anything new in this chapter. Two thousand years ago, Jesus said: “Agree with thine adversary quickly.”""-""And 2,200 years before Christ was born, King Akhtoi of Egypt gave his son some shrewd advice - advice that is sorely needed today. “Be diplomatic,” counseled the King. “It will help you gain your point.”""-""The Chinese have a proverb pregnant with the age-old wisdom of the Orient: “He who treads softly goes far.”"""

"1562",1561,"Kara","The tips in this book are timeless. The style of speech and the examples, however, were not and might sound a little stilted to our 21st century ears. I would still encourage everyone to read it.Carnegie starts from first impressions and goes all the way through leadership. He explains how to get people to like you and how to get people to do what you need them to do. What he says here is still highly applicable to today's world--amazing, considered this was written in 1936. This is the classic business book for soft skills, and you can see how so many books that came after it can be seen as a variation on Carnegie's original themes. A must read for those who like business non-fiction. I did get the distinct impression that this might just be a long advertisement for the Carnegie classes, but that's all right."
"1563",1562,"Melita","Carnegie's book is pretty good advice if you want to work in business, especially in sales, as well as in other workplaces. The title for the book about 'friends' could be misleading for some people though as it is not really about making friends socially."
"1565",1564,"Ryan Ray","2nd time through it. Lots of good nuggets. "
"1567",1566,"Emi Markovska","I should have read this book way earlier, as one thing is sure - it certainly made me/will make me a better person.The title is somewhat pretentious, but don't get fooled by it. The book is all about dealing with people in a good way. Treating them good and being full of understanding, no matter the situation. They will be happy and you will more likely benefit from it.I was not fond of the examples supporting his arguments, and on times, there were just so many of them, but other than that this book seemed like a helpful ""manual"". Being a good communicator is never out-of-date. I hope applying some of the advice, I will generally improve my communication skills and then start building my own success stories."

"1570",1569,"Jenny ","I read this book in 1998 with a group from work. We would read a chapter a week, then watch part of a video series. All of us got promotions that year. "
"1571",1570,"Natalie G","Greer classic, it becomes a bit redundant at one points but the message is clear and effective."
"1572",1571,"Gry Ranfelt","Excellent points in this book about how to manage people and your own manners. Get ready to be genuinely interested in other people, to put on good manners and to set down your own ego to make others feel special. Get ready to learn how to ignore the need for credibility and achieve progress instead by letting others get the ideas.This book will teach you to give space for others to become your friends and will encourage you to think in terms of other people's interests. There are also a LOT of interesting anecdotal stories, but you don't necessarily need to read all of them.One note: This is an old book and so has some pretty sexist statements for today's time about marriage. It assumes women are nagging (and gives no example of men nagging) and so adresses its chapter ""don't nag"" entirely to women, and also writes as though intellectual achievements are solely a male need. (In my short life I've definitely experienced nagging men. Probably more nagging women than men, but it's not as black and white as he portrays.) He even encourages women to lay down their own need to excel to stroke their husband's ego because he needs a calm house to come home to after a long day at work.Obviously we're a lot more diverse in our thinking today, know that both men and women have a need to excel and have their egos stroked.Ignoring that one chapter, which, in spite of a little bit of sexism, was still right that nagging is bad, this is an excellent book."

"1577",1576,"Darren Brown","A 'classic' in the leadership genre, I expected a lot from this book and was only a little disappointed. The entirety of the book can more or less be summed up in the words ""be selfless, and mindful of others"". Many of the 'principles' were variations on a theme instead of being distinct leadership principles. All told, it is still a must for the readers of leadership/management genre."
"1578",1577,"Kendell","One of those classics I've always heard about and wanted to read. Sometimes these types of books can get a little boring, but Carnegie uses plenty of examples and interesting stories to keep you interested."
"1579",1578,"Samantha","Very insightful, still applicable today"
"1581",1580,"Esterch","This is a handbook about human relations.Each chapter explains a fundamental principle for building and maintaining a good relationship with others. Carnegie uses a great deal of short stories of successful people to illustrate these principles to show how they really work. I found many of the stories really inspiring, but some of them didn't seem very relevant.A lot of the principles in this book are principles we already know or have heard of. Honestly, I was hoping to read about techniques I've never heard of, but I felt like I was reading the obvious.On the other hand, it was silly of me not to expect ""the obvious"". We all already have an idea of what makes good and bad relationships, isn't it common sense? However, we often miss to see the obvious clearly, we don't give it too much thought, and we often forget to apply these obvious principles when the time comes to deal with people. Carnegie tries to make us see these principles in a clearer way and also the benefits their application can bring us.While some people might find some of the techniques manipulative or only helpful to build fake relationships based on personal interests, I shall argue that Carnegie emphasizes many times the sincerity one should have while putting those techniques into action. And truth is all relationships are based on some sort of interest. This book, more than anything, tries to form good habits in us and it serves as a reminder of how to deal with people in a successful way. You definitely won't be wasting your time if you choose to read it."
"1584",1583,"Ziyad Khesbak","A book with contents both illuminating and comically obvious in hindsight. Despite its unfortunate marketable title, which suggests a duplicity that is the antithesis of the authors intent, this collection of personal and historical antidotes is a remarkably interesting book which ought to be requisite reading for any human being who plans on existing on a planet with other human beings. That's most of you. The book sums to the golden rule. However, if one would do unto others as he would want to have done to himself, it is important to know oneself, what one would want, and (by easy generalization) human nature in general. In this dual way, Carnegie informs us not only about others but about ourselves. Classic."
"1585",1584,"Ramanujam","This is a very old book, but several of the tips contained in this book are very relevant even in today's world.This can help improving relationships, communication with colleagues and reduce friction arising from ego clashes at workplace."

"1591",1590,"Saikhnaa Ch","Planning to reread It in English due to work reason. "
"1592",1591,"Jacob Santos","This is a book that you can't simply read and then put down to never revisit. It is like the Art of War, you need to think about the ideas and how they could be applied and attempt to apply them. Sometimes the lessons are hidden in the subtext and at least for someone like me, it was difficult to parse out the meanings or what I was supposed to take from each chapter.It isn't that the book is obtuse. I think many normal people could take a lot out of it. I think people like me should study it and use it as a bible for how to interact with people. Treating people with respect should be simple, but the means and reasons are not. Interacting with people is often complex and while some people have an innate ability and charisma when interacting with people. Others are not so blessed.The concept described in the book should be simple, but reads like the Design of Things. The purpose is to go through what I'll describe as scenarios or examples where the concepts are applied and discussed. It is more like a workshop or classroom. If there was a teacher then the person would have given some idea as to the message of each chapter. You could or should come to some conclusion by thinking about each chapter. It is part of the reason that it is a book that may need to be reread time and time again.It is part of a collection on how to not be an asshole and how to handle people. People are complex or at least appear complex. Part of that is that the motivations are often not clear and this book serves to provide some clarity to what those motivations are."
"1594",1593,"Ki Chung","This book is one of those books that everyone should have a copy of. The content may seem little repeating and obvious to some people, but I found this book to be a great piece to read."
"1595",1594,"Yulia","Transformative book. If you seek self-improvement, shorten your want-to-read list and check out this classic first. I avoided it for over a decade, despite having majored in psychology, because I interpreted the title as suggesting it was a how-to on manipulating others and being false in the corporate world. But it is far from this. It teaches you to always put others first and effect change in others by first changing how you approach others (with humility, respect and close listening) and then guiding them to want to change to benefit themselves. This approach has been restated countless times in modern self-help books on marriage, parenting, business success, and negotiation, and is rooted in psychology research, spiritual teaching and the lives of great leaders. But instead of being lecturing and admonishing, Carnegie engages you with true stories that show the inspiration for and application of his techniques. And he puts you at ease by pointing out how far he has come from his early years, giving hope to even the most awkward or ill-spoken. Dale Carnegie might not seem the most compelling life coach for readers in a digital age, but his lessons, gathered from centuries of others' learning, prove to be surprisingly relevant and enduring. It's also interesting to learn the back stories of corporate titans and US presidents, humanizing them and putting their later successes in context. The lessons may be repetitive in the middle third of the book, but press on to the final section, where Carnegie teaches you how to deal with conflict. It's an issue I've long struggled with, but find much more easy to remedy than I'd ever imagined. It is possible to learn tact and diplomacy (well, I'm trying). This was a revelation to me, she with foot in mouth. "
"1598",1597,"Leslie Ann","A breezy and useful book on improving human relationships. I think this book should be required reading for the U.S. Congress. The book is packed with anecdotes about famous and not-so-famous people (e.g., folks that took Carnegie's course) that illustrate how to make people like you, win them over to your way of thinking, and change them without arousing resentment. The tips are variations on these fundamental principles, which are themselves an expansion of the Golden Rule (keeping in mind that everyone wants to feel important):1. Don't criticise, condemn, or complain.2. Give honest and sincere appreciation.3. Arouse an eager want in the other person. "
"1600",1599,"Charlene"," How to Win Friends & Influence People  is an insightful, practical, effective and enjoyable book that (I believe) can make a positive impact in everyone's daily life. Though all of the principles suggested in this book appear overly simplistic, in practice, it can be quite a challenge (as it is not the norm, in my opinion). I would recommend this book to anyone that has tried to change to their situation at work, at home, anywhere, with anyone and not been successful. The principles suggested in this book might be a refreshing change and ultimately, get you what you want. "
"1602",1601,"Andrew Ashby","Classic book that everyone should read."
"1604",1603,"Mallie","Really good reminders about how to treat people. Carnegie describes most of ""winning friends and influencing people"" as treating them with kindness, respect and dignity. All the examples were so dated (the book was originally written in 1936) but that almost made the overarching principles ring more true.Favorite quotations:""Even in such technical lines as engineering, about 15 percent of one’s financial success is due to one’s technical knowledge and about 85 percent is due to skill in human engineering—to personality and the ability to lead people.""I believe it!“The great aim of education,” said Herbert Spencer, “is not knowledge but action.”On the futility of criticism:""Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself. Criticism is dangerous, because it wounds a person’s precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment.""""Criticisms are like homing pigeons. They always return home. Let’s realize that the person we are going to correct and condemn will probably justify himself or herself, and condemn us in return.""Lincoln on criticism:""One of his favorite quotations was “Judge not, that ye be not judged.” And when Mrs. Lincoln and others spoke harshly of the southern people, Lincoln replied: “Don’t criticize them; they are just what we would be under similar circumstances.”""Benjamin Franklin, tactless in his youth, became so diplomatic, so adroit at handling people, that he was made American Ambassador to France. The secret of his success? “I will speak ill of no man,” he said, “. . . and speak all the good I know of everybody.” Any fool can criticize, condemn and complain—and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving.""On getting people to do what you want:""There is only one way under high heaven to get anybody to do anything. Did you ever stop to think of that? Yes, just one way. And that is by making the other person want to do it. Remember, there is no other way.""“I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people,” said Schwab, “the greatest asset I possess, and the way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement. “There is nothing else that so kills the ambitions of a person as criticisms from superiors. I never criticize anyone. I believe in giving a person incentive to work. So I am anxious to praise but loath to find fault. If I like anything, I am hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise.“In my wide association in life, meeting with many and great people in various parts of the world,” Schwab declared, “I have yet to find the person, however great or exalted his station, who did not do better work and put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than he would ever do under a spirit of criticism.”""Tomorrow you may want to persuade somebody to do something. Before you speak, pause and ask yourself: “How can I make this person want to do it?”""If out of reading this book you get just one thing—an increased tendency to think always in terms of other people’s point of view, and see things from their angle—if you get that one thing out of this book, it may easily prove to be one of the building blocks of your career.""On making friends:""If we want to make friends, let’s put ourselves out to do things for other people—things that require time, energy, unselfishness and thoughtfulness.""***""People rarely succeed at anything unless they have fun doing it.""Importance of names:""We should be aware of the magic contained in a name and realize that this single item is wholly and completely owned by the person with whom we are dealing . . . and nobody else. The name sets the individual apart; it makes him or her unique among all others. The information we are imparting or the request we are making takes on a special importance when we approach the situation with the name of the individual. From the waitress to the senior executive, the name will work magic as we deal with others.Having good conversations:""So if you aspire to be a good conversationalist, be an attentive listener. To be interesting, be interested. Ask questions that other persons will enjoy answering. Encourage them to talk about themselves and their accomplishments. Remember that the people you are talking to are a hundred times more interested in themselves and their wants and problems than they are in you and your problems.""""There is one all-important law of human conduct. If we obey that law, we shall almost never get into trouble. In fact, that law, if obeyed, will bring us countless friends and constant happiness. But the very instant we break the law, we shall get into endless trouble. The law is this: Always make the other person feel important. John Dewey, as we have already noted, said that the desire to be important is the deepest urge in human nature; and William James said: “The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.” As I have already pointed out, it is this urge that differentiates us from the animals. It is this urge that has been responsible for civilization itself.""""The unvarnished truth is that almost all the people you meet feel themselves superior to you in some way, and a sure way to their hearts is to let them realize in some subtle way that you recognize their importance, and recognize it sincerely. Remember what Emerson said: “Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him.”On changing minds:""If a person makes a statement that you think is wrong—yes, even that you know is wrong—isn’t it better to begin by saying: “Well, now, look. I thought otherwise, but I may be wrong. I frequently am. And if I am wrong, I want to be put right. Let’s examine the facts.” There’s magic, positive magic, in such phrases as: “I may be wrong. I frequently am. Let’s examine the facts.”""We sometimes find ourselves changing our minds without any resistance or heavy emotion, but if we are told we are wrong, we resent the imputation and harden our hearts. We are incredibly heedless in the formation of our beliefs, but find ourselves filled with an illicit passion for them when anyone proposes to rob us of their companionship. It is obviously not the ideas themselves that are dear to us, but our self-esteem which is threatened. . . . The little word “my” is the most important one in human affairs, and properly to reckon with it is the beginning of wisdom. It has the same force whether it is “my” dinner, “my” dog, and “my” house, or “my” father, “my” country, and “my” God.""""Any fool can try to defend his or her mistakes—and most fools do—but it raises one above the herd and gives one a feeling of nobility and exultation to admit one’s mistakes.""""When we are right, let’s try to win people gently and tactfully to our way of thinking, and when we are wrong—and that will be surprisingly often, if we are honest with ourselves—let’s admit our mistakes quickly and with enthusiasm. Not only will that technique produce astonishing results; but, believe it or not, it is a lot more fun, under the circumstances, than trying to defend oneself. Remember the old proverb: “By fighting you never get enough, but by yielding you get more than you expected.”""In talking with people, don’t begin by discussing the things on which you differ. Begin by emphasizing—and keep on emphasizing—the things on which you agree. Keep emphasizing, if possible, that you are both striving for the same end and that your only difference is one of method and not of purpose. Get the other person saying “Yes, yes” at the outset. Keep your opponent, if possible, from saying “No.”""Wouldn’t you like to have a magic phrase that would stop arguments, eliminate ill feeling, create good will, and make the other person listen attentively? Yes? All right. Here it is: “I don’t blame you one iota for feeling as you do. If I were you I would undoubtedly feel just as you do.”On sympathy::Dr. Arthur I. Gates said in his splendid book Educational Psychology: “Sympathy the human species universally craves. The child eagerly displays his injury; or even inflicts a cut or bruise in order to reap abundant sympathy. For the same purpose adults . . . show their bruises, relate their accidents, illness, especially details of surgical operations. ‘Self-pity’ for misfortunes real or imaginary is, in some measure, practically a universal practice.”On showmanship:""This is the day of dramatization. Merely stating a truth isn’t enough. The truth has to be made vivid, interesting, dramatic. You have to use showmanship. The movies do it. Television does it. And you will have to do it if you want attention.""And this was 1936!""It is always easier to listen to unpleasant things after we have heard some praise of our good points.""""Asking questions not only makes an order more palatable; it often stimulates the creativity of the persons whom you ask. People are more likely to accept an order if they have had a part in the decision that caused the order to be issued.""""Let us praise even the slightest improvement. That inspires the other person to keep on improving.""""“Praise is like sunlight to the warm human spirit; we cannot flower and grow without it. And yet, while most of us are only too ready to apply to others the cold wind of criticism, we are somehow reluctant to give our fellow the warm sunshine of praise.”""one of the important rules of human relations: Always make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.""FUNDAMENTAL TECHNIQUES IN HANDLING PEOPLEPRINCIPLE 1Don’t criticize, condemn or complain.

"1627",1626,"Kerstin","Lovely writing style, and the examples and illustrations show just how timeless this subject matter is."
"1628",1627,"David Martschinske","Usually every good business book is also a good book on parenting. With that said, this is a great book on parenting... And business, marriage, church, and really any situation that involves interaction with other living creatures. It's nothing revolutionary in what it says, but it gives you subtle reminders to do the things you know you should be doing. I will criticize less, praise others more, empathize better, and respond with more tact after reading this book for the now second time through. It fits perfectly in the theme of books I've been reading lately which is social psychology. "
"1629",1628,"Bill","Great!"
"1631",1630,"David Robins","This is the classic, and I finally got around to reading it. Good, down to earth advice, and helped along by some great stories. Easy to read and not to be missed."
"1632",1631,"Luiz Guilherme","It's a must read for some one looking to improve how to deal with people. Some examples on the book are exaggerated and does not sounds that real."
"1634",1633,"Dan Graham","This is a great read and probably a should-read for most professionals."
"1638",1637,"Taylor","At the advice of my grandfather, a must-read for everyone involved with people. "
"1641",1640,"Ali Mohsin","There is no denying that the book contains truly remarkable advice which could not only help people to make friends and influence people, but also to make this a better place. But throughout the book, too much words and arguments are wasted on explaining specific ideas."
"1645",1644,"Barb","I have always liked Dale Carnegie's material. This one makes sense. Most people probably know most of the this stuff but just forget to use it. It's mostly about listening and respecting other people and show them you are truely interested in them, and not nodding just to ""get it over with"". "
"1646",1645,"Andy Iverson","The thing that stuck with me after reading this book is how important it is to fully consider the people you are talking to. I had forgotten to care about other people. I have been trying to win friends by being impressive and interesting, but reading this book made me re-realize that the best way to get people to like you is to like them. Find them interesting. Genuinely care about their life. They'll appreciate it."
"1647",1646,"Dude-von Dudenstein","a really good summarisation of things to consider when dealing with people in personal and professional life. The anecdotes in the book are old but still quite relevant especially the ones quoted from a personal context."
"1651",1650,"Ted Zayka","Carnegie's book is a ""must-read"" for anyone working in business, dealing with people, or for those who simply want to become more adept at personal inter-relations. He writes in a very simple, easy to read style, and the book is replete with personal anecdotes which both emphasize his many points, while at the same time keeping the flow and pacing fresh, lively, and relevant. This is the kind of book you want to highlight, keep on your shelf, and refer back to frequently. "
"1656",1655,"Debayan Ghosh Dastidar","I feel this is a book for anyone wishing to have good communication skills. It has a lot of steps mentioned. It becomes difficult to remember so many steps. But it is revolving around some basic steps like appreciation, listening, courtesy and some more. It tells you to avoid criticism and pinpointing wrongdoings directly at maximum occasions. This is a must read for any sales and marketing person who wants to speak in terms of the buyer."
"1657",1656,"Shelby Sullivan","Filled with lots of interesting anecdotes, but nothing too ground-breaking. A must read for all Type A's out there ;) "
"1658",1657,"Catsar","Great book for start in self improvement"
"1661",1660,"Natty"," I found this book very interesting and I enjoyed it more than I thought I would There are lots of tips that can be used today in both business and in ones personal life "
"1663",1662,"Kathy Hickman","Makes complete sense in every decadeThink less of yourself and more of others"
"1666",1665,"Anthony","A classic. Some recommendations seem very obvious, yet people still don't do them. A good read for those interested in personal communication, psychology, and business."
"1667",1666,"Yaroslav","It's a classics, with all the pluses and minuses implied."
"1669",1668,"Lavinia Petrache","This book teaches you how, when interacting with people, you should think less about ""me, me, me"", and try and focus more on the other person. This is something that I forget most of the times, and this book taught me to be a little bit more considerate about the other person's thoughts, judge less, and, most importantly, admit more that even if I'm right, this doesn't make the other person be wrong.It's mostly a book that teaches about tolerance, diplomacy and being friendly, suggests that you give more honest compliments, smile more often and have more empathy towards others. I saved lots of notes from this book, and I will surely go back to read them again from time to time."
"1672",1671,"Bryan","This is a manual on how to be a ""people person"". Reading it is like having a wise grandfather nudge you oh-so-gently into being a better and more pleasant human being. Carnegie's style is clear, conversational, and filled with anecdotes."
"1673",1672,"Gnarmac","Lots of common sense. Most people would benefit from reading this. The basic message is this; be nice, and your life will work out a little better."
"1674",1673,"Willem Myburgh","Great read and really makes you re-evaluate how you interact with other people. "
"1675",1674,"Jcristianolima","Minhas ações pessoais melhoraram depois de conhecer as instruções desse livro"
"1677",1676,"Glenn Hunter","Finally read this classic! Its timeless wisdom is simply brilliant. Unsurprisingly, many professional development concepts have their roots in this work."
"1679",1678,"Austin","Classic for a reason. These are simple concepts that go a long way. The thinking behind Carnegie's work here may be hard for one to adjust to, but what you will find through the course of this text is that there is mileage left in kindness and sincere approbation. ""Be lavish in your praise"" and giving others the spotlight, to make another feel important, even for a few moments, listening emaptheically, is very often rewarded with surprising leaps in cooperation, sour grapes into sumptuous wine."
"1680",1679,"Caryn","This classic has been on my To Read list for a long time. I was recently inspired to pick it up because of an article I read on Book Riot. A woman with Asperger’s wrote that this book was a life-changing tool for her, helping her understand people in a way that she struggled to do on her own. I found this book to be much more relevant than I expected from something written in the 1930s. Many are lessons I’ve picked up as I’ve matured, but it was cool to see it written here. I now wonder if I've indirectly learned from this source, considering how influential it is, nearly rising to the level of modern common sense. A lot of this advice will stick with me, when it comes to work and personal relationships."
"1684",1683,"Helena","I read this book as a freshman in high school and it really changed the way I look at life. Many of the suggestions come naturally to some people, but for me it was a real eye-opener. I would recommend this book to anyone trying to improve their basic personal relations skills."
"1685",1684,"Kartik Singhal","Full of useful advice to develop good interpersonal relations. Must read it again after some time to see how much I could gain from it."
"1687",1686,"Bill Williams","There was a distant era when common sense was more or less, well, common. How to Win Friends and Influence People is like a lost dispatch from that long ago time. It is complete with delightfully archaic second-hand testimonials from people like Ebenezer Whooping Cough of the Long Island Buggy-Whip Company. A star of Sharknado 2 named Wil Wheaton boiled the book down to a core statement, Don't Be a Dick.The book does contain some basic truths about listening, kindness and consideration. Those notes should ring true in any era."
"1688",1687,"Devan Lipsey","To summarize, 'be positive and non-confrontational'. There was something comforting in reading this book, that sense of nostalgia, that sort of '... things were sure simpler back then yet still never change' feel to the anecdotes. It's the kind of feeling you get when you see an old, black and white news reel. Every example of 'Joe, a Department Head at Acme Inc.' reminded me of the office in the movie, 'The Apartment' - those neatly aligned rows of desks each with a typewriter and the same neatly dressed worker bees. Anyway, I think the advise was worthy and I plan to review the points and try to follow them. "
"1693",1692,"Chris Bray","I have read this numerous times, but it is always a good read and reminder"
"1694",1693,"Linda","Weltherrschaft."
"1697",1696,"Kyle Nicholas","A good book full of timeless wisdom, yet obviously written for a different era. If only schools taught these rules of thumb in human relationships instead of the self-esteem movement!"
"1700",1699,"Jorge","Giving shit about people is the key here."
"1701",1700,"Laurent le Beau-Martin","Very interesting read. I can see why this is considered a classic. Each chapter is centered around a principle that can help with social interactions. Using interesting anecdotes, Dale Carnegie shows the value of these principles and how they can be applied.I am very happy I got around to reading this book. I am so convinced of the value of the principles included in this book, that I will make sure to read again this book every few years to remind myself of them."
"1702",1701,"Oscar Sanchez","Timeless classic. Spot on about human nature and relationships, both business and personal. "
"1703",1702,"Santhosh","This is a good book with good concepts. This book has simple concepts which will indeed create a master quality personality if followed genuinely. This is a book for people. It's not about being cruel or admitting you are a nerd; it's about how to get along with people. I don’t think the title is what the book is all about but the concepts of this book is over rated. One quote I like the most from the book is Don't be afraid of enemies who attack you. Be afraid of the friends who flatter you. This book is a Timeless classic, well worth the read. I’d give this book a 4 stars."
"1704",1703,"Jared Janes","must read for everyone"
"1706",1705,"Josh Morris","A timeless business classic. This book should be required reading for every adult. All of the philosophies in this book are relevant (maybe even more so) in our modern times. My only issue with this book is the dialog used to make points - some of it has not aged well and could do with a revision.Worth a read or two."
"1708",1707,"Manoj","Extraordinary !! Though this book was written in early 1930's or may be before but the authors understanding of human behavior and their apt nature is astonishing. The ways to overcome such issues and how will one can influence others are remarkable.Some techniques I've already applied and those were fruitful but some techniques I found were old-fashioned. People may not respond well after attempting these techniques.Still I enjoyed reading the fruitful short stories and I must say this book have really bring positivity in me."
"1709",1708,"James Davis","I think of it as sesame street for adults. The book covers topics like -- put yourself in others' shoes, don't insult people, smile, etc. Having said that, it's a compelling read and a good reminder of basic communication skills."
"1711",1710,"Santhoshi Srilaya","If everyone read this book, we would have a much gentler and understanding society."
"1713",1712,"JR Snow","This book is a bestselling classic for a reason-the principles taught really work. The sum of the book is this: To better lead, change, and influence people, you must make them feel important. The rest of the book is an extrapolation of that, how to make people feel important. Giving sincere praise, admitting your own mistakes when your trying to point out something in a person you want to change, etc. The book is very helpful. "
"1714",1713,"Tyler Allen","No matter your age, profession, or stage in life i think everyone should read this book. So much good advice on how to deal with people. Everything in here makes so much sense and really helps to give some insight into what makes some more successful than others. Definitely recommend."
"1718",1717,"Edna","A well written book. Enjoyed reading it..."
"1720",1719,"Devraj","Not many things in this world would stand true after almost a century. This is one of those books where the thoughts and ideas still remain pertinent to this day. According to me, every college student should read this book, if not present in their curriculum. This book teaches us how to really face the challenges of the corporate world and remain influential to get your ideas and thoughts through. "
"1721",1720,"Lisa King","There are several ways to read this book one of which is that in essence, human beings are a self-involved race. We like to hear the sound of our own name and don’t care much about anything else unless it affects us directly. Another way is that people are generally good but sometimes we need to be carefully made aware of other avenues that benefit not just themselves, but someone else as well.Two sides, one coin. Smile. Don’t talk about you, talk about them and how your idea/product etc. will benefit them. There are many principles that Dale Carnegie lists after each major portion of this book. All principles are sound and there is a reason that this book has been in print for so long. Do yourself a favour and read this book if you are having problems dealing with people in general. If nothing else, it is good food for thought."
"1722",1721,"Rose Blum ","Still effective after all these years!!!!!"
"1723",1722,"Roberto Estreitinho","Frequently over-idealistic to the point of being kind of naive, but nevertheless a great read full of good stories and insights."
"1724",1723,"Praveen Pundeer","Very nice book with very practical ideas on human relations.."
"1725",1724,"Tirth Shah","A great work by Mr. Carnegie. The heart of the principle is the examples given by Mr. Carnegie it will encourage you to the level that you should apply this to your day to day life. a great and a must read book for the people who relates with any professional courses. I highly recommend it to my family and friends. and and it will surely transform you to some level."

"1733",1732,"Stef","Truly valuable advice for introverts. Gives you tools to hack the fuzzy humans."
"1736",1735,"Ramzi","Carnegie is the best without a shadow of a doubt, His simplicity, relevance and technique really helps us to go deep in to the subject of building human connections."
"1737",1736,"Lucka","While reading the book I was thinking about five since some of the ideas sounded really great. An instant cookbok for everyone who needs to influence people. But then I thought about it again and found out the magic was gone. The principles presented are not that bad but the stories presented sound like from 100 years ago and it is hard to believe they could still happen nowadays.And this is probably the biggest issue I have with the book: It is focused on great impression and assumes you want to make the best first impression all the time. But would you rather have hundreds of people who admire you for a single act or a couple of real friends who like you for who you truly are?Even thought my comments may sound negative, I highly recommend reading this book."
"1739",1738,"Christopher  Waugh","I read this some years ago; and it really is a helpful read for business professionals. "
"1740",1739,"Robert Lee","This was a really helpful book when I was an undergrad first living away from home."
"1743",1742,"Uleto","This was pretty good, but the title is misleading. I think a better title would be ""Effectively dealing with colleagues, salespeople, clients and strangers"". Looking at the reviews here on goodreads, they're mostly 5 stars or 1 star. This is a very polarizing book, and I think that's because of the misleading title. The ""friends"" part is wrong. It doesn't really go into what friendship is and how you find people that make good friends. Instead, it's a book full of techniques for more effectively dealing with colleagues, strangers, salespeople, clients, etc. These are people you didn't get to pick. But you still need to interact with them. To put it bluntly, this book sounds like a villain's manual, and it sort of is. But even if you have no nefarious goals I still think it's a worthwhile read.Almost all of the techniques are illustrated with an anecdote that shows someone getting a business deal, or getting subordinates to obey rules and increase productivity, or on getting children to listen. What on earth is friendship? How do you find it? Why is there chemistry between some people, and not with others? This book won't answer those questions. It may help you to get along with people, but whether that leads to friendship remains to be seen.This book did I into the question that I've been pondering for a while. ""If you want others to do something, how convince them to do it?"" There are countless ways of asking someone to do something, some ways work, others don't and some even cause them to do the very opposite. And the only thing that was different is how you asked them. This book is about exactly that. The book is a bit oldfashioned, but since it's from the 1930's, that's to be expected. Believe the book has been edited somewhat for a more modern audience.Do the techniques work? Well, I plan to try them myself but I've only just finished the book, so I can't really say yet.But I have noticed many of the techniques used on me, by salespeople. Have you ever noticed street or door-to-door salespeople start by asking a string of questions to which you will invariably answer ""yes""? That's in the book too. I remember learning about professional feedback techniques: sandwich negative feedback between positive feedback. This book has similar ideas.To sum up: good book, misleading title. How to make friends is still a mystery."

"1757",1756,"Loni","This book had a lot of great ideas and reminders, but way to many examples. I found it ironic as he talked about how over used the word ""I"" is in conversation, yet many examples he started just that way. It is a great thing to think of others feeling and thoughts. Do you know people that all conversations and comments go back to them? This book is for them.. But they likely will not realize it. ;-) "

"1766",1765,"Hiba Shaban","The book is more about how to deal with tough people and how to get people to do what you want them to do without them resenting you. A lot of it was common sense to me but I also learned a few new things. Overall it was interesting reading the stories of people who have tried his advice and how that worked out for them.

Dale's classic book is actually about how to be a decent and respectful person that empathize with others and respect their opinion.As an added bonus, the book's many examples are also a peek into a not so distant past, where industrialization was still a recent memory and the civil war was just a generation away.

"1780",1779,"Tiera","I really enjoyed this book. Although it is self-help and not necessarily a page turner, Dale Carnegie keeps it upbeat and moving. The advice found in the book was very helpful with basic ideas on how to get along with family members, friends, co-workers etc. I did find that about 3/4 of the way through I was feeling a little overloaded with information, but I still think it was worth the read. You pick and choose a few ideas that you want to work on and leave the rest of advice for another day. I would definitely recommend it."

"1782",1781,"Marta","A classic of self-improvement books, with many followers and epigons. It has been written more then 70 years ago, and it is still to be used nowadays. It is smart, not boring, easy to read and it seems it was written with real passion."
"1784",1783,"Nick Dunn","Overall I enjoyed this book and thought there was a lot of good advice in it. It seems that some of the advice is redundant or just a rewording of previous advice. For instance, it's hard to see much of a material difference between4. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.and6. Let the other person do a great deal of the talking.The stories he relates to bolster his points were my favorite part of the book. While many of the names were unknown to me, there are many famous presidents and politicians used as well; if you aren't familiar with their lives, you should still recognize the names."
"1785",1784,"Yue","This is probably the ancestor of all the self help books on interpersonal relationships. I liked it because it made me think a lot, but I won't necessarily memorize and apply every principle he presented in the book. Here's why.First of all, the whole book is devoted to how to make other people think positively of you. It's very anxiety-inducing when you try to impress others and worry about what they think. The examples in this book lead readers to believe that the techniques are failure proof, while as Carnegie himself says in the book, they just increase your chance of success, not guarantee it. So what to do when you apply the principles but still get rejected? Secondly, I can always sense a hint of manipulation as I read it. You try to be kind to people not because you want to lure them into liking you and giving you what you want, but because you care about them genuinely and believe that people are good in general. Working on how to phrase your words alone does not bring you sincere relationships. Respect others as individual human beings, each with a unique history. Learn about and from them. Be honest. Don't take negative feedback personally but see it as an opportunity to grow. These are just the basics, but they are what helps you truly connect to others and be happy with your life."
"1788",1787,"Abi Shandran","I was not too keen on reading this book at first as I thought it was only for those who are socially awkward and have difficulty in making friends- but that could not be further from the truth. Carnegie writes with a no nonsense approach on human relations and how we can all improve our interpersonal relationships. This book is both timeless and life transforming. I will be surprised if there is not a single person out there who could not learn at least one thing from Carnegie, who could not benefit at least slightly from having read this book. "

It also has a good way in the writing.- This book gives an basic insight of people psychology.- It could be serve as basic to know how people think and response to some action in our general live."

"1813",1812,"Chenice","I think this is probably the best self-help book I have ever read. The 'principles'Carnegie suggests are as relevant now as they were when the book was first published in the 50's.My favourite quotes/principles from the book include:1. By criticizing, we do not make lasting changes and often incur resentment2. You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in youA well-written, interesting, authentic and thought-provoking book that is sure to inspire and motivate you."

"1826",1825,"Nolan Tjapkes","How to Win Friends and Influence people by Dale Carnegie is a book about how to make more friends, win more arguements and become a leader. The book began by explaining how to make people like you more. It was summarized into 6 main points like be geninuely interested in other people, smile, and to use peoples names as much as possible. The second section was all about winning an arguement it had 12 major points. They included: trying to avoid arguements in the first place, letting the other person do all the talking, and letting the person figure out what you want themselves. The final section discussed being a leader. It had 9 points that included: begin with praise and appreciation, use encouragement, and talk about your mistakes to the other person. I thought this book was very well written, it used example from famous people in history like President Lincoln, Rockefeller, and Andrew Carnegie. I thought that the use of these examples did alot to convince the readers to believe his points. I would recommend this book to people who want to be leaders someday. Also I would recommend this book to anyone who is trying to make friends. All in all I'd say this book is a worthy book to read for anyone trying to add leadership skills."
"1831",1830,"Suhail Siddiqui","It's certainly an interesting book. I won't necessarily use it to win ""friends"" but it's an important and very relevant reference for everyday corporate politics. It offers some good insights and valuable lessons on leadership traits and plays on human psychology. Read it with an open mind and apply in your own way. "

"1844",1843,"Miguel Miranda","Dale Carnegie's rhetoric arguments on public relations will never be out of date because human nature will never change. His book deserves its title as a timeless best seller. Its eloquently written and states different principles and more than a handful of examples on applying them. I would recommend it to EVERYONE. It will help you as an employee, employer, spouse, salesman, parent, boss, friend, politicians, etc... Basically it will make you an all around better person."
"1846",1845,"Lottie Panebianco","This is an incredible book. I've heard people mention it for years and years and thought the idea of it was so stupid. The way some people talked about it made it seem like it was a book for scoundrels or for socially awkward people. I didn't want to be either, so I didn't want to read it. Finally, a great friend of mine recommended it to me and I started reading it. This is a book for people. It's not about being evil or admitting you're nerdy; it's about how to get along with people. Anyone who ever has problems getting along with people should read this book. I know I do, but this book has completely changed my perspective. This really comes close to a life changing book. The main point of this book is that if you want to have friends and be successful, you should be nice not mean. It sounds so obvious and I thought I was doing it, but now I realize all the mean things that I've done and still do to people when I don't get along with them. As I've read this book (and I'll work hard to do this from now on) I've tried to think more about the other person's perspective when I disagree with them and it helps so much. I've already noticed a change in the way I interact with people. This is a great book. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get along with other people. It's a very humbling yet empowering book."
"1847",1846,"Walter Miller","My only complaint with this book is that due to being written in 1936 it's focussed on very masculine social interactions. Working on the hill I found that  relational aggression  was much more common, and this book doesn't offer any solutions."
"1848",1847,"Sergey Khomyuk","Вот я наконец-то и добрался до широко известного труда Дейла Карнеги ""Как завоёвывать друзей и оказывать влияние на людей"". Карнеги проделал просто колоссальную работу по анализу самых разнообразных материалов, связанных с социальными навыками, разобрал причины успешности многих выдающихся исторических личностей и свел воедино все полученные им данные в этой книге.Всего в книге можно выделить 3 основные тематические части и бонус про семейную жизнь:Как ""завоевывать"" друзей (быть внимательным к человеку, проявлять искренний интерес к его увлечениям и достижениям, как можно чаще обращаться к человеку по имени, ...)Как убеждать людей (стараться избегать споров, избегать противительных союзов (особенно конструкций вида ""да ..., но ...""), не бояться признать свою неправоту (вместо того, чтобы отнекиваться и оправдывать себя), строить предложения так, чтобы собеседник как можно чаще был вынужден отвечать Вам ""да"", ...)Как оказывать влияние на людей (как можно чаще поощряйте и хвалите человека за любой успех (особенно, если хотите указать ему на его ошибки), избегайте прямой критики, задавайте вопросы, а не давайте приказы (чтобы человек думал, что идея исходила от него самого), ...)Бонус: Как сделать Вашу семейную жизнь лучше и счастливее (не критикуйте и не придирайтесь, будьте искренне, признательны и внимательны к партнеру/супругу, прочитайте хорошую книгу о сексуальной стороне брака, …)В общем-то, ни одна из этих идей не претендует на особую гениальность или оригинальность (книга, кстати, была издана почти 80 лет назад). Но тем не менее, все они весьма практичны и могут сослужить добрую службу в нелегком деле завоевания друзей и оказания влияния на окружающих Вас людей.В целом, книга написана немного нудновато, но зато каждый из принципов проиллюстрирован набором неплохих примеров и сценариев. Плюс, периодические отсылки на исторические личности позволяют несколько скрасить монотонность изложения. Если Вы решили ""подкачать"" Ваш эмоциональный интеллект или Вам просто захотелось почитать что-нибудь из популярной психологии, то книга Дейла Карнеги ""Как завоёвывать друзей и оказывать влияние на людей"" будет отличным выбором.Не мега-шедевр, но стоящая книга. Оценка: 4+ балла."
"1849",1848,"Chris Wiegman","Contains tons stuff I knew but never think about. I didn't believe it at first but because some concepts do build on each-other later on the suggestion to read each chapter twice before going to the next really REALLY helps. (I mark in my book good points).I will say A) it's a little older of a book but still holds true even today and B) some stuff for me I struggle breaking old habits even though I should be doing' exactly the opposite LOL. VERY USEFUL There are some 'use it today' info in here too like why some people love babies and can have a great friendships with their dogs in such a short time (babies genuinely smile back at people and dogs are truly interested in their owners. On the flip side is also true; being fake with people makes things worse).Another favorite of mine is how important small talk can be. Seems wasteful but it goes a long way to building trust in communication, when people have common ground, they are used to talking to you, share common interests or past, etc. it helps. Also it's been repeatedly measured in many countries people who play games together trust each other 11x faster than people who only work together. (aka why I need a PS3).This was slow read for me, however highly recommended. "

"1863",1862,"Hollandemily","WELCOME To My Small World of Embroidery:embroidery.blogspot.comI read a few books and articles this year that reference this book, so I thought I'd pull it out again. I first read this book when I was 17 and it really opened my eyes. I remembered that it impacted me and figured the lessons were worth revisiting. While this is mostly true, I'd forgotten, perhaps chose to forget, how dated some of these anecdotes are. Beyond the ""Golly gee! That's swell!"" types of exchanges, you can't overlook that it was written at a time before global corporations and billion-dollar mergers. And let's face it, our attention spans are at an all-time low and our needs for instant gratification are at an all-time high. People deal with each other differently now. In some ways, we communicate more efficiently, but in my opinion, we also tend to hear more of what we want to hear, so being CLEAR is more important than being KIND. [image error]The overall principals of treating people the way you'd like to be treated remain the best course of action. The author tends to go a little overboard with repeating some of his points, but maybe some people need to be beaten over the head to understand the kind of impact their words and behavior have on their peers and loved ones. However, I'm concerned that following the directions set forth by this antiquated literature to the letter could lead to some serious crushing of careers, happiness, and well-being. Maybe I'm becoming meaner or more jaded or both, but if you're one of the handful of people who hasn't read this yet, read it with a grain of salt... or read a book on negotiation, which is probably what you're really looking for anyway."

"1872",1871,"Vanga Srikanth","Dale Breckenridge Carnegie's How to Win Friends & Influence People Book Review by Vanga SrikanthAbout the AuthorDale Carnegie (1888-1955) described himself as a ""simple country boy"" from Missouri but was also a pioneer of the self-improvement genre. Since the 1936 publication of his first book, How to Win Friends and Influence People, he has touched millions of readers and his classic works continue to impact lives to this day. Book Review by Vanga SrikanthThis book mainly offers examples of a practical form of diplomacy. Don't criticize people directly so as to shame them; always articulate your sincere compliments when appropriate; make an effort to remember and use a person's name, etc. There's some good advice here on finessing your speech to get your honest point across without causing anyone to begrudge you for it, and some ways to train yourself not to take people for granted.However, this book was written a long time ago, for people with average or better communications skills. If you're shy and introverted, or have autism or Asperger's, this is not the book to coax you out of yourself. This isn't to say it's of no use to an introverted person, but using the techniques advocated will be more of a challenge. His advice is so obvious and so easy, so how come it's so difficult to do yourself and so rarely found in others? Is it cynicism or manipulation? No, it's human nature: Do Unto Others.THE FUNDAMENTALS""Speak ill of no man and speak all the good you know of everyone.""People react very badly to criticism; don't do it, not to their face nor behind their back ... especially not behind their back. Say ""Thank You"".Express appreciation. People yearn, yearn to be appreciated. Talk about what people want and help them get it.""Arouse in others an eager want.""Corollary: let others take credit for your ideas; they'll like your ideas a lot more if they believe them to be their own. WAYS TO MAKE PEOPLE LIKE YOU:Be happy to see people.Greet everyone you meet and show an interest in them. Remember the things that are important to them. Smile! Remembers peoples' names!!Remember it, use it when talking to them. A person's name sounds beautiful to them. Draw people out.Encourage them to talk about themselves and their interests. ? Actively research the other person's interests.Every person you meet feels themselves superior to you in some way.Strain to find out what that is and recognize their importance. Talk to people about themselves and they will listen to you for hours.WIN PEOPLE TO YOUR WAY OF THINKING.Don't argue!Give in! Agree that the other person is right; often they are and if they aren't, you'll never convince them of it by arguingDon't ever tell a person they're wrong.They may be but telling them so is always counterproductive. It is difficult for a person to admit to themselves that they are wrong; harder still to admit it to others.Friendliness begets friendliness.Always begin that way. Don't accuse.Never neglect a kindness.Look for ways to do or say something nice.Start out by emphasizing areas of agreement.When a person has said ""no"" it's hard to get them to change even if they know they're wrong.Let the other person do most of the talking.Listen patiently and don't interrupt. Let your friends be better than you.Let people come to your conclusions.First, tell me what you expect of me; then tell me what I can expect of you. People will generally live up to the commitments they make to you as long as they came up with them on their own. Think always in terms of the other person's point of view.Where they stand depends on where they sit; figure out where they're sitting.of the people you will ever meet are dying for sympathy.Give it to them and they will love you. A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger. Dramatize your ideas.""Don't use logic; tell stories."" Make your ideas visible, concrete. Bear in mind that people don't know until you show them what you mean.Stimulate in others their innate desire to excel (perhaps through a friendly challenge or through competition).BE A LEADER:Don't go sailing into difficult interpersonal situations with guns blazing. You'll always get a negative reaction.Change ""but"" into ""and"".Be indirect in your criticism. Praise before you condemn.Ask questions rather than giving orders.Be very careful to help others preserve their dignity.People crave recognition: praise the smallest improvement and praise every improvement.Treat people as though they had the virtues you wished they possessed.Give them a reputation to live up to and they will work like crazy to live up to it.Praise the good; minimize the bad: encourage.Make achievement seem possible. Take and encourage little baby steps. Seek out even the most insignificant of successes.Napoleon: I could conquer the world if only I had enough ribbon.RegardsVanga Srikanth"

"1875",1874,"Masih","I know I am not good at expressing myself peacefully so, I picked this book to see if there is something I am doing wrong. Yes, there are so many subtle but very important things that, according to this book, I can and should do in my everyday verbal interactions. I've always tried to be as direct and frank as possible and never taken into account the emotional reactions to my opinions since I had just assumed that they should have been mature enough to accept my opposing views without feeling hostility toward me. I am sure this has never been the case and I may have offended many of them, unintentionally. The recipe is simple. I have to consider in my conversations the fact that I am going to talk with an egotist, sensitive and careless person just like myself! I have to smile, consider the benefits of other persons, not to engage in arguments and not to criticize them directly or else I have to face ill-intention and defensive attitude. I am not sure that reading a book does make me better at communication but the least I have got from reading this book is knowing that there are principles which can be followed in order to gain more from interpersonal communications. I hope I can use them from now on. "

Además, siendo este libro el abuelo de los libros de autoayuda, su lenguaje hoy suena complaciente y barato. Pero eso solo es el prejuicio que uno lleva antes de leer.El contenido es excelente. Una vez que lo lees con honestidad y mente abierta, descubres excelentes consejos para aplicar en tu vida. La propia introducción muestra que los concejos no son fruto de la filosofía personal del autor, sino de su estudio de decenas de biografías y relatos de personas prominentes. Ese es, para mi, el gran valor del libro.Mi consejo personal: Para aplicar estos consejos, es importante recordar la honestidad y la fuerza interior. Si una persona quiere ser falsa o hipócrita, o necesita constante validación de otros; estos concejos no le servirán. Cultívate primero a ti mismo, antes de salir a influenciar a los demás."

With that said some suggestions seem rather patronizing, especially those pertaining to leadserhip.However, this book is still chock full of good advice.

I enjoyed the old-timey feel, but actually think I'd have preferred the original version, because it was weird having an example from the seventies tossed in when the bulk of the text is clearly decades older. On that note, like most self-help books I find that the work is padded with too many examples. It might be just as worthwhile to study the bullet list of techniques and apply them without going through the entire book. "
"1926",1925,"Alexander Charchar","Self-help books can be dicey.Many of them seem to riff on the same ideas (or at least this is the impression most Amazon summaries/reviews give), and the few I've flicked through in libraries and bookstores seem to lean more towards the ""You can do it! Think positive and it'll happen! Hazzaaa!"" side. They're painful and often give the vibe that they are written by people who aren't sure of any of the things they're writing about, but have read enough self-help books that they feel they have been helped. I always wonder how many people are just hiding their own issues by being distracted through pretending to know what they're talking about.Practicality is often missing, plausible examples slim. This is where Carnegie's little classic goes in a different direction.I was surprised by how enjoyable the book was, and although the format started to feel a little tired towards the end, I still raced through to the very last page. The advice is incredibly hands-on and offered up by students experiences, and I found myself starting to apply what I was reading within a few days and noticed some improvements in how I felt around people and how people seemed to feel around me.The shortest possible way of putting all the advice is: Be nice. ""Be nice"" is a deceptive little phrase that has many shades. There are many different ways to be nice, but most of us seem to go for the default of just asking ""how's it going?"" while passing a coworker in the hallway and think our selves so brilliant for being so nice. All this in spite of the fact that we are normally hoping we don't get anything more than a ""Great!"" in response. Please, nothing real.I found in How To Win Friends and Influence People some interesting ways to hold court with those you interact with, be they friends, strangers or coworkers, in a way that was relaxed and enjoyable. Awkward silences seemed to have disappeared, in their place are happy little conversations.I've read some people suggest the ""How to win friends"" element of the title is a little misconstrued as most of what is found in the book wouldn't allow for much more than a superficial relationship without much bonding. After reading the book and thinking it worth my time, I still find myself agreeing with this. This won't win you lifelong friends, at least not directly. Much of what is covered by Carnegie involves subtly shifting conversation so it is more pleasant for all parties, but in a way that suggests business friendships will be built, not real ones. However I must add one caveat – while the techniques here may not grant one real, bonding friendships, I can see how the techniques allow the foundation for one to be laid down. It leaves opportunity for exciting conversation to spring forth when nothing but formal, robotic discussions might have previously been the norm.But for it to be of any value, one must take what is written as small lessons and be conscious in their daily application. It's a book that would probably improve as one refers back to it weekly, rereading the highlighted passages they found interesting and going over the summaries at the end of each chapter. This isn't a magical set-and-forget type selfhelp book, it does require work, but is work worth doing.An interesting realisation is that Carnegie was using many of the techniques he wrote about in the book on the reader. Every now and then you would catch a phrase or use of language that was written about earlier, but in a way to help you agree with what was being said. Sly, for sure, but it at least shows the man lived what he preached."
"1928",1927,"Audri","Reading this book has made me realize that you can't force someone to believe you and your train of thought. You also can't tell someone to do something without praising what the other person does first, otherwise they will resent you for it. Praising is always better than criticizing. Think thoroughly well before you act. "

"1937",1936,"Olivia Lewis","This was a good book, but I do believe it has a major flaw.This advice is most effective for men, and probably would be ineffective for women. Women who listen, who go out of their way to be nice-- smiling, never criticizing, acting appreciative, making the other person feel important (all things Carnegie suggests)-- are generally seen as pushovers and are subsequently walked over-- by their employees, by their employers, and by their coworkers. By contrast, when men do the things Dale Carnegie describes, especially when that man is your employer, he is soon as a fair and upright man who is doing you a special favor in listening/respecting you/etc."
"1938",1937,"Tecni","La comunicación con humanos: la última frontera. Estas son las lecturas de Ferio en una misión que durará toda la eternidad, dedicada a camuflarse entre la gente ""normal"", al descubrimiento de vida inteligente (if any), hasta alcanzar las habilidades necesarias para subyugar al resto de la población con una sonrisa. Forzada, pero sonrisa: Dientes, dientes, que eso es lo que les jode.Este manual de comunicación formaba parte de una colección que estaba en el piso en el que vivo, pero se lo regalé a alguien empeñado en dominar el mundo; hace poco me acordé de él y terminé comprándoselo a la empresa para la que trabaja: ha ganado doblemente. Aparte de esta interesante anécdota, ahora debería criticar sesudamente el libro, pero estoy en el trabajo con fiebre y no voy a dar mucho de sí.Siendo el libro típico en estas lides, el que todos los programas perilleros de radio mencionan siempre, el que los nazis nunca usaron y así les fue, opino que da consejos muy útiles basados en el sentido común y el Contrato Social, pero que resultan ingenuos e incluso inefectivos en un tiempo en el que estamos de vuelta de todo y las ciencias sociales han medido ya todo al dedillo. También es un libro netamente protestante/maniqueo: las cosas se pueden hacer bien o mal, no hay grises en su mundo de color.Aún así, dice cosas muy valiosas, de esas que no cobran sentido en tu mente hasta que alguien las escribe y tú las lees a pesar de que nos han sido enseñadas ya antes. En este sentido de hacer evidentes las cosas que se nos enseñaron formalmente y olvidamos socialmente es valioso, aunque mucho habrá que entrenarlas para que se conviertan en automatismos y, en los tiempos del divagar mental de las redes sociales, me veo poco capaz de concentrarme en sonreír o empatizar. Bueno, empatizar no lo he hecho nunca, no va a venir este libro a enderezarme ahora...Otra cosa que me ha gustado es que es muy ligero porque, más allá de la escasa teoría que desarrolla poco, cuenta un montón de chismorreos de gente que ha pervivido mejor o peor en la Historia y, a través de esos ejemplos, ves cómo sus enseñanzas se cumplen. Esto tiene otra cara opuesta, claro: en ningún caso pone ejemplos que no vengan como anillo al dedo para lo que quiere decir, y deduzco que habrá nueve situaciones desagradables por cada una en la que se cumpla la profecía, pero esto no es malo necesariamente, solo señal de que el autor conoció a un montón de gente maja en su vida.Es un libro muy útil para convertirte en el maridito ideal que llega a su casa de dos plantas de los suburbs a las 6 PM y tu mujercita te trae las pantuflas y tienes sexo con el perro antes de la cena (y los domingos cortas el coche y limpias el césped). Seguir a rajatabla todos sus consejos te convierte en una persona agradable que probablemente no tenga mucha cabida en el mundo actual; aún así, no está de más conocerlos por si algún día diéramos con una persona educada que no esté nunca a la defensiva. Como decía antes: la última frontera."
"1939",1938,"Grady","This book was good I respect the wisdom that Dale Carnegie provides and some principles. I like he states that is not good to criticize that people usually don't work best under criticism . however , in order to influence people make them believe that they perfect whatever one may be struggling don't just critique him because honestly people just don't respond well under criticism. That one thing I really took out from reading this and I really applying it to the old & new people I encounter everyday. Another wisdom he gives through this book that's really stood out is that everyone influence, in what position or status that you are in. Every single idnvidual has influence on someone and carry some type of influence. The only problem I had with this book is that I don't like the title. Is good to want to influence people however to win friends is a problem. The reality of life is that no everyone is going to agree with every thing you agree and decide to follow you. Its important that you let those things happen naturally and you strive whatever goals you want to strive for. Trust me people will follow. "

"1943",1942,"Divine","Look at the heart. What's your purpose?This book offers some helpful guidelines for someone like me who sucks at dealing with people. But we must remember that it *is* a ""means to an end"".Why do you want to win friends and influence people in the first place?"

"1949",1948,"Renée","It seems like a sound process, plenty of convincing anecdotes, evidence from leading historical figures to janitorial staff (and the odd clerk who became president); wouldn't mind some more supporting information from peer-reviewed psych/behavioral studies. Potentially excellent for improving business or political acumen, not sure how relevant it is to enriching one's personal life beyond the superficial/friend - or follower - count. Adopting a sympathetic attitude to our neighbors and the rest of the world is certainly something many westerners should try out.  I think it's worth pointing out that this book was purported to have been published before the final chapter was written - a chapter on ditching people who, despite your best efforts, continually interfere and hamper your progress and happiness in life... Clearly it wouldn't fit easily with the positive vibe that permeates the rest of the book, but it's another small something worth keeping in mind in light of the larger picture presented in the overall thesis. Do your best, but know that there are some exceptions to every rule.  Note some of the anecdotes/case studies presented in the book are antiquated in a post-information age: automation means there is less room for flexibility in some business - occasionally even personal - transactions, no matter how personable you might be. There can be significantly more barriers to cross when dealing with modern mega-corps before your message will be heard. A winning attitude and smile has to be accompanied by a great deal more persistence and wit. If automation or some other system is in place to prevent flexible procedure, requests may go on unheard almost indefinitely. Choose your battles. Or look for alternative roads outside of the big mess of modern litigious corporate nonsense."

Iš pokalbių išaiškėjo, kad knyga nepatiko tiems, kurie tikėjosi, kad knyga padės susirasti draugų, su kuriais galėtų eiti į koncertus, alaus ir išsilieti visas nuoskaudas. Deja. Ši knyga apie kitokius ""draugus"", apie ""draugus"" iš kurių norime ar tai verslo, karjeros o gal ir kitokios naudos.. Apie kiek vėdmainišką draugystę, paremta gryniausiu egoizmu. Bet nepaisant to, knyga puikiai parašyta, daug pasakojimų iš istorijos, pavyzdžių iš realių situacijų. Nors knyga ir sena, o kai kurie žmonių bendravimo įpročiai ir pakito, bet naudingos ir aktualios informacijos čia užtenka. Svarbu tik suprasti, apie kokius ""draugus"" čia kalbama ir neliksi nusivylęs. "

I found the first part of the book very helpful. It gets somewhat repetitive and he's mainly hammering home the same ideas in various contexts. This is surely geared toward businessmen aiming to ""succeed"" but the principles can be applied to family life, church, or whatever. I got the impression that Carnegie really cared about people and wanted to help them lead better lives. Helpful and recommended. "

If you can't take the Dale Carnegie training, then at least read the book! It's wonderful!"
"1988",1987,"Lance","When I started this book I was very apprehensive. I detested the title, but my plant manager required me to read it. Once I started into it, I was pleasantly surprised. Done with honesty the techniques are very good. My only problem with the book was the last few chapters on flashy salesmanship."
"1990",1989,"عمار لقيس","Some really good tactics for getting people following your orders and work your will.I believe that some aspects of this book can be implied by others and may sound repeated, but in general the author clarifies them for each situation individually with the proper examples."

"2048",2047,"Maura","I recently came across a quote by Dale Carnegie in some literature from my graduate studies and decided to look him up. This book was one of the first things to surface in connection with his name, along with the year of his birth: 1888. The year caught my eye because it just so happens that some of my most favorite paintings by Vincent Van Gogh were created that year. I have two of them hanging in my kitchen, as a matter of fact: 'Fishing Boats on the Beach' and 'A Sidewalk Cafe at Night.' The year alone didn't prompt me to read Carnegie's book, however. I also happen to be taking on some leadership roles at work this year, and I liked the word ""influence"" in Carnegie's title. Many of the principles within the book are basic enough and kind of common sense, really; I have already developed many of the skills which Carnegie points out in the workplace over time. But I especially found value in Part 4, 'Be a Leader: How to Change People without Giving Offense or Arousing Resentment.' The absolute BEST part of this book, though? The fact that it's over 75 years old. And I devoured it in one sitting. "
"2049",2048,"Jamis Johnson","Legitimate - But if you ask Machiavelli or Steve Jobs you may get a different perspective :) Highly recommend this book to anyone looking to advance their social skills and personal influence."

"2052",2051,"Bill Wad","I read this as a teen and still remember its lessons"
"2053",2052,"Ruben","It's tempting to read this book mainly as a historical document, especially given the old-timey, corny, and transparently manipulative anecdotes that fill the book. And a measure of detached awareness like that is appropriate for a book so hell bent on persuading. Still, Carnegie's message holds up well; some of the really good social psych work lately gives good grounding for some of Carnegie's big themes. His greatest insights, I think, are based on how unhelpful it is to treat people as coolly rational. Better, then, to exercise restraint and nurture a measure of skepticism toward hasty judgments about what is likely to win people over. These may not be breakthrough findings, but perhaps David Brent was right when he observed, ""A good idea is a good idea forever."""
"2055",2054,"Paulo","Dale Carnegie wrote this bible on human relations back in the 30s and almost 90 years later it's as relevant as ever. That it contains basically no anachronisms is testament to both its enduring quality and, frankly, to how these issues are timeless and pervasive of every civilisation. I would go so far as argue that our times are possibly the most critical for such a book, if we consider how cold and disconnected we've become.The only downside for me is that although this is not a long book, it contains so many small examples to back each principle (which in turn revolve around one big unifying concept) that at some point it can become a little boring. Other than that, it's essential reading and, in your own interest, you'll be a better human being for it."
"2057",2056,"Marc Udoff","A timeless classic on a topic that basically the social psychology of what the title says. A little slow at times with redundant stories, but worth the read."

"2060",2059,"Melanie Forbush","This book was so good to read! So pertinent to my life at this stage. I am trying to graduate college and find a ""big girl job"" as my husband puts it. This book taught me not only how to cultivate relationships between co workers but also my personal relationships with family and friends. It provides me with specific examples which brought the principle in a whole new light. I would recommend this for all people looking to improve their relationships in life. great book!!"
"2061",2060,"Daniel Kessler","There are a lot of important lessons here that should be learned by everyone. Unfortunately, the book is sometimes repetitive and sometimes gives advice that you shouldn't use with people that you either have or want to develop long-term relationships with (the book is mainly targetted towards people who want to become better salesmen). Still, the book has tremendous value to anyone and should be read by anyone who wants to become a better communicator (which is everyone)."

"2071",2070,"Marc Walls","Rarely would I think that literature of this variety would hold up from a 1936 release but in the case of Carnegie's book, it definitely has. I can't give it the full five stars for one reason. Mainly, and essentially, these are people skills but you are ""working the crowd"". While they make work and many are effective and good practices in conversation, without any degree of sincerity you will always be exposed for your intentions.Taken for what it is, the book is a fun, entertaining read that definitely features some ideas to improve socially. I explored the book to look for ways to break through my reserved, shy side as I looked build relationships and grow my network. I have found that it has helped and I am constantly thinking back to something I came across when I use it in conversation."
"2072",2071,"Mandellagreen Green","Hard to beat as far as simple things we can do to improve our social interactions."
"2075",2074,"Michael Thompson","Great book full of timeless advice. As this was written over 70 years ago, you have probably heard most of the suggestions through some other source by now, but reading them again all together and with real-world applications makes the book still worth it. It can get a bit dull in the middle with example after example of how to use the advice."
"2079",2078,"Jose Alguacil","A basic to read book. Old, yes. Old fashioned examples, yes. Old writing, yes. But behind of this there a great powerful tool to life and business.Very recommended "
"2081",2080,"Zak J","I found myself bookmarking a lot of pages. I'm a person that's not naturally talented at considering the impact of my communication and this book offers a lot of simple and logical reminders. It would be best used if referred to frequently, perhaps before going to work, with the goal of using the technique throughout the day. I unfortunately haven't made it this far. Several things also annoyed me about the book. It's easy to see how Mr. Carnegie would make a great salesmen but a poor scientist. His language is not precise (using sweeping claims like ""everyone likes..."") and the ""evidence"" is almost exclusively anecdotal. However, this book doesn't claim to be a scientific study and it achieves its purpose of being a straight-forward and practical guide to working on bettering your communication with people. "

"2151",2150,"Brigid","I have a love hate relationship with Dale Carnegie; this book is no different. What he says has some quality to it and is timeless: be kind, sincere and think of other people's feelings. But I think he romanticizes what it takes to ""pull yourself up from your bootstraps"" (a phrase I loathe after majoring in American Studies). I bet, Dale, that you, too, stepped on people and put your needs ahead of theirs in your climb to success. It was not all charm. You were also ruthless. How can you not be? Also, I don't think this book reads the same for women, even with the progress of gender equality. Here is some of the advice I was given when applying to the corporate world: ""don't smile,"" ""don't clean,"" ""don't bake,"" ""don't be too polite"" or you will be disregarded as competition and will quickly be seen as a secretary not an equal. We have made progress, but the gender inequality is still a large problem (need i mention salaries?)."
"2153",2152,"Arren Q","Listened to the audio, actually. "
"2154",2153,"Bo","I can see why this is such a highly recommended book. Even though it was first written in the 30s, it's still got valid advice for getting along with people and being a positive influence. "
"2155",2154,"Dirk Lapere","Still good after all those years"
"2156",2155,"Ghaze","After I Read and practice from this book, I can make a friends quickly and easily and increase my popularity."
"2158",2157,"Mpr","So this is a really excellent book. Even though it boils down to a couple of fairly simple tips, it's thorough in impressing the exact mechanics of these, and they're all very effectual. Written in a very readable manner."
"2159",2158,"Mohammed Jbl","i learned a lot from this book. this is a book everybody should read to learn how to deal with people and make them do what you want while they are happily doing it. a little boring but very very useful and i'm glad that i have read it.RECOMMENDED"
"2160",2159,"Sheep","It's a classic! (First published in 1937.)"
"2161",2160,"Ignas","Really good book. I found it very useful and I'm sure that I will return to it to refresh what I've read. Most of the principles are acceptable and easy to use for me, but I Know that some people dropped this book just because they found those principles are not the way they can interact with the people. Also what I found interesting that all examples are from old times (well the book is old too), so you can also learn something new about interesting persons from the past."
"2162",2161,"Bernie May","An oldie but a good, with concrete examples and strategies on how to influence people. Get what you want by giving people what they want. More effective that using your positional authority to make people jump through hoops. "
"2163",2162,"Brian Jo","A simple guide, with simple ideas. Some may even argue that the points that the author presents are beyond obvious. However, applying them to your everyday life is a challenge. Set all doubts aside, and actually practice what Dale suggests. It serves to remove all selfish temptations and motives, and encourages you to be humble. Not entirely convinced? No worries, the author provides many examples to prove his arguments. "
"2167",2166,"Syed","Very good read and useful tips. Got to read it again because i have forgotten most of the things. However one point, being sincere in all you do, is not forgotten!"
"2168",2167,"Nelson","A well written book. Enjoyed reading it..."
"2172",2171,"Jeniann","Many great insights on dealing with people; if I really did everything in this book I would be a better person"
"2173",2172,"James Phillips","While some of the anecdotes are laughably outdated and the situations contrived, I can see why this book continues to live on as one of the great books on leadership."
"2175",2174,"Allison Boerum","Great for personal and professional development"
"2177",2176,"Matt Bibby","I was definitely more interested than I thought I would with this book. It had been on and off my to read list since I was 13. Now that I read it, I regret waiting. Although this book was originally published in the 1930s, it's content hardly leaves that impression. I found my self several times wondering why the author has not mentioned certain events, only to remember that they have yet to happen. Was a tad repetitive, but I did learn a thing or two which was more than what I expected."
"2178",2177,"Christian Ensign","Poorly titled in my opinion...this book really helped me understand the context of the human mind and how to reach that through a multitude of various events - business, sales, friendship, marriage, and parenting. A must read classic for all."
"2179",2178,"Syafiqa","I was initially very skeptical about self-help books, but I'm glad my husband convinced me to read this. Very interesting. The advice given seems like simple common sense, but these days it seems rarely practised. Good points from the book: always make effort to remember people names, be generous in giving praises and showing appreciation, try to think from others perspective, do not put people in bad spot. I'm sure Rasulullah practised all this, I want to try to find a similar book from that point of view. Any recommendation?"
"2180",2179,"Marek Herman","A few good ideas, I believe it's still useful even after the years."
"2184",2183,"Fortu","While in the self-help topic and with a little outdate style, it makes you think about how you face dealing with people´s desires and needs. Surprisingly valid and ""modern""; Dale Carnegie puts the self-image of each person as the most important thing to preserve and the use of possitive thinking as the main tool to reach win-win situations. Definitely still valid and deserves a reading to not forget the ""basics"" of human relationships."
"2186",2185,"Victor Davis","It's been a very long time since I've read this book. I didn't realize how deeply it affected me until reading it a second time and thinking, ""Wow, I'm really living all this."" In hindsight, I'm glad I read it at an impressionable young age. There is a certain expectation in young males to value things like competitiveness, aloofness, precision.  Dale Carnegie slashes through such ideas with a philosophy bent on sympathy, courtesy, and compromise. He is quite sexist, but considering the time period, I won't judge the message by the messenger. The meat of his message seems to be ""if you are a selfish person, try selflessness as a tool to get what you want."" He does stress the necessity of being genuine, which tempers the ""go get 'em"" attitude. Regardless of its flaws, it is an important work for anyone looking to shore up their interpersonal communication skills."
"2187",2186,"Jim Wilbourne","This isn't a book I would normally pick up, but I read it because a job I applied for was looking for people who had read this book and understood its concepts.While I feel like it didn't completely change my world (there were no real ""aha!"" moments for me), it was nice to read concepts that you should have learned at a very young age re-presented for an adult. For that reason alone, I believe it is a book that shouldn't be exclusively read by sociopaths. While that doesn't sound like a good review, I actually do think this book holds value.If you you work in customer service, work in a field where you need to interact with strangers, or you're having a hard time getting along with someone you know, it may be worth picking this up and seeing if it has something to offer you."
"2189",2188,"Talal","Great book. Probably worth reading more than once throughout your lifetime. Incredibly focused on empathy, understanding, making the people in front of you feel valued and heard. #What drops it a star is that it's sometimes quite patronizingly simple in ways, as it is talking about things we all know, or ought to know. But really the 4 star rating is due to the self-help mechanisms it utilizes to get people to buy in. To get people to think that these principles are magical and will change your life unrecognizably. The are valuable tools, no doubt, but they will not alone change your life, and Carnegie intimates that people who are billionaires and visionaries got that way using these as their primary routes to success. I understand that they are useful to help readers' confidence to execute these teachings, and in that way I believe that the book is quite dated. As we have moved forward in society, our standards for satisfaction to believe things has gone up, and as such, the mechanisms that help people 'buy in' to concepts will need to be more complicated.In that way, maybe in it's day, I would have given it 5 stars. Definitely a recommended book :)"
"2192",2191,"Kyle Gannon","Great book in the importance of relationships. I would recommend this to anyone in college or just beginning their career. "
"2194",2193,"Julie.dizzy","Just a simple book to reveal the critical errors people keep making in everyday communication. Despite the very inviting title, this book should not be perceived as a must-have guide to manipulating people since it is clearly not that. Generally speaking, the book is about small tips that we usually forget. It is definitely worth reading. "
"2195",2194,"Kayla","This book had wonderful advice and great modern examples of influence. The only problem is I'm not in a leadership role so this is nothing I can practice. All of the directors at my job should read this book, especially my boss."
"2199",2198,"Lance Contrucci","Very enjoyable visit to yesteryear, when people were decent."
"2201",2200,"Ketti","This was a re-read for me, lots of good things to be reminded of.It was great again, and I enjoyed it as an audio-read."
"2202",2201,"Patrick Gendron","I had heard of this book numerous times since I have started my professional career. I was always weary of it due to its title, made me feel like it was a book about how to manipulate people. However, many of the ideas and actions that Carnegie puts forward in this book are just common sense if you want to have flexible, positive relationships with other people. Hints for interpersonal relations in that book that I have long known to bring others joy, such as using their name, or giving a sincere complement are easy to start implementing in your life. Some of the others that Dale puts forward are a little harder. This is a read that everyone should experience, and try some of the things suggested. If anything, its a fun social experiment and neat to see how your relationships effect your own life. "
"2204",2203,"Willem","Lot's of things everyone should already know. In general be patient and listen more than talk."
"2206",2205,"Manju","A well written book. Enjoyed reading it..."

"2212",2211,"Lucas Mota","Muito interessante. as vezes um pouco exagerado em algumas ideias mas tem um valor incrível de pesquisa."
"2213",2212,"Hakan Jackson","A good book for its time. A little too ""Peace love and happiness"" for me to give it a 5 star. The ""positive"" emotions are well and good, but there is a reason we have ""negative"" emotions. Though, Dale Carnegie can be forgiven, being that the concept of emotional intelligence had not been developed yet. I do enjoy the fact that he clams to have gathered all the science of the time in aid for his book. It's like a snapshot of psychology in the 30's, to give you a feel for that the biggest psychologist of the time was B. F. Skinner. All in all it was a better book of history than a book for winning friends and influencing people. Though, if the latter is your objective then this book wouldn't hurt."

"2219",2218,"Bertrand","Voilà un best-seller du management qui est en fait un manuel de communication pragmatique aux visées très générales, sans doute un des pionniers du développement personnel. La durée de vie des ouvrages de management est relativement courte, du fait des transformations des entreprises et de leur adaptation à un univers macro-économique et sociétal changeant. Aussi, la longévité exceptionnelle de celui-ci (soixante-dix ans déjà) peut apparaître comme une gageure de qualité, du moins l’éditeur avance cet argument de vente.L’objectif affiché est d’aider le lecteur à travailler sur sa relation aux autres et à désamorcer les conflits de la vie quotidienne. L’auteur croît en la motivation par le partage, l’altruisme et la confiance, il bannit les ordres brutaux, les sanctions aveugles, la menace, le management par la peur. Le livre se structure en une trentaine de leçons très pragmatiques, abondamment illustrées d’exemples tirés de l’Histoire ou des expériences de Dale Carnegie et de ses élèves. Carnegie a étudié et expérimenté la psychologie et le comportement humain pendant des années afin de découvrir les facteurs permettant à certains leaders exceptionnels de tirer ceux qui les entourent vers le haut. Après avoir enseigné pendant des années et à des centaines d’étudiants les conclusions de ses recherches, il écrit le présent ouvrage, synthèse de son travail.Le livre est très accessible, applicable à toutes les situations sociales (professionnelle, familiale, etc.), et orienté vers une utilisation pratique immédiate. Il est cependant assez bien argumenté et souvent divertissant. Même si l’auteur s’en défend, on ne peut s’empêcher d’être gêné par une approche « truc et astuces », qui s’attache à inculquer des comportements efficaces envers l’autre, plutôt que le changement d’attitude profond pour lequel plaide pourtant Carnegie explicitement. L’auteur souhaite en effet livrer des techniques clef en main, et on ne peut s’empêcher de penser qu’un travail approfondi sur soi et sa relation aux autres serait un complément intéressant, sinon indispensable, à la lecture et l’application de l’ouvrage. Pourtant, la lecture de « How to win friends and influence people » ouvre bien des portes à celui qui a la volonté de creuser ces 250 pages."

"2223",2222,"Amr","Fascinating book ,I learned more than I expected from this book however from my opinion the concepts in this book can be also used to be manipulative and dissipative towards others so when you read this book you should read it with the intention of becoming a better communicator and not to use these concepts to manipulate other people unethically "

"2226",2225,"Roope Keto","I try to summarize this shortly:The main principle (at least I think) was that try to think from other person's perspective. Everything else pretty much follows."
"2227",2226,"David Robinson","Excellent. Interesting to explain and use examples of things we do (or do not do) naturally.

"2228",2227,"Priya Sharma","I came across this book while reading an article online. And then found it in the library. Though, I must admit the title sounds a bit manipulating.

"2234",2233,"Jenny","Such a great book on human relations. This is definitely one to revisit often."
"2241",2240,"Kristina","This book gives great advice for interacting with others and clearly communicating in an effective manner. I have learned a lot from reading this. Unfortunately, without practice and reminders, a lot of it is forgotten, but this would be a great book to own to be able to refer back to (as the author even suggests to do). There are certainly some good insights and ideas that make a lot of sense. I enjoyed the near constant examples and mini success stories."
"2243",2242,"Jessa","An interesting, if dated, look into good social skills. Fun to read, if only because you know you're reading a book that so many people have reached for in the past several decades. Thoroughly American in its outlook, too; kind of fun to read through the lens of ""What would a citizen of a different country have to say about this book??"""
"2246",2245,"Ryo","Easier said than done Dale! I do like this book because it's a reminder to be humble, to listen to others, and treat them with respect."

"2250",2249,"Aryeli","No es mi tipo de lectura, sin embargo, es de esos libros que uno sabe que necesita leer y a pesar de haber pensado que no me gustaría, sí lo hizo. Ahora sólo debo releerlo unas 5 veces más para recordar y aplicar las cosas que que aprendí con el libro xD"
"2252",2251,"Ally","interesting insight into the human mind. I'll definitely try to implement some of the ideas...especially those related to conversation making. As an introvert, I'm sure these tips will make a difference. After all, he seems to be emphasizing on listening and asking questions more, which seems pretty doable."
"2253",2252,"Madelyn","I'm sure that everyone could take a lession or two from this book. I've taken a new one everytime I've read it. If your having social trouble, problems at work, even talking to your kids, this book will help."
"2256",2255,"Kryzia","As part of my list of books I should read as an aspiring PR professional, this book offers great insight into principles and ideas that we may already be aware of, but do not fully practice. I appreciate the real-life applications and examples of each principle, further coaxing me to see that not only is it ideal, but it is practical. Nothing is too-far-fetched that it seems impossible to apply. Every idea mentioned in the book can be applicable not only to the professional aspect of our lives, but also the social and the personal.The title of the book may discourage some from reading it, because who really wants to admit that they are friendless and need the help of a book? But reading this book is not admitting that you are socially awkward and have no friends, reading this book is acknowledging the fact that human relationships are very complex and there are a few things we need to be reminded of from time to time. A lot of the principles in this book are things that many of us already practice in some form, it's just a great read for further improvement. It is not about learning how to manipulate situations to your favor, it is about learning what it means to be a genuinely kind person and how it makes business and personal relationships better."

"2264",2263,"Shraddha","As you can tell by the author, this book was written quite some time ago and several references are out-of-date. However, the book is a quick and interesting read. The general attitude and personality of the public has changed a bit since the 1930s and, as a result, not all of Carnegie's lessons are applicable. But, the essence of this book is still good and useful. "
"2266",2265,"Conner Baisley","A fine book, and even though a lot of the ideas in it are things most readers will have realized themselves, Carnegie presents his findings in such a fun and detailed way that it is enjoyable to read even if none of it is new to you.
