0,Susan Becraft,"A delicious psychological thriller!I had considered Gone Girl to be at the pinnacle of my favorite genre - the psychological thriller. The Girl on the Train sits beside Gillian Flynn's page-turner, in my opinion. I foolishly began reading Paula Hawkins' book before going to sleep and could not stop until I reached the last page. As was true with Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train must be read carefully, and the reader must pay close attention to details, including the dates embedded in each chapter.The story is told by three women. Rachel, whose life has pretty much bottomed out, rides a train to London every day to fool her flatmate into thinking she has a job. She entertains herself by looking into houses along the tracks and becomes almost obsessed with a couple she sees daily. In Rachel's mind, they are the golden couple and the object of her envy. She even gives them names.Anna, whose house is close to that of the golden couple, is the wife of Rachel's ex-husband, Tom. They have a young daughter, Evie. The affair, which ended Rachel's marriage, was devastating to her, but the most hurtful thing was Anna's pregnancy. Rachel had desperately wanted a child, but the only round of IVF that she and Tom could afford failed and the marriage with it. Megan, the golden wife, lives with her husband, Scott, in another house along the railroad tracks. Rachel is so enthralled by the couple that she fabricates stories about what she considers to be their perfect life. This all charges when she sees Megan kissing another man from the train window.Rachel's already turbulent life takes another nosedive when Megan goes missing. Determined to help the police find her, Rachel is brought into contact with her detractors, Anna, Tom and Scott. Because of her alcoholism, she is treated as a pariah by them and as an unreliable witness by the police. Even she distrusts her faulty memory.The story has countless twists and turns, which demand the reader's complete attention. The characters are beautifully developed as the complex people they are. Just when I thought I had a handle on them, I discovered a new nugget, which completely changed them. As is true in all well-written books of this genre, no one is what he or she seems on the surface. The writing flows effortlessly, gradually building to a climax.I highly recommend The Girl on the Train to fans of books like Gone Girl. Just don't make my mistake and start reading at 11:00 pm because you will most likely lose a night's sleep!"
1,Jordynn Prado,"True to its reviews, this book reads like Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl (and I think with a hint of All Fall Down by Jennifer Weiner). I was a bit slow to get in this story, but as soon as I did...wow! Hooked for sure, I had to know who dun it. Something that really drew me in was the authors ability to thoroughly manipulate the reader's emotions towards each of the characters at any point in the story. For instance, you feel manage to feel sorry for, disgusted and frustrated by, angry and annoyed with the protagonist, Rachel, and then you FINALLY realize (after a slow build. of course) why she is how she is. Oh boy, and then does that anger transfer or what! Finally, I'm not one for loose ends, so where GG left me frustrated, at least TGOTT gave me some, SOME, closure. "
2,Leah,"Thrilling and suspenseful from the very start; a real page-turner. I was seriously impressed by the author's impeccable management of timing and information, which kept me nervous and hooked right until the end. Great book!"
3,Carrie Waibel,"Fun read for a snowy afternoon. Good for fans of Gone Girl, especially those who found the first portion of Gone Girl kind of boring. All action all the time here!"
4,Joanne D'arcy,"This is the book that everyone is going to be talking about in 2015. It is building up a lot of interest. In my opinion rightly so - this debut book is going to make a long journey all of its own.Rachel gets on the 8.04 train to London, she has been doing it for so long she knows not just which stations it will stop at but all the signals along the way.At one of those signals, she can see into the gardens of some houses. She can see the residents. In fact Rachel has become so interested in one particular couple that she has given them names 'Jason and Jess' and created a whole story for them. Their life looks idyllic and obviously divorced Rachel is missing what she once had.But one day when the train stops at the same signal she sees something that does not fit in with this ideal life of these strangers. Suddenly the story she has created becomes a real nightmare. Rachel then gets involved with the real Jason and Jess, actually called Scott and Megan and it all becomes very close to home. Too close.Can you trust Rachel though? As we learn more about her we see her rely on alcohol. These details are like drip fed to us by the author, is it this why she is divorced? Is it something else? And if she is always recovering from a hangover can we really believe what Rachel says or in fact sees?Whilst we read Rachel's story throughout the book, it is alternated with two other female characters Megan and Anna. Which reality is correct, can we trust any of these characters and are any of their actions justifiable. You go through a number of emotions with these characters as you range from page to page with anger, sympathy and love.As the train continues to stop at that signal, the story keeps going. It has you wanting to know why, it questions what you see, what you hear and most of all what you believe. I liked this about the book, I enjoyed being taken through all the twists and turns and getting back to where I originally was. I am not sure if I guessed the resulting outcome or whether I did not want to acknowledge it and let the book take me on this wonderful journey. It kept the heart beating, the pages turning and reading late into the night. Excellent stuff.""I suppose that everyone does it - looks out at the houses they pass - only we all seem them differently. All saw them differently"".Next time you observe other people's lives remember this book..........."
5,Robert Shone,"Gripping, intense and utterly un-put-downable! "
6,Pam Otterback,5 stars for one wild ride and for being able to keep me guessing until the end.
7,Karen Hoskins,"Very, very suspenseful! Great read!"
8,Annette,"If you require characters that you can love, then The Girl on the Train is not the book for you. The characters are all pretty much despicable. And if you can't handle cheating, then stay away from this one. Other than that, The Girl on the Train is a great read.Rachel is The Girl on the Train. She rides the train to work every day, passing by the house she used to live in with her husband, Tom. He still lives there with his new wife, Anna, who he dumped Rachel for. And they have a new baby. Talk about painful. Rachel deals with this pain by drinking. A lot.Rachel becomes interested in a house just down the road from her old house where another young couple lives. She names them ""Jess and Jason."" And they seem to have the most perfect, loving relationship. ""Jess,"" whose real name is Megan, takes care of Anna's child. Megan does not have the perfect life, as Rachel thinks. Megan has lost the art gallery she used to run and now has nothing to do with her days except mope around.Rachel sees something shocking from the train and after someone disappears, she goes to the police with the information. But she's been drunk so many times, she can't even be sure of what she's telling the police, and they don't believe much of what she says.Hawkins weaves an intricate web around these five people. They become intertwined, unwillingly, in unexpected ways. These characters are awful. The more we learn about them, the more we loath. I get that they are unhappy for different reasons, in different ways. But jees. Do something for yourselves instead of complaining. I think the story takes a while to get going, but when I'm listening I tend to be more patient with a slow-building plot.I did suspect (not right away) who the bad person was (well, they were all bad, but I mean the perpetrator.) That didn't take away from the fascination I felt while watching this all play out. The Girl on the Train has been compared to Gone Girl, and while it did have the contemptible characters, it's a different story.If you are a fan of the twisted who-done-it, (as long as you can handle the characterizations and subject matter) then you should definitely pick up The Girl on the Train. Teens should like this one too."
9,Magdalena Sielska,"Really great book. Fascinating, engrossing and nail biting until the last page! Perfect weekend read although ending felt a little bit flat for me "
10,Yolanda Sfetsos,"I've had my eye on this book for a while, so I put it on hold at the library. Problem was, 60 other people did the same. LOL. But it was eventually my turn to borrow it.As soon as I started reading, I was hooked. I mean, how could I not be? The main narrator--Rachel--is still hung up on the husband who left her two years ago. She's also a hopeless drunk who just couldn't stay on track. Well, except for the train track, because she rode that every single day. Even though she'd lost her job MONTHS AGO.Then we meet Megan. A woman who is so bored with her life that lying and cheating becomes her thing. Not to mention that she has some seriously dark secrets.Oh, but there's more. Enter a woman called Anna, who is now married to Rachel's ex-husband. Actually, she was Tom's mistress for a while before he left Rachel. Anna's now a wife herself, and a mother, but she's more concerned about the picture-perfect family they look like from afar than what's really going on.The night Megan disappears, the lives of these three women intertwine. One was so blind drunk she can't remember what she saw and why she got hurt. The other starts getting paranoid. And of course, one of them is missing.I loved this book! It was deliciously messed up. The characters, the story, the conclusion... hell, even the locations are messed up because of these people. The writing is outstanding. It gripped me from the first word. Even though three women share the narration and all three are several degrees of fucked up, each POV felt/sounded different. The one thing they all share is how self-absorbed and unreliable they all are.This story is what makes me look forward to thrillers! When they're written well, man. This is a great example of a complicated, gripping and super dark story that surfaces from a very simple topic: sociopaths. ;)Great book!"
11,Ulla,"Wonderful, simply wonderful, even fascinating! I had the audio version, and the three narrator ladies were magnificent. And the characters were developed in a way, one had no idea, until the end, whom to like and whom to fear. And Rachel made it! Hope that's not a spoiler!"
12,Leslie Horn,this was a good and fast read
13,Nuno Ferreira,"Tal como diz na contracapa, o livro é de leitura compulsiva. Tudo bem, ele não é muito grande, mas li o livro em quatro dias, sem grande tempo disponível para leituras. Assim como a atriz Reese Whiterspoon, foi um livro que me deixou acordado grande parte da noite. No entanto, talvez por estar habituado a leituras fortes, não achei o livro muito violento, nem perturbador ou arrepiante. Talvez o mais próximo disso que encontrei, tenha sido o terror psicológico do livro. Estamos metidos dentro da mente de uma alcóolica, com os sons típicos da viagem de comboio, perdidos nas memórias difusas, confusos sobre os acontecimentos que precederam e estiveram envoltos num crime, sem saber em quem confiar. A escrita não é nenhuma obra de arte, sem floreados, vai direta à questão, sempre na primeira pessoa, o que confere uma carga mais intimista à leitura. É um livro para as massas. Para a pessoa moderna. Mais, para o público feminino, não só por os pontos de vista serem da perspetiva de mulheres, como ele mostra uma visão pouco masculina. Aqui, as mulheres têm defeitos, mas isso é visto como normal, enquanto os homens à distância parecem perfeitos, e quando se conhecem por perto, são uns filhos da mãe. É uma típica perspetiva de mulher..O que mais me agradou no livro foi a humanidade dos seus personagens, e de longe a que mais me agradou foi Rachel. Criei empatia com o personagem desde o primeiro momento. É uma pessoa que mente com frequência, mas é uma mentira ingénua, uma mentira que revela apenas falta de coragem, a coragem que fugiu com a sua vida perfeita e com o visual bonito que envergava. Ao longo do livro vamos conhecendo mais desta mulher, da sua personalidade labiríntica que se revela ser das mais ingénuas e genuínas do thriller..Também gostei de todo o mistério, da forma como foi contado, das pistas deixadas no decorrer dos acontecimentos. A autora soube fazer muito bem todo o suspense, mas a identidade do “culpado” não foi muito difícil de adivinhar, perto da página 200 já tinha na mente que ia ser a personagem menos provável, e que só podia ser aquela. Não é nenhuma obra-prima do género, mas é hipnotizante, tem personagens riquíssimas e muito atuais.http://noticiasdezallar.wordpress.com"
14,theoDora,"Nem egy szívvidító olvasmány, a bőröd alá mászik, csak falod az oldalakat, hogy egyre több mocskos titkok zúduljon rád. Nagyon erős atmoszférát teremtett az írnő, tetszett a stílusa is és az elbeszélés módja (több nézőpont, reggel és esti 'naplóbejegyzésekre' osztva). Nem gondoltam volna, hogy ennyire megtetszik a köny, de biztos, hogy fogok még olvasni az írőnőtől! :)"
15,Ronald,"Due to this book's presence on various bestseller lists, there is almost a pressure to read it. Do I want to be the only one that cannot discuss this? I wanted to save it until I finished another project, did so, and was rewarded by an excellent book that I read in one sitting. Compelling, complex, and an ending that surprised me.The train is a unifying device to link characters in varying degrees of closeness. Rachel rides the train every day, it sets the parameters of her existence; it is one thing she can count on. There is alcohol, of course, but she cannot count on it; alcohol may be concealing repressed memories or it may be creating false memories out of hallucinations. Rachel is a very damaged person. Her rationalization of her use and abuse of alcohol will be familiar to some/many.Megan initially has another name in Rachel's mind, but she will eventually be Megan. Megan doesn't depend on alcohol, but has a belief similar to ""if it feels good, do it."" Not very conducive to stable relationships, especially since husband Scott (who also initially has a different Rachel name) seems to be away lot. Anna is the bane of Rachel's existence and her marriage to Tom, Rachel's former husband, does not lead to the establishment of a close friendship between the two women. The contrast between the beautiful, desirable Anna and the gone-to-seed, alcoholic, and fat Rachel contributes to a jealousy based relationship.Tom is a hardworking, long suffering husband, understanding of both his wife and his ex-wife. He just wants to be helpful and kind to everyone.Throw in an almost unethical social worker and a couple of kids and we have a fast moving, interesting story. My constant question as I read was ""How is the author going to tie this together""?I was surprised."
16,Shirley,simply wow. loved it. keeps you hooked. who loved Gone Girl must go for this one. Thumbs up Paula. hope we will have more like this one.
17,Kaleigh,"i know i had a few minor complaints as i was reading this... but after closing the book i dont really remember them it all went by so fast, so, 5 stars. "
18,Tina Kaczynski,This one had me on the edge of my seat! I just couldn't wait to figure out what happened!! This will capture your interest within the first few pages and then you won't want to put it down. I heard it's coming out as a movie this year and I just can't wait! 
19,Madeline Gannon,"I listened to this book on audio... There were three narrators - one for each of the main female characters. They all did an excellent job. Especially the one who played Megan, (who, I discovered, also plays Molly Hooper on Sherlock!)...she did an especially good job narrating conversations & made them sound very authentic. The story itself was completely gripping. Told from three completely different perspectives, it came together in pieces, not creating a clear picture until the very end. I can understand the comparisons to Gone Girl, though the story is pretty different overall. But it has the same fast-paced nature that makes you want to never put it down. Really liked it. 4.5 stars."
20,Stephen Garinger,"HauntingThis is not a ghost story, though I would definitely call it haunting. There is a quality about it that that is difficult to describe, like that moment between waking and dreaming where things almost make sense, where thoughts are slippery things that refuse to be held closely yet are on the verge of comprehension.Let that not dissuade you from this marvelous novel. It is eminently comprehensible. It is just that you find yourself questioning your grasp of what is occurring every bit as much as our protagonist does. The truth seems forever just beyond reach, even as events unfold that rightfully should bring things into focus.But that is because the author skillfully weaves this tale 'around' facts, rather than through them. Our protagonist, an alcoholic woman so well written that I have to wonder if she does not come from personal experience, is victim to all the self-doubt concomitant with that state. In her realm of half remembered events and reconstructed 'reality', Rachel struggles to make sense of an event glimpsed from the window of a train. It is an event inextricably linked to her life in ways that only gradually become apparent to the reader.I found this novel fascinating. It was a mystery with more than a bit of suspense. It made me wonder what the heck was going on. It made me cringe for Rachel in her alcoholism and cheer her for her dogged persistence in solving this crime. For she does solve it. Oh, yes indeed."
21,GG,Join the craze: read Girl on the Train. I read a lot of books and don't say this lightly: This book sucked me in and wouldn't let go until I marathon-finished the book. I heard that the audiobook is narrated by 3 different people - that sounds amazing and I would also recommend it. 
22,Carlene Amaro,"This book was a frustrating read due to the main character, Rachel's, raging alcoholism. In addition, it was another of those books where one can't wholly trust the narrator's version of events, at least not at first. Although frustrating to read, the plot was interesting, and the ending was surprisingly logical with the information the reader finally has obtained.I began thinking this book would be a three star, at best, due to the unlikable characters and the lies told by the various narrators. After the initial 50-75 pages, I became hugely intrigued with with what going to happen, and to whom, and I ended up feeling like it was a very good book."
23,Chrissi,"If you love Gone Girl and all that Gillian Flynn offers in the way of crappy, unreliable narrators who make your mind whip back and forth between ""he did it; no, she did it!"", then The Girl on the Train is perfect for you. I happened to like Flynn's books, so I picked this one up as well when it came out. Loved it. I felt bad for Rachel, wanted to strangle Anna, could practically smell the sweaty, unstable Scott, felt bad (but not so very bad) for Megan, and would have done the exact same to Tom in the end. Grrr! Sociopathic! He deserved that corkscrew to the neck, but hoorah to Anna for snapping out of it in the end and helping out Rachel just a little bit. Good ending. Not the happiest, but good. "
24,Charles Ray,"Rachel takes the same train every weekday, the 8:04 from Ashbury to London, where she watches the landscape flash past, lost in the nightmares of her own tormented past. At one point, where the train slows, near where she once lived, she finds herself drawn into the lives of a couple who occupy a house near the house where she once lived with her ex-husband, Tom. Jason and Jess, as she has named them, have the perfect life she didn’t have, until one day she sees something that shatters the perfect illusion she has created. When she shares what she’s seen with the police, she finds herself drawn into the lives of the couple, and the relationship of their lives with her ex and his new wife; and no one’s life is the same afterwards.The Girl on the Train is a debut thriller by Paula Hawkins that begins like a train journey, slowly leaving the station, and gradually picking up speed as life flashes past, mostly blurs with the occasional sharp, barely remembered glance. Hawkins pulls the reader into the lives of the characters, moving from Rachel to Megan (Jess in Rachel’s mind) to Anna, her ex-husband’s new wife, in a journey that sucks you in like the muck at the bottom of a sluggish stream. This is mystery as mystery should be—with red herrings, misdirection, in a tangled line that leads inexorably to a shattering conclusion that will leave you breathless.I received this book as a gift, and after finishing it felt compelled to share my views on it. Rarely does a debut novel impress me the way this one did. Paula Hawkins is an author to watch out for."
25,Ȝayush Ȝabdullah,"I haven't felt so alive after a book in such a long time ! I know understand the hype and I understand the comparison to Gone girl and I'll have to say that in terms of plot and page turning, thus book kept me turning those pages like tomorrow wouldn't exist.. She writes so brilliantly and spins her web so magnificently, that my heart was slamming so hard against my chest whole reading the last 100 pages. She truly is taking writing to the next level, ditching that irritating style of secrets and mysteries and big revelations at the end !! I won't be forgetting about this book anytime soon "
26,Lisa Rodgers,I enjoyed this book
27,Kendra Crowe,"I wish there was a 4.5 star, but I did really like this book. Lots of mystery and suspense. Right up my alley."
28,Kathy Oldham,"This book deserves its positive reviews. Many times popular books can be over sold, but not this one. The story is vivid, and told from several points of view. This makes the reader aware of how much perception can influence opinion, and reality. Set on the fringe of London, this a book is full of intrigue. There are also threads of cringe worthy situations and creepy behaviors, which make compelling reading. The London references would be familiar to those who know the area, but are not distracting or overly imposed. In E-book form, I found each chapter using a date and time heading required attention to follow the chain of events as the story bounced around a little depending which character was speaking. Otherwise, my favorite so far this year."
29,Melody,"Wow, this book just captures you and doesn't let you go. Wasn't expecting the killer to be who it was.I'm not sure how I feel about the female characters in this book, pretty flawed. Awesome story overall."
30,Vicky Allen,Great bookI really enjoyed this book. The different characters telling their parts. It kept my interest throughout. Paula Hawkins is a very good author. I look forward to reading more of her books.
31,Sandy,"Rachel is a creative thinker who invents an imaginary life for a couple who live in a house she passes on her daily train ride into London. With few redeeming qualities herself, the reader is still drawn to Rachel with her flaws and warts. Though she never manages to come across as likable, she is nearly completely honest and aware of her negative attributes. When her path crosses with that of the couple she has only viewed from the train, her perspective changes. No one is who they seem to be, and Hawkins slowly reveals each character's skeletons one by one until and the final suspenseful scene. It is a page turner!"
32,Leanne,"I really don't know why many people didn't like the book, but I loved it! Totally get why it deserves to be on the bestsellers list. I was glued to the book and finished it in a few hours!A compulsive, fast paced, thrilling and mysterious read that had me at the edge of my seat - or more like, bed - from start to finish.The whole story showed twists and turns and I found myself in Rachel's shoes as I took tried to grasp onto what the hell was going on! The book was already written really well with it shifting POV's and though not a fan of dual, let alone triple POV's, I think Paula Hawkins managed to pull it off pretty well.What I loved the most about this book was that every character was flawed and not perfect at all. Each of them had their vices and things that made you want to hate them. And no jokes, all characters were flawed, no one a perfect husband, wife, friend,  no one. All in all, I loved reading such a fast paced book after a while and I can also say that it was a smashing, nerve wracking and crazy debut by Paula Hawkins! Now that I travel by trains everyday, I think I will be more careful of my surroundings, but then again, Mumbai trains are so crowded I can't even see the bloody sky most times. "
33,Lee Ann,A very compelling read!
34,Christie,Outstanding. This is a brilliant read. A psychological thriller that keeps you guessing till the end. I look forward to the author's next novel
35,MissSusie,"This book has had so much hype that I was honestly a little worried that it wasn't going to live up to it but holy cow did it ever.This was a twisty turny, keep you guessing to the end kind of book, with completely unreliable narrator's all three of these women were unreliable narrator's which is kind of fascinating because you never knew who was telling the truth or the truth as they saw it or are just lying completely. Every time I thought I had it figured out it would turn a different way, I thought I had it figured out many times and I never did.Told by 3 women: Rachel- alcoholic, scorned woman, she is the girl on the train and honestly quite a mess. Anna- Rachel’s ex-husbands new wife and mother of his child, self-centered and paranoid of Rachel.Megan- missing, confused, self-centered and craves attention.The three audiobook narrators Clare Corbett, Louise Brealey and India Fisher all did such a fantastic job they truly brought these women to life and endowed each with such emotion. These were all new to me narrators and I will definitely be looking for other books any of these women have narrated! This book was amazing, it was great from beginning till end never bogged down and kept me guessing all the way through. I don’t want to give any more away because this is one of those books where the wrong word could be a spoiler, suffice it to say Just Read This Book! Now!5 stars"
36,Jamie McQuiggan,"Loved everything about this book - from seeing alcoholism first hand (CRAZY) to the seed for the book in general (generally wondering about the folks you speed by and inventing histories for them.) The characters were crazy but it worked - I loved the way this book surprised me and strung me along and even though I'm tired, I'm happy it kept me up past my bedtime. An all time favorite. "
37,Debbie Krenzer,"Thank you Penguin Group and Net Galley for providing me with this e-galley in exchange for an honest review. Wow, at first I thought I was reading a book about two crazy women and I was a little disappointed. But the story soon revealed their challenges that they were facing and they weren't as crazy as I first thought. The author really takes you deep into these characters and over the course if the story you feel many different emotions. I spent most if the book going back and forth over which character actually did the killing. It was great! I love when you can't figure out who done it. And when it was revealed I was in total shock. This book really reminded me of ""Gone Girl"" in many instances. It's one of those you can't put down. Unfortunately I had to and found myself wishing like all get out that I could get back to it. A real page turner that you will not predict the ending. A definite must read!"
38,SophieDoodles,"There are some books that you immerse yourself in instantly. Books that, even when you aren't reading them, you're thinking about them, constantly. Books that play on your mind, make you wonder, poke your inquisitive nature. There are books that have you staying up late, just to read one more chapter, and books that you tell your friends to read once you've read it. 

This is one of those books.

This book is predominantly narrated by Rachel, although the book is split between three women who's lives all interlink in some way. Rachel, Megan, and Anna. Rachel introduces herself whilst on the train she catches daily, commuting home from her busy day in London. Only Rachel isn't focused on her job, her long journey home, or her family. She's focused on the lives of ""Jess"" and ""Jason"" - a young couple whom she has personified and live on the street that Rachel and her ex husband used to share two years ago.. 
Rachel looks out for ""Jess"" and ""Jason"" daily, becoming obsessed with them and daydreaming about their perfect life together (a life that the book suggests Rachel would very much like for herself) - Until one day she reads in the paper that Jess - real name Megan - has gone missing, and that her husband Scott is the prime suspect. Rachel decides to tip off the police following an event she witnessed the day before Megan disappeared. 
However Rachel is an alcoholic. She is irrational, prone to blackouts and drunk dialling her ex Tom and his new wife Anna whom live down the street from Megan and her husband. The police dismiss her as a rubbernecker almost immediately, but Rachel is not that easily deterred, and is keen to involve herself as much as possible in the case as to find out what really happened to Megan. But the more she finds out about the missing woman, the less she likes her.
Overall, the characters in this book are all pretty dislikable. Rachel is weak, self-pitying and unnecessarily nosey; fat, addicted to alcohol, and physically less attractive than either Megan or Anna. Megan is a liar and cheat, beautiful and bored - constantly looking for new thrill at the expense of others. And Anna is a competitive, vindictive trouble maker who seems to want nothing more than to make Rachel's life as miserable as possible, while hiding behind the husband she stole from her in the first place. The men are by no means better however; Scott is controlling a violent behind the facade of his and Megan's perfect life, and Tom plays mind games and lies to get exactly what he needs from whoever he wants. In fact the only nice person in the entire book appears to be Rachel's best friend from university Cathy, who spends the entire book asking Rachel to cut down drinking and improve her situation, helping her along and generally picking up after her. 
This book is very cleverly written from three perspectives of three different women. Suspense builds from the first few chapters, along with empathy that would not otherwise be expected from such an unusual and dislikable main character. I definitely recommend! :) "
39,Penny Mccreight,"Twists and turns and flashbacks made for quite a read. Good writing, stands on its own, but of course begs for comparisons to Gone Girl."
40,Tracy Kushman finegan,Amazing book! I love the way just when you think you have it all figured out there is a new twist that keeps you guessing. 
41,Brendan Oshida," The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins Rachel rides the train everyday. She observes her surroundings, one of them being the happy couple she names Jason and Jess. She struggles seeing them so happy, after her recent breakup with her boyfriend, Tom. She handles this breakup with the usage of alcohol, but on one night, she is a complete drunken mess. A few days after, the police start investigating the disappearance of Megan Hipwell. Rachel fears she has done something, and starts to unravel the dangerous plot that has been covered up. 	I really enjoyed reading this book because it was fast-paced and suspenseful. It was full of twists and turns. One example of this is when the reader finds out that Tom was the one who murdered Megan. I at first thought that Megan and Tom only had a neutral relationship. Another aspect of the novel that I liked was how dark the plot became. As the story starts, you think it is all happy and cheerful, but as the plot progresses forward, the dark web of events that occurred come to light. This novel is definitely for a more mature audience, around the age of fifteen."
42,Tricia Saucier,"I am not one for murder mysteries, etc. but this one sucked me in. Great read and I highly recommend."
43,Ptaylor,"Very hard to put down. The characters are not especially liikeable, but we know them. We know people like them. A fast read. Highly recommended. "
44,Daniela Brösel,"Jeden Tag pendelt Rachel morgens mit dem Zug nach London und dieser hält meist an der gleichen Stelle auf der Strecke an. Dabei sieht sie in einem Vorgarten oft ein junges Paar, dass sie Jess und Jason nennt. Für Rachel hat es den Anschein, als führen die beiden ein perfektes Leben, genau so eines, wie sie es sich selbst wünscht. So wird der Blick durch die Fensterscheibe des Zugs zur täglichen Routine, Jess und Jason ein Teil ihres Lebens. Eines Tages beobachtet Rachel etwas Schockierendes und liest kurz darauf in der Zeitung vom Verschwinden einer Frau: Jess. Sie kommt nicht umhin es der Polizei zu melden und bringt damit Ereignisse in Gang, denen sie nicht mehr entkommt.Mit Werbeaussagen wie „Dieser Thriller ist nicht zu stoppen“ wird ‚Girl on the Train’ derzeit angepriesen. Meiner Erfahrung nach sind diese Bücher mit solchen Versprechen, samt „vorab verkauften Filmrechten“, entweder absolut gerechtfertigt, oder das genaue Gegenteil: Nur ganz heiße Luft. Ich für meinen Teil bin mit sehr hohen Erwartungen an den Titel von Paula Hawkins herangegangen – 448 Seiten und nicht mal 36 Stunden später, war es trotz Arbeitstag auch schon inhaliert.Das Buch erzählt abwechselnd aus der Sicht von drei Frauen, hauptsächlich jedoch von Rachel, die mit sich selbst und dem Alkohol mal mehr, mal weniger Probleme hat. Perfekt gewählt ist hierbei die verwendete Ich-Form, denn dadurch lernt man die Gedanken und Ansichten von ihr viel deutlicher und näher kennen, ist absolut rasant von der Geschichte eingenommen und möchte auch nicht aufhören, ehe man die Auflösung kennt. Was hat Rachel mit der verschwundenen „Jess“ zu tun und war die beobachtete Beziehung mit Jason doch nicht so perfekt?Von Flashbacks des Alkoholkonsums geplagt, wird nicht nur Rachel sondern auch der Leser von mal zu mal tiefer in die Irre und immer weiter zu neuen Wahrheiten geführt, jedoch nie so schlimm, dass man den roten Faden verliert. Chapeau, Frau Hawkins. Dieses Buch ist wie ein Puzzle, in dem jedes Stück genutzt wurde und das nur mit dem letzten, finalen Teil komplett und zufriedenstellend ist. Eine Auflösung, mit der ich nie gerechnet hätte.Es ist nicht unbedingt etwas für zarte Gemüter. Die Gedanken und Emotionen sind mit einer Handvoll gewalttätigen Übergriffen relativ deutlich geschildert. Vor allem der „Thrill“ mit psychologischer Tiefe lässt die Luft zum Atmen manchmal ganz schön dünn werden.Wow, was für ein Psycho-Spiel! Wenn die Bahn das nächste Mal zu spät kommt, kann man nur hoffen, dass es so lange dauert, bis man ‚Girl on the Train’ fertig gelesen hat."
45,Neville,"The Girl on the Train is a refreshingly original, addictive thriller. Told from the perspective of three female characters, predominantly an ex-wife with voyeuristic and alcoholic tendencies. It's a mystery that unfolds in suburban London where commuter trains roll and stop along the sedentary backyards of houses that are filled with memories, marital bliss and conflicts. Houses with husbands and wives, nannies, babies and lies. Told with staggered timelines, a woman goes missing, one with a storied past. The husband is a suspect, or maybe it's her therapist, or could it be the lonely divorcee? Or maybe, it was the mysterious ginger-haired man on the train? Chapter after chapter, we're like rail commuters, rolling along the tracks, back and forth. With stops and starts, twists and turns. Memory lapses, jealousies, betrayals. It's quite a ride. 'Girl on a Train' captures its characters emotions and thoughts flawlessly. A superb first novel by Paula Hawkins and is just the ticket for an engrossing, page-turning read - so good, you might miss your stop on the train commute home, or work. "
46,Ellen Broadhurst,"What a vile, dreadful book, full of miserable nonredeemable people. If you despised Gone Girl, do not read this book. Five stars, I know, for a book I really did not ""enjoy"" might seem odd, but, the author did a *great* job; the story was compelling and rather well written, despite the fact that there was not a single character you could root for in the entire book. Overall, I found the ending a bit hard to swallow, and yet, it made for a great finish. Sometimes, showmanship isn't such a terrible thing, and I was able to suspend my disbelief and track along. It is meant to be fiction, you know. This is also one of those books that is made better as an audio listen. Several reviewers mention that the three characters narrating the story were flat, and were hard to differentiate on the written page. The three narrators who read the audio version were absolutely spot on brilliant. I do not like books ""dramatized"" by readers who attempt to give a book the feeling of a play, 'acting out' parts; these readers were narrating in the first person, so we were just hearing their thoughts, and each reader did a terrific job in bring her individual character to life. Overall, I'd highly recommend it to anyone who really enjoyed Gone Girl; for those who didn't, well, it's the same sort of thing, so consider yourself forewarned. "
47,Laura Thompson,"I read this in a day. The book is as compulsively readable as Gone Girl,and for all the same reasons. Compelling, imperfect characters, murky plot points that materialize out of the gloom, agonizingly, deliciously, and then a rocket of an ending. Satisfying, but not completely tidy, either. Very, very well done. great book. I was sad to finish it."
48,Angeline Peterson,"I could not put this book down; I read it in less than a day. There's not much you can say about this book without giving the plot away, but I really enjoyed reading something from the point of view of a character as deeply flawed and tragic as Rachel. You feel her embarrassment, sorrow, and hopelessness in every word and, in a cathartic way, it's refreshing. She's real, raw.It's one of those that just starts and has you questioning, ""WHAT IS HAPPENING?"" throughout a good portion of the book. Highly recommend it!"
49,Liz Maddox,"Loved it!! It's crazy, and I'm surprised how much I adored Rachael. She's always so down on herself (and an alcoholic), but she's just so real. This book is like Gone Girl in that I couldn't put it down. The twists are delicious....read it friends, read it NOW!!!"
50,Krissy," **2015 Reading Challenge W/Josh: #4 A Book Published This Year**Holy shit. This book was amazing! It has been compared to Gone Girl but I hated Gone Girl. This book was so much better! I listened to the audiobook and I have to give props to all 3 of the narrators. They were perfect. Just perfect. Many people only gave this book 4 stars saying that it was because none of the characters were likable. But I actually loved that about the book. All of the characters were a hot mess. Each in their own way. And I ate it up. 
I could not put this book down. I would have easily listened to this in one sitting if real life (and kids) didn't keep interrupting me. Sometimes it sucks being an adult with responsibilities. "
51,Christi Mccoy,Wow! I can't believe that this was her first thriller. This story kept me on the edge of my seat! The twists and turns were amazing.
52,Kelly Bonwick,"I've taken time out fro reading for a while. What a book to come back to! I couldn't put it down a d read the whole thing in two sessions. Granted, I was on a train myself both times.... I've seen a one star rating, stating how everyone was a big hot mess. Each to their own. I don't think you realise everyone is a mess right away and it slowly twists and turns. And actually, if anything it makes you sympathise with people who are. Don't trust anyone and think before you judge. We've all sat across someone and thought about their lives might be like, if they're happy or smelt the alcohol on someone's breath and turned away in disgust. Well, think no further, sink into the life of Rachel, Anna and Megan. This book is full of secrets and a real hidden gem in the world of crime and thrillers."
53,Krystin Rachel,"5 glorious gold stars!I debated reading this book for a while. I hate being a bandwagon jumper of what's SO POPULAR right now. I resisted Game of Thrones for four seasons before caving - turns out people like it for a reason (*cough Jon Snow cough*). This book has so many 4 and 5 star ratings and so many pronouncements about ""the next Gone Girl Oh Em Gee!!!!"" and so many Debbie Downers who just didn't get what all the fuss is about (which is usually me, let's be honest here)...that I couldn't decide what to do. So, when the e-book went on a limited 24-hour sale for $5 I decided to get it and just read the damn thing already... I wanted to finished this book by eating it. I just loved it so much, I needed it inside of me. But, you can't eat PDF files.I won't go over the synopsis too much as others already have, more deftly then I ever could. But I have to talk about Rachel, Megan and Anna. The book is told from the perspective of each of them. And they are all horrible people. But they are real. And I saw myself in each of them for different reasons. I've been depressed and self loathing like Rachel, in my own head and obsessive. I've been the new wife like Anna, just wanting the ex-wife to stop being so goddamn crazy and disappear from our lives. And I've been excerpts of Megan, fighting the urge to run away from a life that didn't feel right anymore. For the 7 hours it took me to read this book, these women were my reason for living. My husband didn't exist to me. Sorry, baby. The Drunk. Rachel is the most pathetic, despondent and miserable character I have ever known. So dependent on others for her happiness that she's lonely. And so lonely because she's dependent on others for her happiness: her ex-husband Tom who she still loves and won't leave alone, the baby she can't conceive and ""Jess and Jason"" - the couple she's never met but obsesses over to the point she develops an emotional relationship with them in her head. She's a blackout drunk drowning in gin-and-tonic and wine and gaining depression fat (been there), turning herself into someone she doesn't even like. But she can't stop - the hole she's dug herself into is just too deep. She's jobless, running out of money and just plain weird, cringe-worthyly so. Like, just so So SO weird. It's hard to read her sometimes, but you can't not because as repulsive as she is, she's also gravitational. It's a masterpiece of a character study. The Bitch. Anna is, without even reading a word of her narration, immediately unlikable. You already know she's Tom's mistress. He left Rachel, married Anna, moved her into the house Rachel loved and had the baby Rachel always wanted. In some ways, Anna is the reason Rachel is divorced and fat and even more drunk then she was during her marriage. When we meet Anna she's a new mom and relegated housewife, recalling the good ole' memories of when she was the hot mistress fucking some other woman's husband - a woman she never had to care about - and the chick who turned heads walking down the street. Since marrying Tom everything has changed. Rachel is harassing/stalking them all the time, Anna's scared for her child (because Rachel may or may not have tried to kidnap the rugrat,) she hates living in Rachel's old house and she hates that she's become boring. Her sex life is lacking, she puts no effort into her appearance and worries about money. The glamour of being the mistress has disappeared. But while complaining she lets you know she wouldn't have it any other way. She loves her daughter so much, it's okay that she no longer has her career or body or sex appeal. And she feels confident in her marriage, even during the more difficult times. Tom will take care of whatever the problem is, and she believes everything he says. The more you read of her, the more she develops into a character you sympathize with, despite still not liking her at all. The Liar. Then there's Megan. Damnit Megan! Her chapters are set months before Rachel and Anna's. Megan is Rachel's ""Jess"". Her husband, Scott, is ""Jason"". The perfect couple. Beautiful and so in love, you can tell all the way from the train where Rachel watches them. Megan, at first, is just as Rachel would hope she was. But as the book progresses the real Megan is revealed to the reader, as well as to Rachel. She's is not the perfect blonde beauty with the perfect marriage and perfect husband. She's anxious, struggling with insomnia and constantly fighting this desire to run away from her life. She cheats on her husband, swearing she can't help herself. She lies about what she's been through, where she is and who she's with. Scott really has no idea what is wrong with her, so he suggest a therapist. She starts seeing Dr. Abdic, revealing her dark history and the tragic mistake that still keeps her up at night. But she can't tell Scott any of this. She refuses. Her marriage starts to crumble, irrevocably. She starts experiencing transference, thinking she's in love with Dr. Abdic who listens to her and never judges her and is always there for her. Then Megan goes missing. And the mystery of where she is, and who could have hurt her, splits into a million different directions. Leaving your head spinning as Hawkins drops diverting clues, one right after the other. There wasn't a character in this book that I didn't suspect at some point - 7 in total, including Megan herself because that's just the kind of book it is. Rachel is pulled into the investigation, unable to let it go after pieces of memories convince her she knows something about Megan's disappearance. Seeing herself as some savior for Scott because ""they always suspect the husband"" and Jason is such a good man he couldn't possibly have hurt Jess, Rachel weasels her way into Scott's life and watches as he learns he didn't know his wife at all. Anna and Tom are pulled into the investigation because of Rachel. The cops think she crazy, Anna thinks she's dangerous, Tom is exhausted by her, Scott slowly unravels her lies and Rachel questions everything - unsure of what she really knows, because her drunken blackouts have her confused and missing chunks of time. The Girl on the Train is a fascinating, compelling page-turner that NEVER slowed down. I've read this faster than I've read anything else this year. It's full of secrets and misdirection and the characters are straight addictive, like heroin. The overall plot is about what happened to Megan and the people involved, but on a much broader scale it's about the concept of taking a woman's whole essence and reducing her down to simply ""a wife and mother"", and the kinds of ways that can mess a person up when she can't fulfill those roles the way society expects her to. And it puts a spotlight on the fact that you can never know what goes on behind closed doors; you can never know a person based on judgments from a conversation or appearance, or even, if you've lived with that person for years. My only gripe would be that the ending felt flat/abrupt. But I'll be the first to admit I don't know if that's because it actually was flat/abrupt, or if I just wasn't ready for it to end. I'll think about it and if I decide no, it was actually a disappointing ending, then I'll knock those 5 stars down to 4. But until then... Run an I.V. and hook this book to my veins, I NEED it! "
54,Judi/Judith Riddle,"After a devastating divorce Rachel moves in with a girlfriend in the suburbs of London and commutes into the city, back and forth on the train, daily. As the train passes the house that she used to live in she is devastated that her ex-husband, Tom, is still there with his new wife Anna and their baby. Desperately missing her previous married life she focuses on the seemingly ideal couple who she names James and Jess who live near Tom and Anna. While she lives a good portion of her life under the influence of alcohol she is confused as to what is real and what is not. Shortly after Rachael discovers the perfect couple, Jess all of a sudden, disappears. Suddenly Rachael has a purpose in life as she sets out to discover what happened to the missing Jess. Slowly the author weaves a tale of mystery as Rachael makes the mistake of going to the police in a drunken state while she quickly becomes the object of their attention.The story takes off at breakneck speed through the narrations of the three women, Rachael, Anna, and Jess/Megan with just enough hints scattered here and there to keep me gasping as I read. I lost sleep, my eyes burned, and yet I read on. The women are allowed to rage and avenge as they slowly uncover the secrets between them and Rachel’s creepy husband as the lies keep flowing entangling the four of them. Although none of the characters are likable they are curiously addictive not to mention so very much fun to read about. With each trip of the train bits of Rachael are revealed in this riveting but disturbing story. I couldn’t help but cheer for Rachael every time she made a positive move and my heart broke for her when she took a dive. I started to give this book four stars but because Rachael is such a memorable character I had to give myself a week to think about it and I then knew it was deserved five stars because it was the best psychological thriller I have read in a long time! DreamWorks has recently acquired the movie rights for The Girl on the Train."
55,Stephanie,"I couldn't put this book down! If you liked Gone Girl, definitely move this book to the top of your list. Some of the characters were a bit irritating - but it was a quick read and definitely kept me interested to the very end. "
56,Kara Zajac,"This book is suspenseful and compelling, I didn't want to put it down. Rachel, the girl on the train, is someone who almost everyone can relate to at some point in their lives. She is very real and likable. Rachel is suffering the loss of her marriage two years ago, drowning in her own self pity, exasperated by excessive behaviors. When a local woman goes missing, Rachel can't remember all of her actions that night. The story turns into a case of who done it with an unexpected twist. I loved the plot and connected with the characters."
57,aPriL does feral sometimes,"Alcoholic, newly divorced Rachel Watson is riding the train in to London from Ashbury, where she rents a room from her last and now only friend, Kathy. As usual, she drunkenly anticipates seeing her favorite couple in their backyard and in their house, curtains open. They apparently own the house, surrounded by similar cookie-cutter family homes which abut the track, separated by a fence. It has become her only pleasure to see them share kisses and hugs, unaware of the audience watching them from the passing train, which temporarily stops in front of the house almost every day for a track signal. The canned gin and tonics she discretely sips all day kills her emotional pain, but it is not a pleasure as good as watching this handsome couple. The liquor only dulls her regrets. She has named the loving, happy couple 'Jess and Jason'. She feels connected to them, obsessed with their happiness. So when on yet another fruitless job-hunting farce of a train journey, which she is enduring daily to fool her roommate into thinking she actually still has her public relations job instead of having been fired, she becomes panicked when see observes 'Jess' kissing another man.Four doors down from 'Jess and Jason' live Tom Watson and his brand new wife, Anna, who was a restaurant server, in an identical house with the same layout as the blissful couple Rachel cannot stop watching. This house used to be Tom and Rachel's house, but after a pregnancy miscarriage and Rachel's descent into excessive drinking and blackouts, Tom moved on to Anna, who quickly had a baby.Rachel is drifting in meaningless haze of movement masquerading as forward progress much like the train she rides back and forth on its unmoving rails. Tom wants her to really move on, and Kathy thinks she is going to work every day, even as she is losing sympathy for Rachel over her increasing erratic and irresponsible behavior as well as her endless drunkeness. Rachel has no plan. She does not care about getting a new job. All she wants to do is get drunk, and watch her favorite couple as she rides the morning and evening train from London. However, she is running out of money. She has embarrassing blackouts which are getting her into trouble she does not remember causing, such as midnight calls to Tom, threats to Anna, and finally she apparently tried to steal Anna and Tom's baby out of their house, which she invaded uninvited.Then one day she wakes up covered in blood and bruises with no memory of the previous night.Megan (Jess) Hipwell is at loose ends. She closed her art gallery due to lack of customers, and now she is looking for something to occupy her life. Unlike the fantasy of bliss that Rachel has created for her, she is restless and unhappy in her marriage to Scott (Jason). Out of pure boredom and unable to move on to new career, she decides to work as a nanny for Anna and Tom. It is a dull and unfulfilling job. What she actually wants is an affair. When her inability to sleep morphs into daily panic attacks and nervous anxiety, she finally goes to see a therapist. The psychiatrist is not exactly helpful in her opinion, but he is very good looking. Very. Then, Scott comes home one day and Megan is gone. Where is Megan? He calls the police.Anna, a nervous young mother, wants Rachel arrested. She has no doubt Rachel is dangerous, violent and unpredictable. She is uncertain (not that she admits it) of Tom's love, despite his assurances, because Tom keeps rescuing and excusing Rachel. Rachel is obviously a continuing threat to her baby and her marriage. After Megan disappears, Anna discovers Rachel is hanging about in front of their house, supposedly trying to find out more information about Megan. Why would Rachel care about Megan, their ex-babysitter? It is obvious to her Rachel wants Tom back. Well. She is not having it! She is going to see that woman pays for her continuing disruption to her life.I think this book is wonderfully entertaining and quite an interesting twisty mystery. The story slowly picks up speed like a train leaving a train station, but its pace becomes G-force quick until a scary and satisfying finish is reached(view spoiler)[, despite a slight drop in speed at the end as a character decides to explain certain confusions which acted like a tap on the brakes (hide spoiler)].There are reviewers who believe this story compares to 'Gone Girl', but I do not think so. It is fun, with surprises and shocks suddenly directing the reader into suspecting first this character, then that character, as responsible for Megan's disappearance. There is even a possible red-headed suspect Rachel meets on the train (a redheaded red herring?) Rachel is not sure that she did not do something bad! I guess if other readers think this is like 'Gone Girl', and it serves to interest people in reading the book (not that I can see there is anyone who has not already read this book, if going by the number of GR reviews previously posted before me is any clue), then I join in the chorus to recommend this novel because it is a tricky and character-driven mystery, whatever other book it may resemble (I do not agree it is another 'Gone Girl', however). I CAN agree with everyone who thinks this a fun and exciting book. I read (listened) straight through for hours to finish the last half. Wow, is this story a thriller in the last chapters..."
58,Susan Lynch,I loved this book and could not put it down. Very much like Gone Girl which I also really loved reading.
59,Omid Majidy Pour,اولین نکته ای که تو این کتاب نظرمو جلب کرد، این بود که روی جلد نوشته که این کتاب رکود هر پاتر رو شکسته! اولش گفتم خوب دوباره بازی با اعداد و کلمات انتشارات هست ولی نه اینطور نیست، کتاب عالیه!حدودا 50 60 صفحه می کشه تا داستان و شخصیت ها جا بیافتن، اوایل کتاب یکم کتاب معمولی بنظر می یاد و سرد، اما با پیش رفتن کم کم ورق بر می گرده.داستان راوی های متفاوت داره و هر فصل از زبان یکی از راوی ها بیان میشه، سه زن در این کتاب نقش راوی رو بازی می کنن. یکی دائم الخمر یکی عاشق زندگیش و یکی معمولی ولی تقریبا افسرده! اول کتاب کاملا از هم جدا و مستقل هستن ولی با پیش رفتن کم کم هر سه نقطه داستان به هم نزدیک و نزدیک تر میشن و بالاخره توی 30 صفحه آخر کتاب معما حل میشه و همه نقطه ها به هم میرسن.یکی از نکات جذاب این کتاب، متفاوت بودن دید هر شخصیت نسبت به یک اتفاقه، یک اتفاقی که هر کدوم از راوی ها اون رو اونطوری که خودش برداشت کرده تعریف و درک می کنه ولی در آخر کتاب اصلا معمای اصلی اونی نیست که خواننده فکر می کرده باید باشه! و این جذاب می کنه خوندن کتاب روکتاب می تونست حتی طولانی تر و کشدار تر باشه، می تونست پایان داستان و فاش شدن معما یکم بیشتر طول بکشه ولی خوبی این موضوع اینه که خواننده اصلا خسته نمیشه.خیلی ساده اگه بخوام توضیح بدم، این کتاب به معنای واقعی کلمه حس کنجکاوی خواننده رو تحریک می کنه و یا باید یک نفس بخونید کتاب رو، یا تموم زمان هایی که کتاب دستتون نیست مدام دارید بهش فکر می کنید! :))پنج ستاره کامل، حقشه، کتاب عالیه، توصیه می کنم بخونید...
60,Mary Elizabeth,Top book of 2015. 
61,Elisabeth,"Every day is the same for Rachel. She catches the train, it stops at a signal, she sees a couple in their house by the tracks. After a while Rachel feels that she knows this couple ‘Jess and Jason’ as she calls them. She gets used to seeing them at their window, in the garden and behaving like any other young couple in love. A perfect relationship – Rachel wishes her life could be like that.One day, the train stops as usual at the same signal but Rachel glimpses something shocking that will change everything she thinks about ‘Jess and Jason’.Soon Rachel has the opportunity to become part of the life ‘Jess and Jason’ lead….soon they will get to know Rachel for who she is and no longer just ‘the girl on the train’. This is a gripping book which made me just want to keep reading and reading. The story is told from the point of view of 3 main characters which is part of what kept me hooked. I really hope that this book is just the first of many good books from Paula Hawkins – I will be definitely be waiting with bated breath for her second book."
62,Liberty K,"Weird shit is happening in this book guys, WEIRD SHIT! I really like the fact that all the characters in this book is so dark and problematic and it is certainly one of the books that you talk about to friends hoping that they will read it because you want so bad to talk about it with someone who experienced the emotional rollercoaster that this book provides. I read few chapters while listening to Gone Girl soundtrack and it was sooo amazing and spooky! Can't wait for the movie!"
63,Allie,"I had heard a lot of talk that if you were a fan of ""Gone Girl"" you would be a fan of ""The Girl On The Train"" -- I agree! I loved them both and found that they had several similarities to me (pretty much all of the main characters in both books I despised. While I did feel sorry for Rachel in ""The Girl On The Train"", I also didn't particularly like her), but each also had enough stark differences from the other that it was easy for me to enjoy reading both of them for different reasons. Even though I disliked most of the characters in Paula Hawkins novel, I still couldn't help but keep reading. It's dark, haunting, and depressing psychological thriller, but an incredible effective read thanks to the wonderful writing skills of Hawkins. This is definitely a novel that divulges into the behaviors and inner working minds of people -- their motives, actions, and reasons behind them. The story itself is told from the viewpoints of three different women: Rachel, Megan, and Anne. All three of these women are unreliable, and each has their own secrets to hide. The main character is Rachel, who takes a train into London each day that rides right past her old neighborhood. From the window of the train, Rachel sees not only her old house (as well as reminded of her past, happy life), but also the house and daily activities of a couple who resides down the street from her previous home. In her mind, Rachel has given the couple names, Jess and Jason, and imagined their perfect life in her mind. When real life does not live up to the fantasy Rachel has created in her head, she becomes entangled in a murder case that takes place and also twisted her into her past life she left behind. A perfect book to read if you are looking for a darker, not necessarily happy tale. "
64,Elisa Garcia,This book reminded me of Gone Girl. The ending was totally unexpected. I enjoyed the suspense trying to tie all the knots and connecting all the characters. For a minute I thought Rachel had multiple personalities.
65,Phyllis Lautenschlaeger,"The Girl on the Train: A Thriller It is such a gradual approach, the reality of this book. At first watching the troubled behavior of an alcoholic woman made more real by this author's absolutely astounding grasp on alcoholism and how it affects one. I thought that was to be the subject matter of the book. Then the creepy feeling that there is so much more evil in this book than first meets the eye. Bizarre acts after compulsive behavior make this a page turner you can't put down. This book makes for a mental disturbance equal to the train that that roars down the tracks, making a setting for murder. I strongly recommend this book."
66,Grace Cantwell,Simply put a Great read. 
67,Linda Strong,"Since there have been hundreds of reviews done on this one, MY review will be short and sweet.when I started reading, I was a bit underwhelmed. I didn't like the characters at all. One was a whiney alcoholic still bemoaning the fact that her husband had cheated on her two years previously. I just wanted to shake some sense into her. Then I met the ex-husband ... jerk of the year. His present wife comes across as a weakling .. yes, dear; no dear; whatever you say, dear. *shudders*.But as I got deeper and deeper into the book, I realized that even though these characters had no redeeming qualities as far as I could see, they were actually interesting. And I was getting more and more involved into the story.Bottom Line ... this one's a winner ...this one merits 5 stars all on its own. "
68,Harvee," I think it's a terrific women's fiction story complicated or compimented by murder and psychological intrigue. Two married women are haunted - one by the inability to have a child and by the resultant break up of her marriage, and the other by a secret she keeps close to her chest. Their lives intersect through a third married woman and all the men in their lives. I don't want to give the plot away, but let me say it was an almost perfect thriller. Not sure Anna was in character at the very end, however. "
69,Nam Nguyen,"It's been awhile since I read a book this fast, 3 days straight IMO with 3 hours each, I've been hooked by the thrill of finding who was the killer of Megan but most importantly I wanted to see how life would change its course for Rachel. Whenever I read a story that starts with such a great endurance of pain and sadness I know something good is gonna happened. There is always good in people, and a lot of effort will show it. There is always meaning in everything we do, even by some instinct. I think I can just skip Gone Girl after reading this first."
70,Meagan Senesac,"4.5 stars maybe? I definitely had trouble putting this down but thought the end was not quite as good as the rest of it. I also thought parts of it were slow. Overall, I recommend this book. "
71,Jen,"With some of the books I see on the bestseller list, I am wary that they will be overrated and I will be disappointed, as this happens quite often. I'm happy to say that was not the case with this story. This was not your run-of-the-mill mystery - it kept my interest to the very end. Well-written and highly recommend."
72,Lauren Reed,"Thriller books/movies seem to be ""in"" right now, and when someone recommended that I read this book I was expecting another Gone Girl or Serena. This book was similar to those others in someways and completely different in others. I loved that the narrator was so unreliable, being a depressed drunk, you were figuring out the plot with her, she didn't know anymore than you did. Basically a woman, Rachel, is torn apart by a divorce and the inability to have children. She rides the train to London every morning passing by a house were a seemingly happy couple lives-- she has named them Jason and Jess. One day she finds out Jess, whose real name is Megan, has gone missing. Feeling connect to Jess/Megan because she has been watching her from the train feels the need to help solve the mystery. Not only is this a hard mystery to crack, but Rachel's own limitations, hinder her ability remember, and be taken seriously by law enforcement. This book had me guessing until the very end in true thriller form, and I loved it! "
73,June,Be prepared to be swept into a seriously riveting story. Nothing is what it seems and no one is who you think they are. 
74,Mary Beth,So good! Guessed the killer partway but still was not certain. Really great thriller.
75,Jo Ann ,"I know this debut novel is being compared to Gone Girl, but I enjoyed this one a whole lot more. You kept me guessing till almost the very end, ""Well done Ms. Hawkins!"" "
76,Claire Malcolm,"Brilliant Book. Definitely 5 Stars. Unfortunately, I found that all the characters are extremely 'unlikable'!"
77,Jenia,"A debut psychological thriller that will forever change the way you look at other people's lives.Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning. Every day she rattles down the track, flashes past a stretch of cozy suburban homes, and stops at the signal that allows her to daily watch the same couple breakfasting on their deck. She’s even started to feel like she knows them. “Jess and Jason,” she calls them. Their life—as she sees it—is perfect. Not unlike the life she recently lost.And then she sees something shocking. It’s only a minute until the train moves on, but it’s enough. Now everything’s changed. Unable to keep it to herself, Rachel offers what she knows to the police, and becomes inextricably entwined in what happens next, as well as in the lives of everyone involved. Has she done more harm than good? I have seen quite few people on metro reading  The Girl on the Train  in the past few weeks and it seemed to be pretty popular top of it. After reading the novel, I can see why so many people are talking about it. It’s thrilling, mysterious and you can’t help but wonder what happens with characters next. Of course from moment that Megan goes missing, it has the reader wondering, who is behind it. Who is the reason that she went missing in the first place? It’s a type of thriller that has you wondering who the real killer is. I enjoyed fact that novel was written in multiple point of views, so that way you got view of each different character. Megan. Rachel and even Anna. Also the fact that two of the characters had their issues, and at times the reader couldn’t help but wonder, if what they are saying is actually true. I did think it was cool, that all that started with Rachel taking a train, considering when I started reading this, I was on metro on way to work. It made the story a bit different, those other psychological thrillers that I had read in the past.  Rachel. Megan  : Despite their issues, I couldn’t seem to help but love them. Maybe it was because in a way I felt sorry for both of them. In a way, both of them can relate to one another, because both of them felt like they didn’t belong anywhere. Otherwise why would Megan have an affair? If she was happy with Scott. There must been a reason for it. Once I saw how Scott was with Rachel once he found she lied, I could see why she did, though Tom was no better. Her therapist seemed to be the only one who even cared; I can see why she grew to like him. He really cared about Megan, even if he didn’t admit it; I just had that feeling that he did. As for Rachel, I can’t blame her for drinking, after everything that she went through. Honestly I don’t know how she was able to handle way she did. Considering she disliked Anna, she still came, to warn her once she put clues together about Tom. That takes a lot, to go to woman that your husband left you for. It takes courage. Tom was last person I suspected, even I didn’t see it coming. But once Anna mentioned that he lied a lot, in way I started suspect that something was off, but never did I think that he was one who killed Megan. That’s another thing that I loved about this novel, it had so much suspense in it, and twists and turns that even the reader didn’t see coming. It took me a day to finish this book because I didn’t want to put it down. I wanted to see why Megan went missing, if Rachel actually had something do with it, what actually happened that night? Most of all I wanted to see how all of it would come to end. It was unlike anything that I had expected. I was blown away by the story, the characters. It’s hard to believe that it was her debut novel, It’s an author that I am going be looking forward to. An Extraordinary Journey. "
78,Katie Van Alyne,Super thrilling and a great mystery. I would say even better than Gone Girl
79,Christina,"Edit - 10/4/2015:Almost a month and a half after my initial review, I'm coming back and bumping this up to 4.5 stars (rounded to 5 on Goodreads). I have not been able to get this book out of my head! I keep randomly thinking of how engaged I was during this one and looking for more thrillers to read that will hopefully compare to it. As I mentioned, I was not a huge fan of the genre before reading this bok, so I can safely say that this book single-handedly turned me onto thrillers and in my book, that's worthy of much higher than the rating I originally gave it.---Original Review - 8/23/2015:This was a solid 3.75 stars for me. Mysteries and thrillers normally aren't my cup of tea, but I enjoyed this one a fair bit. Some of the characters really grated on my nerves, but I'm not sure if they were intentionally written to be disliked or if I just disliked them. I enjoyed the fact that this book dealt with some heavy issues along the way of the main plot without being super overbearing about it. I was a little bit disappointed with how the main plot line ended, but that didn't hamper my overall enjoyment of the book too terribly much. "
80,Christine,"A great read, un-put-downable and a page turner to the end. I enjoyed the diary format and the simultaneous narratives, structured around the train journey and the single location. It has a consistent economy of style, it's right to the point, at times visceral, with nothing wasted and I felt this worked well, particularly for the content and theme. It's a contemporary novel, with a fast pace and sense of suspense throughout; as good a thriller a you'll have read in a long time. Great début, look forward to more!"
81,E.B.,I am never getting married.
82,Angelica Francisco,"wow. i didnt see that coming. rachel has always been the character that i rooted for since i started reading. she is desperate, damaged and lonely. what she did wrong was love somebody else first rather than herself. anna? fuck hated her till the end. what a hoebag. i just cannot take it when people cheat. and megan. she's just really screwed. she loved herself too much but at least she wanted to be a better person for her unborn child. gawd and tom dont even get me started. one of the best books i have read since gone girl. and i am not surprised how crazy these people are. i work in a stressful environment and i could understand how these people become damaged as they are. so i found the darkness of the book entertaining and intruiging."
83,Cece,This was the best book I've read all year!
84,Lynn Monaco,Very readable book with an unreliable protagonist that keeps you wondering. I enjoyed it!
85,Nicole Kelly,Amazing book! Could not put it down!!
86,Denise Emily," WOW!>I was so excited to read this book when I read the description on Goodreads. I am so glad that I got the chance to read this book! I love the way Paula Hawkins gives a little of each woman's words throughout the story. Rachel is a mess, but I like her. She just couldn't let Tom go and eventually that caught up with her. I hope really that she stops her drinking because she does some crazy mess when she's drunk. Megan's story and past is so sad, I thought I was going to cry when she was telling Abdic her past traumatic event.I did not like Anna at all, and even in the end I didn't like her. She's all about herself and Evie, of course, but I think she's very conniving and an ugly person. I recommend this book to anyone who loves Gillian Flynn's stories, as this really made me think of something she would have come up with. I hope we see more thrillers by Paula Hawkins!!"
87,Virginia Flowers,"OH MY GOD! This is the best book I've read in a while. I couldn't put it down, literally I stood by the kitchen counter reading the last bit.It has all of the somberness and unlikeable characters of a Gillian Flynn book, but you actually want to care about them. There are drunks, murderers, good samaritans, you just don't know which one is which. What happened to this person, did she run off? If so with whom? Did someone kill her...WHO? Is it a big joke, who is on whose side. You will tear through this book until you find out.The main narrator, Rachel, is one drink away from cirrhosis. She makes the worst decisions possible and all you can do is watch. It's like being trapped in a car going off a bridge. But you want to like her!"
88,David Jay,"Every few years I come upon a book that becomes the most wonderful time suck. I count the minutes until I can pick it up again, I miss my stop on the subway, my hour long commute feels like minutes. Welcome to ""The Girl on the Train!"" What starts as a potential chick lit storyline--overweight Rachel just can't let her ex-husband go and fantasizes about the lives of a beautiful couple she passes every morning on her commute--quickly turns into a wonderfully engrossing mystery when one of the main characters goes missing. There are multiple narrators, all unreliable, none wholly likable. I've heard people grouse that they were able to figure out the twists early on. This was not my experience but, even if it had been, the book was delectable. Read it when you have easily cancelled plans on the horizon!"
89,Samantha Gaines,BrilliantI loved it! Paula Hawkins created/crafted so many layers of speculation it was BRILLIANT. I hope it makes it to the big screen. If it does I will be there on opening day!
90,Mert,"düşününce konusunu pek de orijinal veya yaratıcı bulduğumu söyleyemem, ama karakterleri anlatışı ilgimi çeken ve dört okuyuşta bitirmemi sağlayan sürükleyiciliği veren şey oldu. kitabı klasik bir murder mystery'den ayıran şey de bu sanırım. olaydan ziyade karakterlerin arkaplanına odaklanması. ilginçtir ki kendi kendime sürekli ""abi kitapta olay olmayınca sıkılıyorum"" diyodum ama görünen o ki kitap zevkim hakkında hala bir kesinliğe varmış değil(miş)im.... ayrıca tüm kitabı nils frahm - says dinleyerek okudum ve biraz gone girl & gerilim havası aldığım bu müzik bayaa yakıştı bence.4.5/5"
91,Sara Kovach,"This book is absolutely NOT predictable. Those books are very rare - at least the ones I have chosen to read.I must say that at the beginning I was not sure I liked the book. It really started out slow. I had to push myself - thank goodness someone told me it had a slow start, or I might have hung it up early. However - once I got into it, I was addicted. There is definitely intrigue, drama, a huge mix of emotions to go around. I thought I had it figured out so many times - but I was so wrong!!!I really enjoyed the writing of this author. Although it was slow to start, after getting into it, I saw the point. I don't know that it could have been written in any other way. I liked the fact that the story was told in 3 different voices - this added to the story in so many ways. I want to thank those that recommended this book - I don't think I would have read it, but I am certainly glad that I did. I want to find others of the same type."
92,Meri,holy fucking mother jesus.
93,Gabby,"I have lost control over everything, even the places in my head.Thoughts upon finishing this book: Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit, what the fuck is wrong with people?"" and I mean that in the best way possible. This book is so intense and suspenseful and it honestly reminds me why thrillers are one of my favorite genres. It's so hard for me to believe that this book is Paula Hawkin's debut novel. It is absolutely outstanding. The ending gave me chills.This book is being compared to Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn and I do see a lot of similarities. I think this book was more quick-paced right from the very beginning, which I liked, but I loved both of these books equally. It had the same dark and gritty feel as Gone Girl, and it also shares the same idea of questioning what happened to this girl and who's to blame and where did she go? I absolutely love mysteries like this. We get to read from the perspectives of 3 females: Rachel, Anna, and Megan. Honestly, all three of these characters are completely fucked up and have a lot of issues, but that made it all the more fun to read. Our main protagonist Rachel is deeply depressed, she's also a pathological liar and a drunk alcoholic. It was interesting to read from her perspective because I never knew when she was telling the truth or when she was having her blacked-out version of the truth. The writing style of this book is on point, it is constantly suspenseful and there are several curve balls that I wasn't expecting (especially towards the end). I had theories throughout the entire book but I never got it right and I was so shocked while reading the final chapters of this book! I could not believe it. I thought I had a generally understanding of who all these characters are (or who they say they are) and then they turn around and do something crazy and unexpected and wow, you never really know who someone is behind closed doors. Even the nicest people can be completely insane. That's what I liked about this book is that every single character in this book was dark in their own way and had something to hide. I think that Rachel, Anna, and Megan were all messed up in their judgement at some point but it didn't make me like their characters any less. This book easily goes down as one of my favorite thrillers ever. Right up there with Gone Girl and Into The Darkest Corner. I love shit like this. I can't wait to see what other stuff this author puts out there. I'll read anything she writes. :)"
94,Tessa,"Loved this way more than Gone Girl. Same kind of story. Someone is missing, possibly dead. Who did it? You hear from some different voices, each one adding something a bit different to the story. I especially appreciated the way the story changed as the reader came around the bend of a curve of a new view. I couldn't stop reading."
95,Erika Robuck,"All the hype is well placed; this novel is fantastic. It moves with the unrelenting momentum of the train that carries the narrator past her old life and her new life, and Hawkins does a brilliant job of immersing us into the foggy confusion of an alcoholic. I tried to figure out what happened many times during the novel, but did not fully comprehend it until the truth was revealed. Gasps and shrieks from a morbidly marvelous ending make me encourage anyone who loves thriller/suspense to read it. Highly recommended! "
96,Theresa Bearegard,WOW!!!
97,Abi,"Excellent - very suspenseful with lots of unpredictable twists. This gets compared to Gone Girl a lot, and I'll say that the constant tension is similar, but the characters of Girl on the Train are infinitely more likeable and even sympathetic, which made it a much more enjoyable book for me. Highly recommended. I listened to the audiobook and the three narrators do an excellent job."
98,Sara,"I'm a picky reader. If it doesn't grab me right away, my mind will wander and I'll set it aside never to be picked up again.Not so with The Girl On the Train. I loved how each chapter is written as if from a diary entry, and how each chapter is a different character in the unfolding mystery. It really did keep me guessing until the end. So good!(This book is set to be made into a movie starring Rebecca Ferguson, Emily Blunt, & Jared Leto. I'm looking forward to see how they recreate the diary entries in the cinematic format.)"
99,Brian,"Rachel's life is falling apart. Alcoholic, overweight and still hopelessly in love with her ex-husband, she gets the same train into the city every morning even though she was fired from her job months ago and spends her days hanging around in parks and public libraries.Each morning the train stops at the same signal and Rachel stares at the back of the same house, occasionally getting a glimpse of the couple who live there. She fantasises about that couple, creating for them the dream life that she wanted for herself. Then one day she learns that the woman who lives in that house has been murdered and she realises that she has a vital piece of information about that woman, something she has glimpsed from the train that makes all the difference.The cleverly-structured narrative drip-feeds you just enough truth to enable you to navigate through the maze of confusion and misery that clouds Rachel's vision. Is she just a sad sensation-hungry drunk, looking for meaning in other people's lives because she has lost all hope of finding it in her own? The police certainly think so. To them she's just another one of those sorry individuals so fascinated by a violent crime that they cannot stay away. But what if she really does know something about the murder?A tightly-plotted character-driven thriller, compellingly narrated and full of twists and turns, The Girl On The Train draws you into the lives of a group of characters you may not want to know but cannot ignore."
100,Alma  Ramos-McDermott,"Rachel is unable to reconcile herself with her inability to have children and her subsequent divorce from Tom, the love of her life. No amount of constant pleading and whining will jar him away from Anne, the woman who is now the mother of his child. As a result of turning to drinking to ease her pain Rachel has turned into a lonely, uncontrollable drunkard, managing to get fired from her job.

101,Lori,"Unreliable narrators are all the rage right now, but this is the first one I've encountered who is unreliable because she drinks herself to blackout on a regular basis. Wow. This is the most deeply ashamed protagonist I've seen in a while. When I heard the premise, it reminded me of The Infatuations by Javier Marias, which is also a story of a bystander becoming enamored with the life of familiar strangers. In both, there's a murder and the bystander gets involved with the surviving spouse. But that's about the end of the similarities. Hawkins' novel is much more accessible because it prefers to be suspenseful rather than philosophical--about love, death, grief, shame, even alcoholism, for that matter.I admire this novel, especially as a debut, because Hawkins could have taken it a million directions, and it felt very much like she knew exactly which story she wanted to tell. She didn't get distracted trying to fix poor Rachel for us, or even to sober her up very directly, which would've been a colossal buzz-kill. As rehab tends to be. Rachel, Megan and Anna are all quite distinct in their sensibilities, both recognizable and complex. They don't like each other and there's no you-go-girl sentiments as an easy out. Babies are a problem in this novel--for everyone. Scott, Tom and even Kamal have their own particular shade of bullshit, yet Hawkins doesn't engage in the man-bashing the story tees up for us. That's for your book club, I guess.I think Hawkins has written a compelling story that should make us flinch, on so many levels. She doesn't give us anyone to ""like"" and she doesn't fix what's broken in her characters. Yet she does give us a satisfying ending and a good read."
102,Rebecca Taylor,"Loved it from start to finish!Wonderful, suspenseful, and completely unexpected. I enjoyed this book from start to finish and had a hard time putting it down."
103,Lyndsey Anton,LOVE LOVE LOVE this book. I would make sure you can read the last 50 pages or so in one sitting. You won't be able to put it down.
104,Liz,"www.lizliska.com “Hollowness: that I understand. I'm starting to believe that there isn't anything you can do to fix it. That's what I've taken from the therapy sessions: the holes in your life are permanent. You have to grow around them, like tree roots around concrete; you mold yourself through the gaps” -Paula Hawkins, The Girl on the TrainSo I just finished The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins, and all I can say is, read it now!If you liked Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn, then you will love The Girl on the Train. It has the same mystery, intrigue, and psychological twisted-ness as Gone Girl, but a little different.Rachel takes the commuter train to London everyday. The exact same commuter to and from London, morning and night. Everyday the train stops at the light by the same houses in a passing suburb on her commute. It is here that she gets her daily glimpse of Jess and Jason; a couple who live in one of the homes that she watches everyday. Jess and Jason have become a fantasy for Rachel—a perfect couple she idolizes until the day she sees something shocking that changes everything. The next morning she awakes from a terrible alcohol induced black out and everything is very, very wrong. The news broadcasts a shocking turn of events for Rachel's beloved Jess and Jason and her fleeting memories from the night before do nothing to help her believe she wasn't involved or witnessed something in someway.“There’s something comforting about the sight of strangers safe at home.” -Paula Hawkins, The Girl on the TrainI don't want to dive too deeply into the plot because there are so many good twists and turns and I do not want to give anything away, but I HIGHLY recommend reading this book. The main character Rachel is a serious train wreck. I do not mean this in a comedic or endearing sort of way; Rachel is a train wreck in a sad, pathetic, and horribly disturbed way. Emotionally damaged would be a polite euphemism to describe her -and she is absolutely fascinating to read about. I found myself (more than once) shouting at her in my head saying, ""Rachel! What are you thinking!"" She is a cringe worthy character, wonderfully flawed, raw, and so very real.“I am not the girl I used to be. I am no longer desirable, I’m off-putting in some way. It’s not just that I’ve put on weight, or that my face is puffy from the drinking and the lack of sleep; it’s as if people can see the damage written all over me, can see it in my face, the way I hold myself, the way I move.” -Paula Hawkins, The Girl on the TrainThis book was mysterious, interesting, creepy, and wonderfully written—I was hooked the whole way through."
105,Cuoricina,"Un capolavoro. Un ottimo thriller, coinvolgente e originale. Letto con avidità dalla prima all'ultima pagina."
106,Izzyreads,"Don't get me wrong. This book isn't perfect and has one or two loose ends that aren't completely tidied up. I say that first because I absolutely LOVED it. It had my heart racing and I couldn't put it down. ""What's he going to say now?"" I found myself asking as I raced to turn the pages. Three narrators, all unreliable and all absolutely believable. Fast pace, thrilling plot, plenty of twists. If you liked Gone Girl, you'll love this! My full review is on izzyreads.com"
107,Peter Dudgeon,"No spoilers in this review.Okay, here's a bold statement. This is one of the best books I have ever read. After gaining a degree in English language and literature, and publishing books myself - that's perhaps a strange statement to make. And, weirdly, I agree with all of the one star reviews too. The characters are not in the least bit likeable, the person 'who done it' stands out like a beetle on a white rug from an early stage, but these things, for me, are unimportant.I'm not interested in the ""oooh ... who could it be ...?"" dangling like string in front of a cat, for 400 pages, a handful of suspects, wanting me to attempt to spot the least likely person ... to put them in the frame ... that would be dull, dull, dull.What I am looking for is verisimilitude: that sense of reality, in the deftness of description, the desperate and genuine human frailty of the characters. I got all that and more.Okay, confession, I have travelled those lines into London now and again, and perhaps that has made me biased as to the realism, but, confession over, I have so many other things I love about this book.Weirdly motivated by pet hates, here is what I love: I loath over description - in every scene, the author picks out the 3, sometimes 4, occasionally 5 most important aspects of the scene and describes them in a fresh way: from ""boiling frogs in reverse"" (you may need to read Chris Argyris to get that one) to the silence ""stretching out, filling the space between us"", to ""the familiarity of walking upstairs and knowing which one is going to creek."" I could go on and on. Whereas most authors will trot out cliches of ""lump in throat"",""jolt of electricity"" etc etc, Hawkins pretty much avoids (okay, couple of instances at most) these throughout the book.Next point, dialogue. I HATE dialogue that relies on ""blah blah blah"" she replied, ""Meh Meh Meh,"" He contradicted, sarcastically"" - lazy, lazy, lazy and in SOOOO much fiction. Hawkins? None of this. I counted only one or two ""he said"", ""she saids."" And what that gives you is the author's voice not interfering with what's going on, you feel the scene, feel the characters and for this, Paula Hawkins, I applaud you.What else? The frailty of the human condition .... not many will like Rachel, many will pull their hair out at the things she does ... but anyone who's known pain and has ever developed a pattern of drinking, will taste the possibility of being Rachel and that's where the genius lies. You shouldn't relate to her character, but somehow you do. You want her to move on with her life, yet understand that she can't and for better or worse (probably worse) she won't. And I wanted so desperately to see where that led her.Very few books make me forget my surroundings, this one did.Ah yes, and pacing. You know those books where it takes four pages for someone to relay an unimportant experience and then the pivotal point happens in just one paragraph and you are left disorientated and out of reading rhythm .... none of that with this book, it's genuinely one of the most skilfully paced books I've read.And lastly ... dialogue realism. Have you every read those books where either each character talks in the same way - that's really just the author's voice - or they talk as ridiculous caricatures (""Officer Maloney, pass me another donut!"") well ... every word of dialogue in this book was believable and that's a MASSIVE achievement. Oh, I could go on, but who wants to read a thousand word review?A message to Paula Hawkins, don't be a Harper Lee: ""Write more books!!"" but don't rush them for a multi book deal, we'll gladly wait for another piece of brilliance."
108,Tamra,"Great easy read. Impossible to put down. I was hesitant to read it because, while I liked Gone Girl a lot, the ending still had me irritated (despite later realizing maybe that book actually needed to end like that). I think I liked this book more. It's faster-paced and more twisted. Truly a great psycho-thriller. "
109,Jordan,"I wasn't impressed with this book at first. I didn't care for Rachel and I thought it was just strange. However, I couldn't put it down and by the middle I was completely hooked. One of my favorites for sure!"
110,Carol N,"The “girl on the train” is Rachel, a daily commuter into London. Every morning she daydreams about the lives of the couples that she encounters through the train’s window. Rolling past the backyards of one happy couple, she names them Jess and Jason and fantasizes about their relationship . . . until that one day she see Jess kissing another man. The story is told from 3 perspectives, Rachel, divorced and unable to control her drinking, Megan, aka Jess, and Anna (Rachel’s ex, Tom’s new wife). Rachel has a history of drunken episodes that make it hard for her to determine fact or fiction. Like the train, the story is en route to a terrorizing and twisted ending. It sets into motion a chilling story that questions who can you trust? Be ready to be obsessed with this book, it is a book you won’t put down. "
111,Kat,"Call it 4.5 stars rounded up to 5, because I haaaate flashback epilogue endings; even though I understand why the author and editor made that choice, because of the last minute twist, I still feel like it could have been done a different way.This book is frequently compared to Gone Girl, but while they have similar plot elements (the disappearance of a beautiful woman), themes (impact of misogyny, the way media frenzy can distort the truth, unreliable perception of other people) and structural elements (multiple unreliable narrators), the impact to which these elements are put is very different. Gone Girl is a darkly indulgent thriller; much of the appeal of Amy is the element of power fantasy. When I want nothing so much as to scream at a guy for being an oblivious douchebag, but know that everything I have to say will be dismissed as my being too sensitive, Amy says, ""You know all of those stupid oblivious things that men do, and that according to sitcoms and society, women are just supposed to respond to with an exasperated sigh and then go clean up the mess? Actually, it's not OK. It was never OK. And now I'm going to use the comparatively few powers and privileges that I have as a woman, and fuck your shit up.""In contrast, The Girl on the Train is tragic and suspenseful. The internalized misogyny of the three narrators that keeps them from taking power over their own lives. The disrespect that they accept without question, or rather, by questioning themselves rather than the men who dole it out. That when they do start to question, to act like adults instead of children, to meet the men on equal ground, they are attacked. That Megan is murdered in the process of trying to be a better person, and Rachel very nearly so. That they were attacked by the same men. That they will never be able to commiserate. The only part of The Girl on the Train which could be called indulgent is the ending, and I really can't blame it for that -- by then, I was cheering with every blow that Rachel landed.There is a ton to unpack in both books, so much that I could easily write a book analyzing each separately, and then comparing them to each other. I am definitely getting a physical copy of this one, although the audiobook is truly excellent."
112,Monika,"Every character in this book is both awful and good in their own right. (Mostly) They're all nuanced and interesting.The base plot is a thriller told from a few different perspectives, and that on it's own is wonderful. That would be enough to make this a great novel. In addition, the author does a great job of not wrapping it up too quickly. She draws it out in a way that doesn't feel drawn out, so you slowly start to come to the correct conclusion yourself, but you always have a little doubt.What makes this book PHENOMENAL is the character study on three different perspectives of women involved in relationships, the examination of healthy and unhealthy activities in those relationships, and the ways in which we deal with those issues. The description of the feelings from the perspectives of two of the main characters was so compelling that I found myself almost crying in empathy. Hawkins has definitely been cheated on and at a minimum has the perspective of the woman who came along afterward. She really hit home on those emotions and some of the behaviors that go along with them.All alongside a thriller that keeps you guessing throughout the story. "
113,Kay,I'm so glad I bought this book! The writing style flowed so well and easily drew me into the story. It was so interesting how all the characters had their dark secrets. About 75% of the way through I developed a theory on the killer and BAM I was right. I couldn't stop turning the pages of this book. Very fast-paced and I recommend it !
114,Athena,"At the start I was quite unimpressed with this novel. It was depressing on more levels than I could initially contemplate, but as I continued reading I realized that whereas I am normally really good at discerning where a novel is headed... This one had me perplexed. I couldn't get a fix on what exactly the author was trying to lead me into, and I think that is what I liked most about this novel. Towards the end I began to put the pieces of the puzzle together, and with most novels that is about the time that I start to become bored; not in this instance. Instead, I kept turning the pages, because I was drawn into the how the end would unravel. I would recommend this novel to anyone that isn't afraid of the human condition, and all the depravities that humans are capable of. If you are overly judgmental, and hold yourself above all others I am sure you will not enjoy this rather exciting breakthrough novel from Paula Hawkins. "
115,BooksAndLipstick,this book was amazing made you really think! loved it!
116,Andrea Chirinos,"Ame extremadamente este libro.Una amiga que leyó el libro primero que yo me dijo que no estaba tan bueno y que recién se pone interesante las 100 últimas páginas de las 491 que son. Por lo tanto me bajo todas la expectativas pero cuando yo comenzó a leerlo me atrapo desde la primera página y no hubo ni una sola parte en la que el libro me aburriera.No espere ese final, pensé en todos los personajes para ver quién era el asesino pero nunca se me pasó por la cabeza que fuera ese personaje.Ahora los personajes Anna me cayó muy mal desde que la mencionaron, Megan no me cayó mal hasta que pasó lo que pasó a la mitad del libro, y por último Rachel, Rachel me cayó bien no la odie pero tampoco la ame."
117,Renee,"When I read Gone Girl, I was constantly waiting for the moment that everyone kept talking about -- ""the big twist."" With this book, I wasn't waiting. I was in a perpetual state of blissful suspense and even when I thought I might have an idea of what was going on, I was never completely confident. It was fun to read. It was easy to read. I sacrificed sleep and being on time to just about everything over the course of the week it took me to read this (very quick for me since I'm such a slow reader) to read this book. I loved that it was told from three different points of view -- the three women: Rachel, the main character, and then Anna and Megan, as well. The book centers on Rachel, a sad, middle-aged, alcoholic divorcee who won't stop following her ex-husband around. She takes the train every day, passing a house where she always sees a couple that seems to be perfect. She names them Jess and Jason and assumes she knows them. She assumes they're perfect and have it all. She makes up a whole life for them, never expecting that their worlds would come together. And then Jess -- really named Megan Hipwell -- goes missing, and Rachel knows that she had been in her town (following her ex-husband, Tom, around) that same night. But she'd been blackout drunk and doesn't remember anything. Or does she? Suddenly she finds herself trying to help Jason (Scott Hipwell) prove his innocence solely based on what she's seen from the train. The problem is that the police know she's an alcoholic and so does everyone else. They all dismiss her. Over the course of the book, Rachel battles herself and her own demons, but more and more is revealed about all three of their pasts and how their presents are all entwined. The end was not what I expected. It wasn't completely shocking, but it wasn't what I expected it to be. I was pleasantly surprised. She kept me on my toes like that. I had very few true criticisms of this book. After considering those that I did have for a bit, it occurred to me that they were done intentionally to throw the reader off (I can't say more without giving major plot points away). Some parts are intentionally left vague so as to not be so neatly packaged because real life wouldn't be that way. It was very enjoyable and I can't wait to see what else Paula Hawkins has in store! "
118,Marian,"A very subtle mystery. No gore, no heavy drama, no blood bath but a very spine chilling psychological mystery nonetheless. It's no surprise this won the year's Best Psychological Thriller award."
119,Anna Lee,"Alcoholic Rachel rides the train everyday into London and then back home,often with a cocktail or two. On this daily journey, Rachel encounters the neighborhood where she used to live, and as she peers inside she imagines the lives of the occupants. In particular, Rachel becomes enamored with a couple that she considers perfect- until sudden they aren't. With the disappearance of the wife from Rachel's idealized pairing, Rachel is suddenly drawn back into a world that she was pulled from and perhaps didn't want to leave. As Rachel gets drawn further and further in, secrets are revealed and pasts are uncovered. But can Rachel handle the truth? And can she figure it out before it's too late?Alternating between Rachel, the missing Megan, and Anna (current wife of Rachel's ex-husband), this book is what thrill-loving readers have been seeking. This gripping novel is what readers crave from suspense writers. Hawkins is an excellent writer who reveals just enough to keep the mystery alive until the the final pages. Bit by bit, as the enigma unravels, readers are left to grapple with the unreliability of memories and how we recognize who and what people truly are. Hawkins weaves a tale that is not to be missed. "
120,Jay Deb,"Ten stars. To say this book is excellent is an understatement. At the center there is Rachel, an alcoholic, unemployed, fat, divorced - total loser, continually harasses her ex-husband. She takes train rides and has an amnesia issue. One day she saw something odd but cannot remember exact details. Megan, a married woman, gets murdered. Rachel feels attraction toward Megan's husband. In part, because she saw Megan kissing another man. Rachel goes to the police and the story steam rolls. I was engrossed in the story and kept reading, not because I wanted to know who the killer was. I did not care about who the killer was. I was captivated by the quality of writing. I liked the main character, Rachel, not sure why. Maybe since she does not blame someone else for her misery?"
121,Marcelle Karp,"(borrowed, hardcopy, library)The Hitchcockian title, The Girl on the Train, by Paula Hawkins, tells you so little of what you need to know and yet everything; this book is a chock full of fuck. Told through the eyes of three women, Rachel, Anna and Megan, Hawkins takes you down on a winding path of pathos, unfulfilled lives, and the compromise of aging. The heart of the book is the extraordinarily unreliable narrator, Rachel, who is in her word, ""Not the girl I used to be."" She's lost that joi de vivre that propelled her through her 20's; now she's on the other side of 40, divorced, unemployed, and a drunk. Still, she's not without a need for structure; she takes the train to London everyday, as if she had a job, if only not to rouse suspicion from her flatmate Cathy. And on her train ride, everyday, she passes the small town she lived in with her now-ex-husband, Tom. Over the course of her illegitimate commute, she's become taken with a couple who lives across the train tracks, creating a whole fantasy life of who they are, and the love they share. Rachel revels in the seduction of a daydream as much as she indulges in her drink. The female of the fantasy couple is Megan, who goes missing (well, she's murdered). which sends Rachel on a Nancy Drew tailspin. And then there is Anna, who lives a few doors away from Megan, resents the sad sack ex-wife, even though it was Anna who was the other woman; Anna's whole world revolves around her perfect baby and her perfect husband and the perfect home they live in (even though, it was the same house Tom lived with Rachel in); I was white knuckling it as I tried to sort through Rachel's need to feel vital, Megan's need for adventure and Anna's need for the perfect life as Hawkins seamlessly thread their way in and around what really happened to Megan.Finished 2/18/15"
122,Juanita,Great book...!
123,Randy Gingrich,This was a tremendous mystery; the characters were captivating and the story was transformed. Anyone who has ever commuted on train will loves it for the simple premise that the story in part emerges from creating a story just about the people we see in passing on a commute; and who has not imagined what those people who we never really interact with might be like.
124,Syl  ʃʃ^.^ʃʃ,"One of the best psychological thrillers I read recently. I was wowed hroughout the book, except for a few pages in the middle when I started thinking, 'Oh, now I will have to give it 4 stars'. But then things began to warm up. I just fell in love with the English countryside background [Ashbury], Rachel, the 30 something jobless, alcoholic lady who is trying to redeem herself and failing at each attempt, but never giving up hope; Anna, who is chronically stressed out and insecure about her husband, infant daughter and everything else, and Megan, the deeply dysfunctional home maker, who is very unstable. The story is narrated as a POV of these 3 ladies. The male characters include Tom, the husband of Anna and also the ex-husband of Rachel, Scott, Megan's husband, and a red haired stranger, whose name I forgot. Cathy is Rachel's ever suffering housemate and hostess, who is the sometimes the stable backbone Rachel needs. I loved the various POVs, the various emotions, deceits and interactions. Loved the description of houses, places, train journey etc. If this book ever gets into this year's GR choice awards, I am gonna vote for it."
125,Kiley,I loved this book! It was a new breed of thriller that I enjoyed every page of. I think at first I expected something else but I loved the way the book developed and I would definitely recommend this. 
126,Allyson Kenna,this was a good book. it took me a little bit to get into it but once I did I liked it!
127,Gabriela Medvetska,"I closed my curtains, curled in bed and was swallowed by the story. English language gives some kind of magic features to the books I read.I gave it 5 stars even though the plot is pretty simple and predictable.I gave it 5 stars even though heroes are messed up and very depressing.I gave it 5 starts even though there are some other weak points.However, I don't understand when people start to abuse each other and blame in not being a ""good reader,"" spoiling Goodreads books' ratings. Everything is related and nobody is forcing anybody to read what all people read. Everybody knows that a mainstream stuff is usually not the best quality. Why do you need to read it and then educate others about it?Let here rest an additional 5 star rating.I gave it 5 stars because the scene takes place on the outskirts of London. It has always been a place of mystery for me from all of the books I read about it before.I gave it 5 stars because it is written from 3 different women's perspectives. It helpes to imagine places and events better: as if you are watching a movie and camera circles around, going from one person to another.I gave it 5 starts because each of us can relate to any of the characters. We are not professional critics and or literature reviewers. We are common people who do not need much to get something from the book. It has to be realistic and based on our true feelings and emotions.You know how it is when you idealize your partners/friends and after you break up you're finally able to see all of the weak and negative points of their personalities.You know how it is when you lie somebody to look better in their eyes, but eventually you are stuck in the mud you created and you cannot get rid of it.You know how it is to sneak on somebody and be able to find evidence of their betrayals.You know how it is to feel sick when you're drunk and not be able to finish with it even if it makes you feel bad.You know how it is when you made a wrong step and you cannot stop all of the outcomes.You know how it is when you cannot trust anybody.The story is connected with our lives in all dimension.Why should only high masterpieces, elevating and educational stories get credit?Why the book about our every day life, written in a simple manner (trust-issues, madness, depression, arguments, treachery, etc) cannot be a masterpiece?It made me think a lot and I am sure that it is the main goal any book has to accomplish."
128,Jeanette,"Rachel Watson rides the train every day to her non-existent job outside London. Recently divorced (her husband cheated) depressed, and an alcoholic, she continues this ruse so her landlady won't know she was fired from her job. Rachel's husband is now married to his mistress, Anna, and they have a baby, adding to Rachel's misery. Each day the train passes her former home, as well as the home of an apparently loving couple whom Rachel has assigned fictional names. When Rachel sees something from the train window that shocks her, and when later the female she has observed goes missing, Rachel decides to go the police. Unfortunately Rachel is not considered a reliable witness. The story unfolds in the voices of Rachel, Anna, and Megan (the missing lady), and as the suspense builds, nothing is as it seems. This is a real page turner, well written and plotted. The ending was surprising but satisfying."
129,Cynthia Fink,"A good page-turner, a good story. I'd picked it up months ago and in the beginning I couldn't get into it. Because all my friends were raving about the book and I knew the movie was coming out, I decided to give it another go and I'm very glad that I did. The author fleshes out every character so you feel as though you know them. You don't of course, and therein lies the tale that entices you to keep reading until you get to the end.The last few chapters will leave you breathless. I just finished it. I don't write many reviews, although I read a lot of books, it's 1:20 am and I hope I can fall asleep tonight. After the very satisfying ending, I know this book will stay with me a long time. "

One for sorrow, two for joy, three for a girl, four for a boy, five for silver, six for gold, seven for a secret never to be told.
Let me just say that this has been a very.... ummm, crappy and enlightening birthday. So the highlight of my day was finishing this book! I don't read many adult crime type novels. They have to be some kind of strange, weird, out of the ordinary, psychological thriller, fucked up, type of thing for me to read them. So when people associated this with Gone Girl, I was immediately intrigued, because I love that book. So of course I had to give it a shot.I loved this book. I love how absolutely terrible everyone is (each in their won way) and no one is entirely likable (though some you just feel sorry for). Its gritty, sleazy, fast paced, gruesome at times, sad, and just totally crazy. One thing that really pulled me in at the beginning was being in Rachael and Megan's heads. It reminded me slightly at times, of being in Esther's head in The Bell Jar. They are just messed up, in different ways of course, but it felt familiar. Then the author referenced Sylvia Plaths life and blew my mind. 
I think about Ted Hughes, moving Assia Wevill into the home he'd shared with Plath, of her wearing Sylvia's clothes, brushing her hair with the same brush. I want to ring Anna up and remind her that Assia ended up with her head in the oven, just like Sylvia did.
Literally all of the relevant people in this book have issues. I felt the most bad for Rachael, and she tried so hard to be good. I even liked Megan, for a minute. Anna, good grief she is on my list of top most hated characters. SO full of herself. Such a bitch. Then men, well.... ugh. I also love the way the story played out, starting at different times, and then lining up in the end. I like the different POV's too, it really helped the story! I remember the exact moment I had a guess as to the bad guy, (view spoiler)[when Megan said she saw a cars headlights, and he smiled at her. I immediately thought Tom. lol (hide spoiler)] and I ended up right, but that didn't change that I loved the story and how we got there. 
I don't know. I don't know where my strength went, I don't remember losing it. I think that over time it got chipped away, bit by bit, by life, by the living of it.
There is sad, depressing, sleazy, messed up stuff going on here, and it made for one hell of a book. I think I definitely loved this more than Gone Girl, and I have to say I don't exactly entirely see why the comparison is there anyway. To me, they are very different. I like to believe that if Sylvia Plath wrote a psychological thriller, it would be like this. That is a huge compliment to the author! I cant wait to read more by her! I definitely recommend this one!! "
131,Ali,"A mystery so thrilling, it will leave your head spinning! Rachel has lost it all: her husband, her job, her hopes of children, and maybe even her sanity. In order to avoid conflicts with her flatmate, she continues to take the morning train into London to ""go to work"". It is on this regular commute that Rachel gets to know Jess and Justin.It isn't until a particularly hungover morning that Rachel realizes things are getting worse for her. She blacked out again last night and can't quite remember why her clothes were dirty or how she had gotten the cut on her head. Then she realizes that Megan (Jess) is missing. And there are so many similarities between Megan's disappearance and the flashes of nightmare/memory that Rachel is experiencing. Is there something Rachel is missing, just out of the grasp of her memory? Is there something she should be apologizing for...or worse, going to the police about?The twists and turns of this plot will be leaving you dizzy and second guessing your every prediction!"
132,Liliana,"I'm still shaking! 1000 stars! The final... was an explosion in my head, everything happened faster and faster!!!"
133,Inger Brecknell,"If you are looking for a great contemporary mystery, this is it! Thoroughly enjoyed this! Score: 9/10."
134,Jules (Never enough time to read),"If you haven't read it...read it now!I can't say much about the story for fear of giving away any spoilers, but I was hooked from start to finish. It was a tense, often heartbreaking and emotional read. Definitely one of the best audio books I've listened to in a while, all the narrators did a perfect job of bringing something extra to a great story."
135,Marjorie Brody,Fast reading. Well done. Often would have to check on the dates of when things happened. But loved the writing and character development. Would definitely read more from his author. Recommend reading.
136,Irene,Just as twisty and unexpected as Gone Girl.
137,Ebony,"Well, well, well. What a book! The writing style wasn't perfect and there were a few mistakes here and there but what a story! This is my first ever review on a book so that just goes to show how brilliant I thought it was. This storyline had me hooked from the very beginning and had me thinking 24/7 about the possibilities with the characters. 'Who did this? Who did that? Why would he/she do that?' Were questions I often asked myself. While this book may have had some issues with the writing style, it was easy to forget once the storyline kicked into gear. This book, for me, definitely deserves the 5/5 I gave it. I have recommended it to my friends and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a new read. (It's all most midnight for me but I hope this all makes sense to you guys) "
138,Radhika,"Was on my list, and by sheer luck, a friend loaned me a copy and I read half of it on a flight out to the other coast and then finished it on the red eye back. Needless to say, the book's narrative and the story had my interest going, and I read it on the kindle, so that also adds to the fact that it was gripping! The narration, the characters and the storyline, the way it zigged and zagged between perspectives and views of some times the same scenarios. One feels empathy, sympathy and helplessness for each of the characters as they are dragged through the single day's nightmarish ordeal, and how each are sucked into it! A great narrative that is not your usual, and despite a fairly ogical and straightforwrd ending, says a lot about the writer to eb able to keep the interest. Highly recommend. "
139,Faye,gahhhh this book was absolutely amazing!!!
140,Barbara Patrick,"Best, most entertaining book I've read in a few years!"
141,Gabriela,"I enjoyed every single page of this book; in my opinion the story is outstanding! And hey, this is the author´s first thriller, I think she did a great job and can´t wait to read her next book.What can I say about Rachel (the main character and one of the narrators of the book)? Well, I hated her throughout the story but I couldn´t stop reading what she had to say. She´s so spontaneous, so stupid, so stubborn, but so human. Her speciality is getting into trouble and this was the thing I both, hated and liked about her at the same time! What about the rest of the characters?  Well developed by the author and –oh my god- I wouldn´t like to have their lives!A must read if you like thrillers, female narrators and stupid ( in kind of a silly but a good way – you´ll understand this when you read the book)  main character!"
142,Sean Farrell,"2015 has only just begun, and already we may have one of the year's best suspense novels on our hands. This book follows Rachel, an alcoholic who has developed a fantasy life in her head for an attractive couple she sees in their home from her commuter train every day. When the wife of said couple goes missing, she can't help but involve herself in the mystery, which rather unsurprisingly winds up further complicating her life. The story moves back and forth in time, and is told from the perspectives of Rachel, her ex-husband's new wife Anna, and the missing woman Megan (who Rachel initially refers to as Jess in her fantasy). No one in the story seems to be trustworthy, as they all hide information and/or outright lie to each other in order to achieve their goals, which makes getting to the bottom of things that much more challenging for everyone, including the reader. Despite all the characters being heavily flawed, most of them come across sympathetically, which helps one actually care about their fates. Rachel in particular is well fleshed out, and comes the closest to being outright likable, which is quite a feat considering how unbalanced she is. The plot moves along at a very brisk pace and builds up to such a suspenseful conclusion that it is a hard book to put down. It may be a little dark for some people's tastes, but I found it to be one of the most entertaining books I've read in a long time."
143,Clarissa Lim,"I told myself I'd review every book I read this year.. so here goes me.I really enjoyed this. It was a very smooth read from start to finish, and at no point did I find myself frustrated or bored, the way I usually inevitably feel when reading almost any book, which is odd, since none of the characters in the book were very likeable to begin with. (view spoiler)[(Except, funnily enough, Tom. I remember thinking to myself near the start, after almost all of the characters have been introduced, that Tom's the only character who seems remotely likeable. Which, i suppose, is a testament to the quality of writing - I was convinced he was a good guy, I even came to see him as a victim, pushed into adultery by his drunk hot mess of a wife. Hah! Kudos, Paula Hawkins. (hide spoiler)]. Usually when this happens I tend to lose interest since there is no one to root for when you pretty much dislike everyone, but The Girl on the Train was so well paced and gripping that the plot took over, overshadowed the flaws of the characters, and it didn't really matter that I didn't like these people, I just wanted to know, with the same burning curiosity that Rachel had, what exactly had happened. I did figure it out just before the book confirmed it, but by no means was this novel predictable. In fact, before I put the pieces together I never knew what was going to happen on the next page flip or chapter, and I was happy enough to let the book take me on the ride. It was only past a certain point where all of the pieces had been presented that it finally clicked together for me. I had put the book down to hop in the shower, and aren't showers just great places to have striking realisations midway through a compelling read? It was a gleeful journey to the end of the book after that as I checked if I had got it right. I did feel sorry for Rachel a few times in the book, but mostly I was irritated and convinced that she was unstable and crazy. I felt nothing for Megan and I absolutely hated Anna. They were all fantastically portrayed. Convincing. I admit I had to go back and forth a few times to check the dates (and MAN is that a bitch to do on a kindle), but that's mostly because I didn't pay enough attention to the dates in the first place - I have a bit of ADHD, but I don't imagine it'd really be that hard to keep up with. I can see the similarity to Gone Girl, and why people would compare this to that, but I frankly did not enjoy Gone Girl that much. The Girl on the Train was a much, much more enjoyable read. The pacing of the book is what stood out to me. 336 pages was the perfect length. Gone Girl's 560 pages had me feeling almost physically exhausted by the end, tired of the batshit crazy of it all. But this, this was fun. I didn't want to put it down after I really got into the swing of it, determined to finish it even as my eyes were closing and dawn was approaching. Eventually I had to admit defeat but the second I woke up I was reading again. A gripping and fantastic read. Pick it up. Enjoy the ride. "
144,Jules,"This is a psychological thriller, which interweaves the POVs of three women -- Rachel, Megan, and Anna -- into an evolving murder mystery. I understand the comparisons to Gone Girl, but Girl on the Train has a more ambitious structure. It's populist, sure, but I've read a lot of ""best-sellers"" that were nowhere near as enjoyable and readable as this. I would give it very high marks. If I could offer any negative criticisms, I might say that I wish there was more about Anna, more POV from other characters like the police, Rachel's flat-mate, and the red-haired man, and that there were a few more likable characters added, to offset the darkness. But I was undeniably drawn to Rachel; I could relate to her so well that I found myself forgiving her faults, and rooting for her to, somehow, win. I was in tears by page three! And adding more might spoil the structure, which is very well-crafted. I look forward to much more from this author."
145,Davina Gadkar ,"This book. Ohmygod! I literally could not put down! I thought it would take me 4 days to read. I finished it in 1 1/2. It was that good! Gripping, tragic, and emotional, this book was a bomb (in the good way)! I have low expectations for new adult novels, because let's be real: YA for the win! But seriously, this surprised and boggled me. I went in thinking it would be a contemporary novel, but it was so much more. It's mystery, horror, terror, and more wrapped into one book. I just loved the writing style and story line. I mean, I get why everyone was saying bad stuff about the book. Like yeah, there were no 'good' characters. They were all hot messes. But I think that just makes the story better! Like what other book have you read with so many strong, negative characters? It was a new type of story, filled with antagonists!! I think the best thing I liked about this book was the surprises. It starts off from the perspectives of two girls. And then three. The perspectives talk about their lives. They all live depressing lives. There's nothing in common with these girls except for the fact that they live sad lives and have been hurt in some way. They are all mentally unstable depressed people. We keep reading and we start to enjoy the book. But then you start to think : HOW is it related? Because it's hard to join these stories! But then BAM! The author connects all these stories and we realize that they aren't 3 stories, it's one story told from different sides! I loved how the author took a small thing like what she sees on the train, and somehow connected it all! Like Jess and Jason were Megan and Scott! I never saw that coming! And Todd was cheating AGAIN! And Megan killed her child! And Scott was violent too! Like lets just say- this book is INTENSE! My god, there were so many twists and turns! It was a dark, dark, dark & gloomy book. But I loved it (and I don't even like mysteries). Don't try to solve the mystery as you read because you will never solve it! It was like BOOM BOOM BOOM. I'm breathless after reading this! Nobody in this story is how they seem! Except Evie. But I have a feeling she'll grow up traumatized although she won't remember what happened. "
146,Sadie Walton,Truly a mystery from beginning to end- I didn't know how it was going to go... Great read!
147,Rebecca Odell,"This book DEFINITELY lived up to what everyone said. It was so good. If you liked Gone Girl, this book has as many twists and turns. AHHH SOO GOOD."
148,Linda  Branham Greenwell,"Tt's a British mysteryAt first I didn;t think I really liked the story. I got bogged down with not liking the main character and her drinking and feeling sorry for herselfRachel is divorced from Tom. Tom had an affair with Anna and is now married to Anna and they have a baby - and they all live happily in the house where Rachel used to live. Rachel drinks every day, gets really drunk every day, and calls Tom all of the time. She has lost her job, but she rides the train every day to London so that her roommate believes she still has a job. The train takes her past her old house.As she passes by the house - she looks at her old neighborhood. She sees a couple who live a few doors down from her old house. She makes up about them. A loving couple, madly in love. Then one day she sees the wife kissing another man...and then the wife goes missing. She becomes obsessed with telling the husband what she saw from the train. She was in the village that night, really drunk - and in a blackout - but she has pieces of a memory....A really good story"
149,Nora Black,"An intricately crafted glimpse of a character tethered loosely to life, a world shattered and skewed by odds normally conceived as surmountable, an everyday-type tragedy that ordinary people face and overcome daily, but 'The Girl On The Train' cannot, she cannot rise above the ache of her divorce, she cannot find courage, she cannot move on. This portrait of suffering is so richly developed in this tale, so poignantly embroidered that the raw pain of rejection etches the pages as if scalded by a hot needle drawn across tender skin. The protagonist is not even likable, but she is, nevertheless, irresistible because the author so cleverly yanks pieces of every reader and tosses them into the traits of this anti-heroine until she becomes utterly personal, we've all felt her angst, if not as keenly. Rachel is an ugly drunk, she sneaks canned gin-and-tonic onto the morning train, she abuses her best friend's hospitality and she is winding herself into the knot of homeless-vagrant at speed. She fumbles, falls and creates chaos wherever she goes, she also lives in a uniquely conjured imaginary world:- she devises a fantasy existence for a couple she often spies from the solitary window of her commuter train compartment. She names the couple, emotes unrealistic affection at them, and believes they fit her ideal of what love is meant to be. Cunningly, this couple lives only doors away from her ex and his new lady-love and cherub toddler. Ah what a setting, so filled with the possibility of destructive force. Yes, force, an entire vortex of swirling mayhem sprinkled to glitter the scene and tantalize the reader.The author not only masters the sense of intrigue brilliantly, but she peppers it with eloquent descriptions of location, environment and the protagonist's state of mind. This aspect is so subtly handled that the scene is lodged in the reader's mind as if by magic, the reader is pulled into the story with all senses tingling: aroma, hue, shade and drama are brushed in at ever layer. This is an accomplished dramatist, and the thrill of the technique will keep the reader flipping the pages well into the night.The story rotates around a sighting Rachel makes of her dream girl that shocks her and pushes her into the reality of her make-believe couple, she has information that could solve a crime, and suddenly she acquires a personality, she starts to shape up and 'fix' herself. This is the true fulcrum of the tale, the turning point that puts the reader on Rachel's side, prompts the reader to 'root' for her and 'like' her.Ultimately the thriller aspect, for me at least, takes a backseat to the character development and the emotional see-saw ride created by the shifting emotions in the story, the whodunit aspect becomes less important, there is a whole book to read rather than only a climax to tie up the story. I enjoyed reading it immensely even if I imagined it would end differently. "
150,Rubina,"This is one of the best murder mysteries I've read. The comparisons to Gone Girl were accurate. I've been trying to find more suspenseful, well crafted books like this one with several female viewpoints."
151,Leonie,"This is quite a hard book to review for one reason only. It's comparison to Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl. Put simply it is nothing like it really. Gone Girl is to this day one of the creepiest books I ever read, surpassed only by One of Flynn's other novels Sharp Objects. Nobody can write like Flynn for her levels of creepiness and thrilling writing. But did it make this boom bad because it wasn't Gone Girl? No. It was still a great book, still an interesting read with a very impressive amount of red herrings thrown in that kept me guessing until very near the end. I still enjoyed it very much I would still recommend it to other thriller and crime fans it is still a very impressive novel and deserves its 5* rating, the ending could be described as flat but it is sort of what you come to expect as a thrillers ending not many of them end up in a way that surprises you. I think that it has been unfortunate that this book has been associated with Gone Girl simply for the reason that it made its readers expect far more of it than what it is and lost it the praise it deserved as a novel in its own right. "
152,Alison Dickerhoof,"What a thrilling read! It takes quite the page-turner to get me to finish a novel in one day. Paula Hawkins was quite clever in her crafting of the the main character females. The three of them encompass so many character flaws that I think it would be next to impossible for any woman not to relate to them in some way. I know I certainly identified with many of their flaws. And, when I relate to the characters I enjoy the story much more completely.I agree with other reviewers that the end of the book seemed a little bit forced. The plot starts out actually quite believable, and ends up spiraling into quite an unbelievable tale by the end of the book. But, that's what makes this a thrilling read and not boring, realistic drivel.If you haven't yet, read it!"
153,Hannah Polley,A really gripping thriller told from the perspective of three women. One of the woman is murdered and it's about trying to figure out who did it. I didn't guess until the reveal and thought it was a really good ending. The story is told almost like diary entries but it's trying to mimic the train commute so you get the story in 'morning' and 'evening' sections. I did struggle to get in to the very first part of the book but after 30 pages or so I was hooked!
154,Kelsey," Let me just preface this by saying that this book really is nothing like Gone Girl. I, for one, found Gone Girl to move way too slowly and couldn't bring myself to finish it.  Yes, The Girl on the Train may have progressed slowly towards the beginning, but I feel that enough was revealed to make you want to keep reading. Another thing that keeps getting brought up is that none of the characters are likeable, but I think that's what makes it so captivating. The moment you begin to think you have it all figured out, something crazy happens and you're back at square one. I honestly didn't put the pieces together until the last few pages/ chapters and that's exactly how it should be. "
155,Daniel Keohane,"Very clever novel, switching perspectives between three women whose lives are intertwined and who are very similar, though they do not know it. Beginning from the perspective of Rachel who watches two homes along the tracks while commuting to London, like a voyeur, the novel speeds through flashbacks of the prior day after whatever events have occurred. It's all an interesting way to tell a story, and keeps you moving forward. The writing is amazing, hats off to Hawkins for consistently smooth, clean prose, which always moves and never feels stale or repetitive. "
156,Melody Bearskin,A great read for those that love a thrilling unexpected ending while keeping you on the edge wanting more! 
157,Julia  Yeates,"This is one of those books that consumes your weekend and, when you raise your head from the final page, leaves you a little breathless and dazed. I loved it.I loved the way Paula Hawkins gets under the skin of her female characters, how she knows what is is to be the sad alcoholic, the scheming second wife, the broken girl. Because that's what writing is all about, isn't it? The voyeuristic glimpses into the lives of other people and trying to understand what makes them behave as they do? And the 'there but for the grace of God' ... "
158,Dora,Do damn good!!
159,Helen,"I am giving this 5 stars because as a first book, it is remarkable. Even if this weren't her first book, it would be remarkable. Hawkins crafted this book with three narrators, the present and the past and veiled identities so well, I didn't guess the culprit till the very end. She even made me dislike the protagonist. I wanted to just feel sorry for her, but she was so pathetic my sympathy turned to loathing. I could not put this book down. An outstanding thriller. I highly recommend it."
160,Kandice,"I really, really enjoyed this book! It took me a bit to get the hang of the different POVs, most especially because the dates were not linear. I had to keep flipping back and forth to be certain where in the narrative I was. That's not a complaint. I'm fine with a novel that requires a bit of effort on my part.I know this has been compared to Gone Girl, and as much as I hate to jump on the bandwagon, I have to agree. Hawkins keeps you guessing. In the beginning you are lost, but really, each time you think you've figured out where you are...you're wrong! I'd like to think I cottoned to Tom's lies soon, but I'll never know for sure unless I compare the page I figured that out with another reader.I feel the end was a mild disappointment. Not enough to delete any stars, obviously, but I think she could have done a bit better. I will be watching for her other books. I don't even know if this is her first, but I'll be checking as soon as I finish this and if it isn't, I'll be scooping them up."
161,Kimaya Mathew,"Ooh my god!!!That is my only reaction after reading this thrilling read. I started it yesterday, and finished it today. This is clear enough to show all you readers out there that this is one book you do not want to miss out.Rachel kept me grilled enough and my adrenaline coursed through my veins. I hated, hated Anna for what she was and felt like killing Tom, for the big jerk and asshole he is portrait as.Megan though, is one complex character which shows how psyche of women, and by that I mean, the modern day working women works as. We are exposed to so many things around us that it is hard to comprehend with both the genders choices these days...No spoiler here, though!!Please, do not stop in the mid even if a book does not interest you or is not your cup of tea.Respect the authors hard work.Oone commendable piece of fiction by Paula Hawkins.Kudos to you mam"
162,Adrienne Herndon,"Although it took a minute to get used to the alternating chapters, the author had me hooked from the beginning. The number of twists and turns through the plot were written in an extremely engaging manner. This is the type of book that is hard to put down."
163,Steph,"Hawkins creates a gripping who-dunnit novel that is dripping in sneaky clues hidden beneath the surface of the text. The multiple narrations give the reader a history into the faults of the three main females, Rachel, Anna and Megan. For anyone that has been betrayed by an ex-lover, Rachel is the perfect embodiment of everything wrong about bad break-ups. She is an alcoholic who stalks her ex-husband, whilst doing this she witnesses mysterious events taking place on her old street that she passes every day, but as such an unreliable narrator with black outs in place where there should be memories, can she really be trusted? Hawkins creates such wonderful back stories for these characters that you really begin to feel like you know them. She makes you feel happy for one character at the start of the novel and then hate them towards the middle. Hawkins has created a masterpiece of a crime thriller, the ending could have reached out and slapped me in the face it was that unexpected. If you want to have sleepless nights, then read The Girl on the Train! "
164,Melissa Cecchini,"I would actually give this 4.5 stars but of course I can't! This was such an engrossing and riveting book. It had me intrigued until the very end. It was so hard to put down! I don't know what it is but I am always interested in books about trains. I think I can blame ""Murder on the Orient Express"" for that and this book did not disappoint. And it had such a creepy edge to it, but not in an awkward off - putting way. I could say this book as a definite movie, it was such a good thriller. Unfortunately, the only person who could truly bring it to the big screen and give it its proper justice, would be Alfred Hitchcock. This book just wreaks of Hitchcock."
165,Lars Poulsen,"Litteraturpolitiet burde have grebet ind og hindret udgivelsen af Paula Hawkins ""Kvinden i toget"". En debut som denne, vil i lang tid fremover få alle andre debutromaner til at blegne langt ud over det rimelige.Jeg kan ikke mindes hvornår jeg sidst har læst en bog der dels var så spændende, og dels så vanvittigt velskrevet som denne. Jeg kan slet ikke få armene ned igen, og har måttet klæbe tastaturet fast i loftet for at skrive denne anmeldelse.Rachel tager hver morgen toget fra en londonforstad ind til London, og hver aften tager hun toget hjem igen. Det er flere måneder siden hun har mistet sit job på grund af druk, men hun skammer sig ved at fortælle det til veninden som hun er flyttet ind hos efter at hendes ægteskab også røg sig en tur. Hver dag kører toget forbi det hus hun boede i sammen med sin mand Tom. Rachel følger med i livet hos et par der bor i samme gade, men et par huse længere nede. Hun får korte glimt hver dag når toget standser ved et defekt stopsignal, og hun fantaserer i alkoholtågerne om deres lykkelige liv. Men en dag ser hun noget, der kommer til at vende op og ned på hendes liv - og på adskillige andres. Problemet er bare, om hun kan stole på det hun ser, og om andre kan stole på hende. Om det er virkeligt, eller om det er hendes tågede hjerne der fortæller hende ting.Udover at skrive utroligt godt, har Paula Hawkins også formået at grave dybt ned i den menneskelige psyke, og beskrive hvad hun ser. Bogens karakterer udvikler sig for øjnene af læseren, og vi bliver stille og roligt vidne til menneskers forfald. Der sker ting og sager undervejs, og det er et spørgsmål om hvem der gjorde hvad og hvornår, ligesom i alle andre spændingsromaner. Det nye er, at disse spørgsmål bliver besvaret på et eller andet teknisk plan - han gjorde det og det, sådan og sådan. Men da sidste side var vendt, vidste jeg hvem - og så alligevel. For hvem er vi, og hvordan påvirker vi hinanden og vore respektive liv? Hvem er skyldig - og er der nogen uskyldige?Er man til tju-bang, masser af vold og blod, udpenslede sexscener og ensomme whiskypåvirkede politimænd, skal man gå langt udenom ""Kvinden i toget"". Den har ingen af delene. Til gengæld når den helt derind, hvor det bliver rigtig uhyggeligt. Der hvor virkeligheden lurer lige om hjørnet, og man bliver nødt til at trænge ned i sig selv. Det er så vildt.En fantastisk debut, og der er ikke noget at sige til at DreamWorks sikrede sig filmrettighederne allerede inden bogen udkom, eller at den indtil videre er udgivet i 44 lande. P.t. (oktober 2015) skriver Hawkins på en ny thriller. Det kan kun gå galt. Med ""Kvinden i toget"" har hun sat barren så højt, at det bliver næsten umuligt ikke at slå hovedet imod den næste gang.Men jeg er helt sikkert klar når hendes næste værk udkommer."
166,Julieanne,"A gripping and fresh novel that had me on the edge of my seat for over four hours. It was brilliant, edgy, touched on real subjects and with the main character, Rachel, I couldn't help but root for her. Fantastically written in a style I've come to love and with the alternating POV's, I was entertained. And when the twist was delivered, I shouted out, ""I bloody knew it,"" even though I didn't want to believe it. Overall a tremendous job and I can't wait to read more from Paula Hawkins. "
167,Elizabeth Howard,One of the best books I've read in a long time! If you enjoyed Gone Girl you'll love it more.
168,Jessie,Yup. A must-read-keep-you-up-too-late kinda book
169,Kymberly,"Outstanding Read!!!I was personally recommended this book by a coworker and man am I glad that she recommended it! It is an amazing tale told from three different women's points of view. Rachel-a battered, alcoholic who was left by her husband for another takes the train everyday and imagines made up lives of people who live on the stops of the train. Megan-who suffers from guilt, anxiety and loss who tries to mask her pain in things she shouldn't. And Anna-a wife and mother who is trying to deal with her husband's ex all the while trying to be the perfect mother and beautiful wife. Their stories intertwine and lead up to a Saturday night when a great mystery happens. Filled with suspense, mystery, death and what real life throws at us ""The Girl on the Train"" is an excellent novel!!! "
170,Margie Van Evera,"Couldn't put this down! Stayed up till 1:00am to finish it. It was good, sad, and weird all at the same time. I felt like the characters were true-to-life ... Pathetic, confident, sad, confused, desperate ... all of those characteristics and more."
171,Liza Palmer,"THIS BOOK IS SO GOOD. What Hawkins does with the role of a narrator - and how she plays with that - is phenomenal. Are they credible? Are they telling the truth about themselves? And then how she spins that around to hit us with... how credible are we as the narrators of our own stories and how much do we lie or bend the truth to serve our own narrative. Love how she weaponizes shame. How she really delves into taking responsibility for things and how powerful it is to make someone see the truth of themselves. Oh, it's so good. (This reminded me of Happy Valley. If you like this? WATCH THAT... and everything Sally Wainwright does...) "
172,Marji,"I'm giving this 5 stars because it's so well written, the characters are well drawn, and the mystery is well concealed. Because of the comparisons with Gone Girl I was tempted to think Megan wasn't dead, that is until they unearthed the body. Then with every twist and turn I questioned my guesses on who did it. I didn't rate it 5 stars because I liked the characters, in fact there wasn't really a likable character in the book. The author clearly views humans as seriously flawed individuals. The girl on the train being one of the most seriously flawed. I wanted to shake her. "
173,Jenny Mandeville,Awesome book! A terrific thriller that will keep you intrigued until the very end. I hope this author writes more great books like this! 
174,C.L. Taylor,"What a riveting read! I sped through it, utterly engrossed. I did guess who did it very early on but that didn't spoil my enjoyment in the least. It was so brilliantly twisty and Rachel was a fascinating character. The ending was hugely satisfying. This is a book that lives up to the hype that surrounds it. Highly recommended."
175,Miranda,"I picked this book up at my local chapters, because it was the store's book club choice for the month and I decided I wanted to be a little more social this year. They sent me a quick bio of the book in my email and it sounded quite interesting. I was not disappointed. This book features Rachel who is a completely unreliable narrator having recently recently becoming separated from her husband and falling into alcoholism. Every day she looks out of the train at one couple on their patio. She imagines what they are like believing them to be the perfect couple. One day she sees something out the window that is startling and the next day the woman goes missing. Inserting herself into the investigation everything and everyone is suspect through the eyes of this unreliable narrator...including herself. It is extremely disconcerting not being able to trust the person who is walking you through a novel. The story is also told through the eyes of two other women neither of who are likeable. Despite none of the characters being loveable the story manages to bring the point home that nobody is perfect or what they may seem. The novel makes several poignant points about the fact that what may seem to be perfect from the outside may actually be anything but.The novel also explores what it is to have struggles in your life and how you might overcome them. Rachel is a broken woman who is trying to make sense of a situation that is not what she would have wanted for herself.""It comes from shared experience, from knowing how it feels to be broken."" and ""the holes in your life are permanent. You have to grow around them""With plenty of plot twists and a great deal of tension this novel is a page turner. I recommend this to anyone who likes a good thriller or mystery."
176,retronoisette,"Really enjoyed this. Proper mystery with a dash of drama. I'm a sucker for unreliable narrators and a cast of characters so awful you'd change sidewalks if you met them in real life, and The Girl on the Train more than delivered on both scores. The prose is lovely and flows well despite the necessary narrative gaps (when you're dealing with a narrator who routinely blacks out, there are going to be sudden breaks in the stream of consciousness). The whodunit aspect (even once I realized there was something someone might have done, which isn't clear for about a third of the book) kept me guessing until the last few chapters. But in the spirit of Gone Girl, it doesn't really matter if you can figure out the key to the mystery, because even once the puzzle pieces are neatly laid out, there's still tension in the story. There's a lot about this that reminded me of Before I Go to Sleep - same unreliable narrator idea, same dubious cast of secondary characters all up to no good. The not-so-neat division between male violence and female enabling of said violence. The whole play on agency and manipulation is obviously something I like, so this very much hit the spot. Recommended. "
177,Janet Clysdale,"I loved this book. It was gripping, suspenseful and unlike some of the books I have read this one kept me guessing right until the end. Well written, engaging characters. Highly Recommend."
178,Đorđe Bajić,"Roman me je prijatno iznenadio. Mnogi su ga uporedili sa ""Iščezlom"", mada mene više podeća na ""Pre nego što zaspim"" - priča je svedena, likova nema puno, a atmofera je krajnje turobna i elegična. Glavna junakinja je Rejčel, alkoholičarka koja nikako ne može da se oporavi nakon razvoda. Nakon što u njenom bivšem komšiluku nestane žena, Rejčel počinje da se interesije za taj slučaj - nestalu i njenog muža je, naime, viđala gotovo svakodnevno pošto je voz kojim je išla za London pravio kratke pauze u blizini njihove kuće. Rejčel je isprva idealizovala mladi par, čak im i zavidela, ali uskoro postaje očigledno da je idila bila samo opsena.

179,Chad Saunders,"I don't want to take the chance of giving anything away with this book. I just want to tell you to read it. It doesn't matter what type of genre you are into, you will enjoy this debut novel by a great new talent. I was sucked in immediately by Paula Hawkins use of words alone this is a finely crafted, well thought out story that keeps you wanting to know, what is going to happen next. I read the entire book in less than 24 hours. I just really could not put it down. I've gone through passages of the book again already and you can see that all the details of what is to come is plainly laid out from the start of the novel. I cannot wait to read future books by Paula Hawkins. "
180,Heather Probst,"A page turner for sure, I couldn't put it down and it kept me guessing while on the edge of my seat. Excellent read!"
181,Susie,"Best book I've read in a long while! If you haven't read it, READ IT. "
182,Aubrey,"Really good read. I love that I can't say, 'I knew it was ****!!! until I was almost done with this book. It was a hell of a ride for Rachel and Megan."
183,Neha,Quite the page turner! Hard not to love this book. 
184,Mary Woollard,I really enjoyed this book! Suspenseful and addicting! I can't wait to see how the movie turns out!
185,Gina,"Hard to believe that ""The Girl on the Train"" is Paula Hawkin's first novel. Loved it and looking forward to reading more books by her!"
186,Debbie Tanner,"This murder mystery was terrific! It's told from the point of view of three different young women over the course of a few weeks, with flashbacks to a year earlier. The three women at first seem very different but as you continue to read you find how similar they are. It has lots of great plot twists and what seems like a very accurate depiction of what it's like to be an alcoholic. It was fabulous!"
187,Lana Tracy,one of my favorite fun reads! Rarely do the clues keep you guessing until pretty close to the end and Hawkins achieves just that. her characters are unique and the story had me unable to put the book down for any length of time. highly recommend as an engaging intriguing read.
188,Kiersten,"Every character in this book was a total mess and almost entirely unredeemable (with the exception of the main character, Rachel who, while a total mess and difficult to like, was at least not a completely terrible person); so if you need your books to be filled with likable characters, don't bother with The Girl on the Train. Despite that, I absolutely loved this book. There were a few points in the book where I was convinced the ending would be predictable and I knew what was going to happen, and I was always wrong. It was incredibly easy to get into, and within the first few pages I was hooked. "
189,Ware,"An unreliable narrator witnesses something. She takes the train every day, allegedly to work, but at a job which is no longer hers, past her old home where her ex lives with his new wife and their baby. She constructs romantic stories of the lives of her former neighbor and sometimes exits the train to wander drunkenly up and down the street.Something happens to her near her old home.. But even a physical assault can be a confused occurrence which lacks connection to reality. The perfect couple in a house exactly like hers has issues. She sees something. Then that perfect wife goes missing. She has seen something, but cannot recount it accurately. Her drinking is out of control again.This is a work of misogyny and murder. The women are driven apart and then together by their shared betrayal. It is a difficult read, and a book I put down several times only to be drawn back into its web. Even as it hurtles towards revelation, it remains dark, grim and confused. It will disturb you. It will frighten you. It will enlighten you as well."
190,Jeanne,"""Now look. Now look what you made me do.""A great psychological thriller with twist and turns reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock's best works. The narrators are 3 women who appear different but whose lives are linked in unexpected ways. This book has murder, mystery, and flawed characters whose behaviors can be frustrating to the reader until we get to know their histories. They are imperfect people trying to find a perfect life. Great character studies delve into how the mind perceives events and protects us in times of severe stress and trauma. While the main mystery may be solved by some readers, I liked that there were still a few surprises after the ""end."" Highly recommend."
191,Megan Johnson,"I loved this book, but in an odd way it also annoyed me. Let me try to explain. As someone who has had experience with alcoholics in the past, I found the portrayal of alcoholism to be hardly believable. Although this sort of experience may be the case for some, it made me have a much more difficult time relating to the character. I feel like I would have enjoyed it even more had there been less of an emphasis on her drinking - but that is of course a choice that the author made and it certainly didn't ruin the book for me. Other than this, I found this to be one of the best books I have read in a while. I read it over the course of a weekend and when I finished I had that post-great-book anxiety that I wouldn't enjoy the next book that I picked up because I enjoyed this one so much. If you want a book that's easy to read, full of surprises, and that you know everyone will be talking about for the next year: read this. I highly recommend it.

192,April Southern,"I was very happy with this book. Saw it at the store and looked interesting, did not know what it was about but I knew I had to read it. Can't wait to see the movie. "
193,Aisha,"Wow! I didn't expect to like this so much but this is just so mysteriously different. Very reliable unreliable multiple POVs, I must say. There isn't a lot of action but it caught my full attention from page one. "
194,Keyshia Dorsey,really enjoyed this one. halfway through i thought that i knew who did it but i was pleasantly surprised that i was wrong. 
195,Palomiix,"Escribo esto mientras trato de recuperar el aliento. A pesar de que empieza un poco más lento de lo que esperaba no tarda en coger carrerilla para no soltarte hasta el final, y es que la necesidad de saber qué narices había pasado era demasiado grande. Tanta que me he pasado unos días en los que no quería comer ni dormir, ni hacer otra cosa que no fuera seguir leyendo. Y lo más importante, el final está muy a la altura a pesar de todo lo que se enreda la trama.Y Rachel, oh dios, pobre Rachel. Me daban ganas de traspasar las páginas, abrazarla y decirle que todo acabaría saliendo bien. Aunque si yo estuviera en su situación, estaría mucho peor que ella. Vaya personas con las que tiene la mala suerte de cruzarse. Son todos, sin excepción, para darles de comer aparte. Y pensar que existirá gente así...Después de todo lo dicho, qué ganas de leer más cosas de la autora. "
196,Lindsay Cummings,Great twist ending! I loved it! (my first adult book ever lol. no shame!)
197,Jane Ainslie,"I loved this book. I couldn't put it down, which is something I yearn for when I'm reading a book. In fact, I was about thirty pages from the end the day I finished it, and I was running late for my shift at the hospital because I HAD to see what happened. Thankfully, my shift got cancelled, and my first thought was 'thank goodness', I can stay here and find out what happens. Great read, great story. "
198,Sanela,"Loved this book so so much. Also loved the added Bosnian character since I'm Bosnian. Not one of the narrators in the book was likable but that's what I loved about it! Rachel made so many HORRIBLE choices and I couldn't help but cringe reading her narrative every single time. Anna and her self righteous indignation over Rachel ""interrupting"" her life had me boiling with anger. And Megan was a lost soul that I just couldn't help but feel the most sorry for. She is one of those people that is never satisfied with her life no matter what. She can't help being constantly miserable and making everyone around her miserable as well. The men of the book all appear fairly normal as compared to the women but the more I read the more I saw how horribly flawed they are. All in all I would recommend it to my friends ( and guess what: I have!)"
199,Paul,Brilliant.
200,Sameer khan,"""it’s possible to miss what you’ve never had, to mourn for it.""A psychological thriller with as appropriate a name as it can be. Though the protagonist is based in Asbury but most of the events unfold in a periodic train ride. Even though many of the reader would contemplate it as another ""Gone Girl"" as both give an impression of a psychological thriller. It is more of a whodunit story with an added psychological theme. The added psychological theme make the plot more circuitous and a game turner. The most salient feature of this book is how the reader is kept guessing till the first 100pages as to what the book is all about. The cases are strong and with an intriguing background. This book is surely a book worth your time."
201,Yumna,"The book didn't capture me at first. But, it had a sort of raw emotion that I feel like the author had captured very beautifully towards the middle of the book. I was quite early to catch on to the twist because Tom was a common factor for everything that had happened to Rachel. To be honest, I sympathise with him. He had several mental illnesses which he wasn't clinically diagnosed for. Being a BPD and a pathological liar, things you do aren't always reasonable, and his condition was far worse and scary too because he managed to live out a life while managing to fool two of the people he was most close to. I feel like if the author had highlighted his past and what made him like that, the book would have become even more of an excellent read. Nonetheless, I'll rate this book 5 stars because I was unable to put this book down after Scott found out about Rachel's lies. The book really took an interesting turn from then on! "
202,Kitty Jay,"The Girl on the Train earned instant accolades when it was released, even earning the Goodreads Best Reads award - and all of that is more than deserved. The story is told through the eyes of three characters: Rachel, an alcoholic who is still reeling from her divorce two years ago; Anna, former mistress now married to Rachel's ex-husband; Megan, the restless, discontent wife of a Scott whose disappearance sparks off the plot of the book. Rachel sees Megan and Scott every morning as she rides the train into London and makes up a rich fantasy life for them, living vicariously through this fantasy as a means of coping with her own failed marriage. When she reads of Megan's disappearance in the paper, she entangles herself into the investigation and finds herself caught up in a web of lies, affairs, and past secrets.Despite the fact that the ending was, unfortunately, spoiled for me, the mystery was still compelling. ""Thrillers"" have become synonymous with international espionage plots and two-dimensional Bond wannabe characters, but The Girl on the Train returns to the true meaning of thriller. The back-and-forth between characters and times circles the reader around the heart of the mystery, while the snippets that Rachel sees through the window of the train lend a voyeuristic air to the book.What truly impressed me, however, was the stunning characterization. Rachel is a deeply flawed character, a pathetic alcoholic who has to beg money from her mother since being fired from her job and routinely tries the patience of her friend/landlord. She never outright apologizes for her alcoholism or even seems cognizant of the depth of her addiction. Despite this, she is truly sympathetic. Her agony over being tossed aside for another woman who shares the seemingly perfect life with her ex-husband is palpable and touching. The reader can't help but feel pity and some disgust when she pines for her ex-husband even after two years, but still root for her. I'd like to make a special note that if you do not want to be spoiled over ""whodunnit"", do not click the spoiler block.(view spoiler)[Tom's characterization is another stunning example. It would have been so easy to go wrong with him. He could be awful, or, even worse, too likable. But Hawkins never misses a step. His seeming protectiveness over his new family is spoiled by the fact that he had an affair and left his wife in the first place. The way he talks Anna out of calling the police and tries to reason with Rachel's alarming behavior paints him sympathetically, but not too much. And, most chilling, is the end. The actual confession wasn't that shocking, but the way Rachel realizes that he believes his own lies sent a chill up my spine.The only place I felt it faltered was with Anna, who seemed unreasonably calm toward the end. I could see her being afraid for her child, but she actually entertains the idea that she would be so happy to be rid of Rachel that she would be happy with Tom - despite him confessing to an affair, a murder, and assaulting his ex-wife in front of her. I just couldn't suspend my disbelief at that part. I understand that the point was to show how desperately she wanted that perfect fantasy life, the kind that Rachel manufactured for Scott and Megan, and the kind that Megan yearned for but could never quite achieve, but ... seriously? (hide spoiler)]The book was a classic, and it's easy to see why it gained so much notoriety. This is a chilling, compelling, and imminently readable book, one that shows effortless talent by Paula Hawkins. If you haven't read it yet, do so.

203,Danielle Parker,TRUST NO ONE!
204,Marie Gentilcore,"What a fabulous ride! I had so much fun reading this book. It kept me guessing and I had a really hard time putting it down. The story is told primarily by the main character Rachel aka the girl on the train. And like many commuters she looks out the window as she rides and she happens to notice a couple she sees all the time who she names Jess and Jason. Then one day she sees something upsetting, something she just can't let go, and the ride begins. The characters were all really good, there are a lot of twists and turns, and I thought the ending was very satisfying."
205,Jalyn,This was so good! This is definitely a good choice for anybody looking for something as messed up and intense as Gone Girl. I was hooked from the beginning!
206,Tired CNA,Fantastic. One of the few books I have ever read where I hated all the characters but loved the story.Really kept me guessing. Felt a tiny bit ripped off because I didn't feel they gave you enough clues to acurately guess till the very end. still an excellent book.

208,LittleDeadRedGoddess,"I know there are a lot of comparisons to Gone Girl and though there were similarities the books are really very different. There is a beautiful blonde wife that goes missing and the book is told in the narrative of a few people but this one feels different. I never actually liked anyone i Gone Girl from the start where as here I liked Rachel. yes, she has a drinking problem and she makes many stupid mistakes but there is something about her that makes you root for her. You want her to fix herself, get her act together and you worry about here. I won't go into details because you get all you need about the book by reading the blurb. I will just say that the mystery is good and I really had a hard time putting the book down. I finished it in one day."
209,Amanda Hall,"It's probably a 4/5 star read- It's not perfect, but it is really, really good. It's compulsively readable and fast paced. The narrators are unreliable which leaves you guessing up to the end (although what happened is what I thought happened, I wouldn't have been surprised if it would have gone another way.) "
210,Dana ****Reads Alot****,What a roller coaster ride. I honestly had no clue who did it till the very end. I love that in a book. This was brilliantly written and again people. .no comparison with Gone Girl. Rachel took the train everyday and she came to see a couple in their yard she started fantasizing about how happy they were and then one day she sees something the wife has done. I secretly think she took train to spy on ex husband who lives in same row complex . She thinks they have this picture perfect marriage ( Scott & Megan) she becomes involved in their life after a tragedy and falsely lets Scott believe she is Megan's friend. This is where all leads to disaster. like a train collision of very own. Rachel was lonely and a drinker unhappy with life . Her husband had an affair and married Anna and they lived in her old home and had a child together. something she could not give Tom. I felt sorry for her she was lonely and was looking for an escape into someone else's life .Anna I disliked from the beginning and still disliked her in the end. Scott and Anna would be perfect together. both narcissistic in every way. They are not connected in anyway but should of been.I highly recommend this book for a good mystery . Every page kept me wanting to know more. I will definately read more of her future books to come. I was not dissatisfied.
211,Lynn Farina,"4.75 stars. This book drew me in immediately. It was just as gripping and suspenseful as ""Gone Girl"", but with a MUCH more satisfying ending. I knocked off a quarter of a star though because I guessed ""who did it"" about 75% of the way in. About 80% in is when shit hit the fan, I was SO close to having my mind blown by the outcome! I would recommend ""The Girl on the Train"" to anyone who loves mysteries/thrillers. Absolutely fantastic read!"
212,Nopysmurf,"I love this book. I used to read a lot but after I became the victim of depression I don't read that often anymore. Most books bore me to the bones. But I love this book because I have actually experienced the feelings that Rachel has been experiencing.The author seems to have a deep understanding on a variety of psychological phenomena, depression, self consciousness, anxiety, paranioa, insomnia, anger, disgust, blackout, distrustfulness, and vulnerabilty.For me, this book is about the portrayal of the nature and the interplay of these phenomena through main characters. Love it.Love it to the bones."
213,Vonnies Good,Great book. Couldn't put it down.

215,Tim The Enchanter," My Number 3 Best Read of 2015, Gold Gavel Winner for Best Novel of 2015 and Gavel Award for Best First Novel Revised and Posted to  The Literary Lawyer 
 A Dazzling Debut - 5 Stars 
This is easily amongst the best debut novels I have ever read. The story was taunt, the characters deeps and developed and the mystery and suspense had me guessing from start to finish. Regardless of the fact that it was an incredibly polished first novel, this book would have received 5 stars if it was the 1st or 15th book by this author. While this is one of the best books I have read this year, it will not be for everyone. It does bear similarities to several other ""buzzy"" books over the past couple of years.  Gone Girl  and  Before I Go to Sleep  are the first two that come to mind. Since I haven't yet posted those reviews, I can tell you that I loved Gone Girl and hated Before I Go to Sleep. If you liked one of the two aforementioned novels, you will probably enjoy this one. The Plot The story is told from the perspective of three different characters. Rachel, the girl on the train, Anna, the wife of the Divorcee and Megan, the missing wife. The story opens with Rachel on the train and her daily commute into the city. Deeply unhappy as a result of a broken relationship and struggling with addiction, she finds herself creating an idealized narrative based on her observations of a husband and wife she sees daily outside the window of her train car. Her fantasy narrative is shattered when she notices changes at the home and the women, through whom she was living vicariously, goes missing. Rachael realizes that On the night the Megan goes missing, she had been in that neighbourhood, drunk and disoriented and left with vague memories. Are these memories keys to solving Meagan's disappearance. The plot intricately weaves the complex narratives of these three women and the three men in their lives. One of these six has committed a crime but their narratives are so closely entwined that you will believe each one of them is the guilty party. My Take This book has received plenty of buzz and has continually been referred to as the ""next  Gone Girl . In some ways this is a fair comparison. Both books have generally unlikable characters, intense human drama, crime, passion, neurosis, unreliable narrators, multiple perspectives of the same events and provide and intense study of the characters. I think it is fair to suggest that if you did not like  Gone Girl  you are unlikely to enjoy this novel. That said, this is not is not the little sister to  Gone Girl  and while each character is unlikeable in some way, some of elements of their personality leave room for sympathy. While the former may have attributed to the success of the latter, it tells a far more complex tale and provide a more compelling mystery.While there is little to like about each of the 6 major characters - Rachel, Megan, Anna, Scott, Tom and Kamal - they do retain some positive qualities despite the fact that each of them can serve as poster children for one or more of each of the Seven Deadly Sins. Often times, unlikable characters will drag a story down if it is not mitigated. In my opinion, the mitigating factor in this book is the intense character study of each of the three women. Their perspectives of the events were intensely clouded by their own failings, shortcomings and addictions but each character was so expertly crafted that you began to understand their motivations even if you didn't agree with them. In my opinion, insight into a character is far more important than liking the character. Personally, I find the best and most compelling novels that focus on the characters and their development. This is one of the best examples of this in recent memory. While the actions and attitudes of the characters are distasteful, immoral and selfish, their motivations are explored but never excused. The book doesn't ask you to like the characters or approve of their actions. It doesn't ask you to share their perspective or accept their actions but does provide you the opportunity to understand the minds that propel the characters. Within a single page you will find yourself both intrigued and repelled, fascinated and disgusted, confused and accepting.Given the clouded perspectives, the narration tends to be unreliable. Rachel is unable to rely on her own memory at the best of times. Add in memories shrouded by a blackout and the reader is often unsure of what to believe. While this could have resulted in much frustration, the author provided a vein of reliable narration from Megan which serves to stabilize the whole novel. Final Thoughts  The Girl on the Train  is a wonderful example of compelling mystery and complex character development. Chances are that you will not say ""Aha! I knew it was ""_________"" all along"" but rather, ""I though it could have been them"". While in  Gone Girl  the mystery played second fiddle to the characters,  Girl on the Train  uses the mystery as a vital element in the development of each character. Truly one of the best books I have read this year. Audiobook Notes I listened to audiobook version of the novel. Each of the women had their own narrator and each narrator did a wonderful job. The narrator that voiced Rachel was especially good at infusing emotion into her voice. This book is tailor made for an audiobook and I highly recommend the format."
216,Anita Vela,"Buah, me ha gustado tanto esta lectura que no sé muy bien que decir porque tampoco os quiero contar mucho, pienso que es un libro que hay que leer sin mucha información sobre él.Este libro trata sobre Rachel que todos los días coge siempre el mismo tren a la misma hora. Ese tren siempre para en un semáforo y justo se para al lado de una urbanización y a Rachel le llama la atención una casa que vive una pareja y ella se imagina la vida perfecta y feliz de ellos, pero un día sucede algo, algo ve Rachel y entonces es cuando empieza la historia. Y hasta aquí puedo contaros, pero digamos que el libro trata de resolver que es lo que ve Rachel aquel día.Para empezar tengo que decir que los personajes me han encantado, están muy bien definidos dentro de su locura. Mi favorita es Rachel, aunque he tenido sentimientos encontrados con ella porque me tiraba por la borda todas mis “teorías” y literalmente, me estaba volviendo loca.En cuanto a la trama… me volvía loca con mis teorías que me cambiaban a casi cada capítulo pero es una de las cosas que más me han gustado y reconozco que cuando iba por la mitad del libro estaba deseando leerme el último capítulo para saber la verdad y acabar con esta locura. También me ha gustado mucho la forma de escribir de esta autora, hace que te enganches a la historia de tal forma que no puedes parar de leer. Te hace creer una cosa y luego te la cambia con otra teoría y así… la verdad que juega muy bien ese papel para confundirte de tal manera que crees volverte loca como la protagonista.En cuanto al final, la gente tiene muchas quejas de que es predecible y muy típico, pero a mí me ha gustado. Hasta unas 90 páginas de terminar el libro no tenía una teoría clara de lo que estaba sucediendo y además pasan cosas que me dejaron muy loca, tanto en el final como en casi todo el libro. Y sí, me gusta como termina, aunque por ponerle una pega me hubiera gustado un final más feliz. Ya nos digo más, creo que es suficiente y os lo recomiendo mucho, tenéis que leerlo. Este libro se va directamente a la lista de mis mejores lecturas del 2015."
217,Justine Morency,"Well the book was intense, that's an understanding. I usually don't really read mystery books but with this one, I couldn't put it down. The story start calm and normal with Rachel on the train going to work and seeing a couple in a house that she named Jess and Jason. She loved their relationship, she even get jealous until one day going home, on the train, she sees Jess also named Megan doing something unexpected. The next day she is gone missing. Rachel couldn't help but tell what she saw to Jason, well Scott. Soon she find herself into the mystery and there is no way to get out of this mess. She tries to help to search where is Jess and at the same time, she tries change her bad habits. We follow the life of Rachel, Anna and Megan as the accident just happened. To see three different point of view was really great because when we thought that we would find some clue, it changed point of view. Also the fact that these three woman, who we thought didn't have a lot in common really do. The end is really not what we would except and it really took me by surprise. The cleverness of the author who wrote at the beggining two little paragraph before the first chapter and in fact that reveal to be really important. I also appreciated the fact that the character have flaws and qualities, basically the fact that they aren't perfect make the story even better. "
218,Liz Stahl,Loved the book! 
219,Cheryl A. Clarke,Twists and turns right to the endThe ultimate whodunit. This book is hard to put down and leaves you wanting more. As as matter of fact I do.
220,Melissapalmer404,"Book #16 Read in 2015The Girl on the Train by Paula HawkinsPeople have been comparing this book to Gone Girl and that comparison is pretty spot on as this thriller has not-so-likable characters and a plot that will keep you reading and unable to put the book down. Rachel has lost her job due to her drinking problem but in order to not have her roommate find out, she continues her daily train commute. This ride has her passing her old house, where her ex-husband now lives with his new wife and baby daughter, and a house nearby where a young couple lives. Rachel invents names and a storyline for this couple and feels as if she knows them. The wife then turns up missing and Rachel is drawn into trying to find out what happened. The plot has many twists and turns and will keep readers hooked from beginning to end. I highly recommend it.http://melissasbookpicks.blogspot.com"
221,Squid McFinnigan,"Right out, I have to say I enjoyed this book hugely. All the characters were very flawed in their own individual ways, which I guess makes them very real, but I was dying to give Rachel a bit of a slap and tell her to get a hold of her self during the first hundred pages, but then that kind of helplessness is what is most destructive with her character flaws. Once the build up was over, the action keeps flowing and with several twists and turns it leads quickly to an extremely satisfying ending.It is heavily woman focused, but that is what I expected from the title. Its nice to get an insight into the minds of the more powerful gender, and see that they too have feet of clay."
222,Ashlee Nishiya,This book kept me guessing throughout. It was a compelling and quick read. It reminded me of Gone Girl and I can totally see it as a book. It's just a matter of time. 
223,Elle ✦ Pretty Little Books ✦," :: 5 Addicting Stars :: My first thought after reading this book was “yup, it lived up to the hype”. This is a fantastic debut novel- one that I won’t soon forget. Does it live up to the Gone Girl status? Yes, in a way it does. The story has the same type of unreliable narrator who is suffering from her own problems and us readers don’t know whether to believe her or not. Can we readers guess who is behind Megan’s disappearance? Nope. I wanted to think I knew who did it, but when I really found out I was as shocked as everyone else. This book is awesome, albeit, a bit dark and depressing. I had so many feelings while reading this that my head started to spin! Honestly, if you haven’t picked this one up yet than I implore you to do so. It’s just a very, very, good book! No wonder it got a goodreads award!Anyway, the book is about a woman named Rachel who rides the same commuter train every day. At first I wanted to believe it was because she had to work like everyone else, but I was lead to believe wrong. You see, Rachel is hiding from her demons. She lost her job because she is an alcoholic and is trying to hide this news from her flat mate. It’s crazy how well Rachel is hiding her wrong-doings and I can’t help as a reader feeling a bit bad for her. So what Rachel does on this train (each, and every day) is watch the houses go by. But not only this, she fantasizes about the people who live there. You see, she is already familiar with this neighborhood as she used to live there- with her husband- until he left her for another woman. And stranger things continue to happen- her ex-husband now lives in the same house he shared with her, with the woman he left her for. Pretty twisted if you ask me! Either way, Rachel’s fantasizing, her mixed up emotions for her ex-husband and his new wife, and now a murder mystery begins to plague Rachel’s life. She starts with one bad decision- and her life begins to spin even more out of control than it was previously. Yikes! The happenings in this book are quite unbelievable and twisted.Overall, I loved everything about this book. It’s dark, twisted, depressing, and unique. The author has quite the imagination and she certainly brings it to life in this book. Again, if you haven’t read it than you should! It’s awesome. I can’t wait to see what the author thinks up next! "
224,Jenna Warren,"So, my new pet peeve is when literary critics refer to a new, well-written psychological thriller as the ""next Gone Girl."" I absolutely loved Gone Girl. However, I do not think that this book resembles that book in as many ways as these critics make it seem. There are similarities, certainly. It is a psychological thriller and incredibly well-written. The plot is confusing and ironic, as it is intended. The most valuable qualities of this book are the irony and character development. Without giving any spoilers away, I will just say that I am just so pleased I read this book. It was enthralling, emotionally provoking and ironic. "
225,Sue Frances,"A fantastic read! I really enjoyed this book. The suspense builds nicely, so you cant stop reading, wanting to know whats going to happen next."
226,Meghan Kavanaugh,"I can't stop thinking about this one. If you're a fan of Gone Girl, you'll like this book. More damaged people trying to out crazy each other, and I didn't guess the ending."
227,Jessica Daley,Thought the book was awesome. Quick read and an excellent thriller. 
228,Nicole LaGonterie,"I have to say that this book was riveting! From the moment I started reading it I couldn't put it down. It's full of mystery, suspense, and secrets. If you're looking for a thriller Paula Hawkins debut novel will not disappoint. I strongly recommend reading this!"
229,Ceri,Amazing Finished in 6 days Can imagine this being a film one day Chapters similar to gone girl 
230,Margaret Bryant,"Smart, clever, original. Very enjoyable. "
231,Tenasitee,Loved it 
232,Fiona Hewlett-parker,"Simply excellent! A very intricate story, where nothing is quite what it seems and no-one can be trusted. I loved this book! "
233,Dan Perez,I have to admit. this book was awesome although it dealt with some erratic personalities. my mind was extremely wrapped in a ton of different directions. Rachel is a crazy jealous lonely individual. Anna I felt was a ticking time bomb. Megan was a ticking time bomb. the author completely fooled me in every part of the book. I recommend this book to readers who like suspense and readers who can have a good imagination. I had to reread multiple sections throughout the book to make sure I understood certain things.take your time when reading this book and understand that most of the readings are from the characters minds. I just really enjoyed reading this book. the author Paula Hawkins will have a tough time making her next book just as good as this one
234,Cherie ,"POV: Alternating first person between Rachel, Anna and MeganIt's been a few days now since I finished The Girl on the Train. I waited to write this review because I felt like I needed to mull things over, let things marinate in my head, before trying to write down my thoughts. My initial rating was four stars but this book has stayed with me. I keep thinking about it and remembering things and making connections. It's definitely a book that I would re-read and for that reason, I've since bumped up my rating to a full five stars. Reading this book felt somewhat voyeuristic because these characters and their lives are completely raw and gritty and we see far beyond the masks they each wear day to day. That voyeuristic feel is apropos because Rachel, in turn, is also a voyeur who peeks into the backyards of her ex-husband and their neighbors while riding the train every day. All of the characters, and the narrators in particular are, by turns, sympathetic and also horribly disgusting human beings. Their personalities are each distinct yet they each have this pervading darkness. The book blurb does a pretty good job of giving an idea of the plot without giving anything away so I won't rehash it here. This book will grab you right from the beginning. Rachel is like a train wreck and it's hard not to watch. As the book unfolds, though, you'll be sucked in even deeper and start to see connections everywhere. All three of the narrators are unreliable so with each chapter, the reader gets another piece of the puzzle and another suspicion. This is not a traditional ""whodunnit"" kind of mystery, but suspicion does fall on just about every character at some point in the book. And none of them are ruled out until the very end. I had no idea where this train was going to take me until I ended up there. I think the comparisons to Gone Girl are deserved. Although the plots are not really similar, they both have flawed and unreliable narrators and a dark and gritty feel to them. They both are layered exceptionally well and you won't know what's going on until the author wants you to. "
235,Natasha,"I don't remember the last time I started and finished a book in one day, but this was a definite page-turner. I enjoyed it immensely and found it completely unpredictable. I definitely recommend it!"
236,Denise Shipp,"I don't 'listen' to books. I haven't had a book read to me since I was little. Since I started taking the bus though, I have found that listening to a book is better than trying to focus on a page on my kindle. So the first book I started listening to was this one...and I couldn't stop! The story had me hooked from the first word and I was anxious to hear what happened next! The readers gave the story so much character and I learned to love/hate them as the story unfolded. As for the story itself, it had everything...drama, suspense, humor, romance (a little twisted but it was there). If you do nothing else, read this book. Or listen to it...you will not regret it!"
237,Nora Nelly,Wow just wow! I don't even know what to say this book was so good I read more than half of it today. This is what a thriller is supposed to be like. This book has literally left me speechless. 
238,Inaniel,What a surprise. I didn't exspect it to be so good. Thrilling till the last page. Very well written. I read it in two nights instead of sleeping because it was so good. Now I'm tired. It was worth it.
239,Laura Ellison,"So many suspects, so many forgotten/missing memories, and so much booze lead to an interesting mystery told through three women's perspectives. One is unreliable because she drinks, a lot. One is narrow and hateful. One is immature and unstable. The most likable character is the drunkard. We get her perspective the most but her memory of the night when Megan goes missing is like Swiss cheese. Until she finally remembers, her Nancy Drew investigation takes you on a roller coaster ride of intrigue and bad decisions. I hate that the characters weren't more likable as a whole but still really enjoyed the story. "
240,Milu♡,"Rachel una alcohólica, divorciada hace un tiempo, a causa de que su marido tenía un amante, Anna, quién estaba embarazada. Rachel tenía una vida miserable, lo único que alegraba su día, el amargo sabor del vino rozándole sus labios, según ella el alcohol la dejaba dormir.

Es el primer libro así que leo y me quedé sorprendida de lo mucho que me gustó. La chica del tren, puede llegar a complacer todas tus expectivativas y a la vez asustarte, incluso llegué a dudar de mí misma. "
241,Galina,"After reading ''sample'' I have not any doubt,I want to read this book.I am happy I was not disappointed and even more ,I was terrified.Detective story is the perfect frame interweave thoughts and contemplations and demonstrate truly curious way of processing information by our brain.I love the plot and alive psychological characteristics .The way of writing senses like free and easy breathing .The protagonist has really nobel personality and, despite of alcohol addiction she is fighter.It turned out,nothing is what it seems. "
242,Craig,"This was an awesome Audiobook as the women who played Rachel really made it come to life. She made you feel sorry for her, where as the actor playing Anna made her seem like a total bitch. I found it quite interesting as the story switched points of view through the book and you got bits and pieces of the whole story, it was all ties together nicely in the end. "
243,Vicki Jensen,A Real Page Turner with A Surprise EndingYou won't go wrong with this book. Terrific character descriptions - I feel like I can see them all. A wild ride!
244,Jennifer Gutierrez,this book had me thinking from beginning to end. Amazing thriller!
245,Susie Biancarelli-leo,Loved it. Great psychological thriller with highly x#%ed up characters. 
246,Heather Dorsey,I loved the concept of how this book is written. The story's main character rides a train each morning and evening to get to London. She always watches for her old neighborhood and discovers a couple in one house that catches her attention. She creates a story of their life.The book starts with the thoughts of the main character on the Morning and Evening train rides. Soon two other characters thoughts are added.The books is captivating and I couldn't put it down. If I didn't have to teach school I would have never left my bed so I could finish.
247,Eileen,"There has been a lot of media attention comparing this to Gone Girl but I found them to be quite different although I read and enjoyed them both. The main character in Girl on the Train is seriously flawed and has some issues but still manages to be a sympathetic character and one you want to root for. It is the kind of book you can't give details about without spoiling the ending. Suffice it to say it was suspenseful, well written and guaranteed to keep you turning those pages to find out what happen next. A very enjoyable read."
248,Steph Post,"I was worried this book wasn't going to live up to all the hype- but trust me, it did. This was a delicious suspense tale that absolutely delivers on the twists and turns. From a craft standpoint, Hawkins does some amazing things with narrative distance and delivery that add to, and certainly don't overshadow, the drama. I rarely call books ""page-turning,"" but this one definitely earns that description. All around good storytelling. "
249,Cassandra,"It has been a long time since I've read a book that I had serious trouble putting down. Like avoiding social situations trouble. Staying up late when I have to work the next day. Creepily dreaming about it. What a thrill! And don't even compare it to Gone Girl (other than the fact that it's also about a missing woman, switches perspectives, etc.) because Gone Girl was not 1/5th the book this was! Nick and Amy Dunne = BORING. Never mind about them, this is a different review. But I would hate it to hear if you didn't read this because you didn't like Gone Girl.But the story in TGOTT--- the intensely human and flawed characters... the twisted relationships... the nail biting edge of your seat suspense! A twist worth waiting for! What a ride."
250,Rhonda,"I absolutely loved this book! I found when I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about it. It is one of the best thrillers I have read in a while. I highly recommend it. "
251,Lisa Mcallister,"Oh my gosh - hated to finish this. The storyline played with my brain and Gripped me to the end. Reminded me of Gone Girl, and a little bit of We were Liars."
252,Lea Ludwig,"Loved this physiological thriller, read it late into the night until it was over. It is very well written. I loved the way the author slowly revealed the story. The format is my favorite type of read...flipping back and forth between characters, and their perspectives of what is happening. I spend a lot of time speculating on what was going on. The main character is hopeless yet very sympathetic, you can't help but like her. Very happy I read this....I expect there will be a lot of talk and attention given to this book. One question that I am going to submit to the author...is there any significance to the cover of the book? The paper is very rough and coarse....very satisfying to hold this book as opposed to reading it on ipad/kindle, etc. Enjoy!"
253,Angela,So good!!!!!
254,Shajuana,"I thoroughly enjoyed this read. This story was not predictable, halfway through I had no idea what exactly had happened and was genuinely surprised by the twists. I definitely can see this going to film."
255,Maddie,"Amazing book and audiobook. The three perspectives of events that occurred over the course of about a year were interesting, insightful and misleading. The use of three different narrators in the audiobook for the three different women's perspectives really made this work. I've already started listening to the audiobook again and picking up on all of the clues and the pieces that I missed or misunderstood now that I have new context with the resolution. At times I found myself disliking ALL of the narrators but I think that makes their characters more real. A captivating book. "
256,Milly Cohen,"Ufff, buenísimo!Bien por la autora, muy bien por este csi-novelón!"
257,Pamela Sweezy,I loved this book from the first chapter!
258,Nicole Dingman,"Just finished The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins. I can honestly say, this was the best book I've read in quite a while. I literally could not wait to pick it up again. I found myself listening to it like junkie. The story is about an alcoholic, who blacks out quite often. She spends her life taking the train passed her old house, obsessing about her ex-husband and his new wife. She also the fantasizes about a couple she sees at this station regularly, imagining they are perfect in every way. One problem – The wife of the so-called perfect couple ends up missing.  I don't know what else Paula Hawkins has written, if anything, but I do know I'll be looking for it and it will be on the top of my list! 5 out of 5 stars"
259,Nancy Kroneberger,"Excellent book! Grabs you in from the get-go. Suspenseful. Intriguing. Surprising. Deep characters and complex plot. Sad and a little hard to read how Rachel struggles so with alcohol. (Though I must admit I could relate and understand from the perspective of someone that has always struggled trying to get a handle on her weight!) Shows the depth of evil, hatred, apathy, and selfishness in humanity. Surprising ending. Well-written and cleverly arranged, told from the perspective of three different women. Highly recommended. Fast read. "
260,Holly,This book was amazing. Highly recommend 
261,Tina Ballin,"It amazes me that authors can dream up such wacked out, disturbed characters!"
262,Romina,"So when I first started the book I felt as if it was written by an amateur writer. Then I read the black flap and realized this is her first thriller. I didn't mind the writing style that much. It was more of a journalist style—sth I was made sure of after reading the black flap. But the plot was perfect and she did a good enough job to pull it off. Somehow I got so absorbed that I didn't even pay attention to the writing any longer. The book was magnificent. Heart breakingly perfect. Absolutely stunning. I loved it. Love, love, love. It absorbed me and left me hungry for answers in a way I haven't been in a long time. It ended perfectly. Everything was so aligned that the ending seemed right even if I hadn't imagined it. The ending didn't come out of nowhere. There was facts all along that made the ending seem logical in a way most authors can't pull off. Half way through the story and I was already praying that Rachel isn't the murderer. The plot was beautifully thought of. All the details exactly in place. The writing improved throughout the story but all in all everything was so perfect that after a couple chapters I was so absorbed I completely forgot about it. If u haven't ever willingly picked up a book to read, let this be ur first. If u have then u will never regret reading this. I have read a rough 100 books since the beginning of 2015 and this has got to be in my top 5. "
263,Deborah Markus,"The short review: Fangirling. Just totally could not get enough of this story. Stayed up late reading and then got up early to read. ON A SUNDAY, PEOPLE. Sleeping until 9:00 has been my idea of church for years now. NOT TODAY. Read this while I was brushing my teeth and washing my face. Wanted to take it with me on my jog. Resented ""having"" to go to a concert I was lucky enough to get free tickets to – yes, the music was exquisite, but why did it have to be playing today when I HADN'T FINISHED THIS BOOK YET? Holy carp, what a rollercoaster.The more coherent review: The writing reminds me a lot of Shirley Jackson, which is the highest compliment I can give. The structure is innovative, and Paula Hawkins knows how to give out just enough information to keep you running after more, but doesn't tease so mercilessly that you want to throw the book across the room.It wasn't just the plotline that kept me glued to this book. (I'm barely exaggerating about that glue. I took it with me in my purse to that concert so I could read during the intermission, and actually tried to prop it up in such a way that I could read while I was making the bed. That's a cry for help, folks.) It was the way Hawkins forced me to rethink and reexamine all my assumptions about the various characters. This story goes way beyond anything as simple as an unreliable narrator. THE WORLD is unreliable. Until it isn't. Until the right people have the courage to look squarely at what's in front of them, instead of being distracted by what they want to believe.I am out of my mind over this book, and I'm afraid that'll ruin it for some readers because come on – how could it live up to this kind of hype? (I tried to read while shaving my legs. In the tub, with shaving cream and a new blade in my razor. I'm almost sad that didn't kill me, because it would have made one hell of an obituary.)So don't read The Girl on the Train just because I raved about it. Check out a few pages and see if it grabs you.I'm just saying, every once in a while a book goes bestseller because it's really, really good.P.S. Don't forget to reread the first couple of pages immediately after you finish this novel. Paula Hawkins pulls a bit of The Sound and the Fury action at the beginning of GOTT – not enough to drive a reader nuts, just enough to keep you wondering."
264,Mary Jo Burke,"Excellent story told from three points of view, plenty of plot twists, and perfect ending!"
265,Samantha Jo,Completely didn't see the end turning out the way it did. Great book!
266,Charlene Intriago,"One of those that once you start it, you can't put it down!!"
267,Melissa Crory,"So many good books this year! One of my favorite literary devices is a good unreliable narrator. This book has one of the best. Highly recommended for a fairly easy read packed with excitement. A good, respectable beach book. "
268,Ericka,"In a word, or rather a phrase, The Girl on the Train is a HOT MESS, but in a good way! It was such an intriguing web of lies, mystery, and perspectives. The story is told by 3 different narrators: Rachel, Megan, and Anna. Just when I thought I had it all figured out, a different perspective was revealed that made me totally question what I “thought” I had figured out and sometimes the revealed information blew my current theory clear out of the water.I found the story to be somewhat slow to start, but the tempo picked up as the other narrator’s perspectives were shared. At first, I found the broken storyline that is split between the present (Summer 2013) and the past (approximately 1 year prior that progresses to the current day) somewhat confusing, but after a while I adjusted and it became easier. The mix of the various narrator’s perspectives and the back and forth between the present and the past add to the intrigue and suspense. This book will remind readers of Gone Girl, but I found it to be much less darker and foreboding. "
269,Jasmine,"I absolutely LOVED this book. Goes to show...things aren't always what they seem....From the way the book was written, by date almost like a newspaper, was genius!I sometimes would flip back and forth to see what days corresponded with each character and what they were doing on a certain day in conjunction with someone else. The ending...lemme say...I didn't expect that. I didn't expect the culprit to be who it was. I will say, the character of Rachel was very relatable, yet bothersome. Only because she had allowed her ex husband to take her to such low depths, it just made me mad since I've seen that happen personally in my life and those around me. This felt me turning pages late into the evenings...then I'd have to remind myself I have to get up and go to work at 6:00am. This is for anyone who likes ""who dunnit?"" books and loves a good thriller/mystery. I didn't see the storyline moving like how it did. MUST READ FOR 2015!!!"
270,MrsCRobertson,"This was the kind of mystery/thriller that I couldn't put down. I loved how the author told the story from the perspective of the three main women involved. They each have a distinct voice and story that added to the depth and complexity of the book. The portrayal of the main character as an alcoholic was insightful and added not only to character development but to the overall plot development as well. She is flawed, she us pitiful, and yet her story is unfolding too. He ending wasn't a complete surprise, but only because the author raised my suspicions at just the right time to add to the suspense of he final outcome. Great book- I understand why this is one of the ""It"" books of the summer and why all of the local libraries have long waiting lists to check this out!!!"
271,Morgan Carattini,"I could NOT put this down! In fact, I read it in 2 days and it has been awhile since I have been so immersed in a book that I stayed up to the wee hours of the morning to finish it. I highly recommend for anyone who enjoys mystery/suspense. Hawkins writing is focused and propels you through the narrative. The characters are well developed-- I felt empathy for Rachel and Megan despite their destructive behavior. I also thought the changes in narrator add depth to the story, giving the reader an omniscient knowledge while also serving to further develop the characters. "
272,Kate Canan Rizzo,"Rachel is a mess. Once a happy, vivacious, gainfully employed woman, she now drinks to escape what her life has become. She now spends her days riding a train for no specific purpose other than to trick her flatmate, who believes she still has a job. Entranced in her made-up story of a couple she regularly watches at a regular stop, she sees something she shouldn't. And now the woman is missing.This is a brilliant, tension-filled book that is nearly impossible to put down. It is directly responsible for my students not getting their papers back on time. Read it!"
273,Holly Robinson,"For anyone who loves a plot that races around twisty bends so fast you're apt to get whiplash, THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN is for you. But the real beauty of this novel lies in the deft way the author writes characters you ought to hate, but root for anyway. For instance, one of the main characters, Rachel—she's the girl on the train—is such a lush that at one point she leaves her piss-soaked knickers in a heap at the bottom of the stairs and vomits as she's staggering up to her bedroom to pass out—leaving all of that stomach-churning evidence of her night's activities for her poor roommate to discover. Ew, right? Yet, Rachel is one of the most compelling characters I've come across in fiction lately, because she somehow keeps scrambling to her feet no matter how many times she's knocked down. There are two other female points of view in this novel that aren't any more likable, yet you end up hoping they manage to survive as well. Kudos to a very brave author who has given us a thrilling read that leads us into territory most writers fear to tread, for fear of alienating readers."
274,Lakshmi,"It's an interesting tale of intertwined lives of seemingly normal people. I particularly liked the way the author has woven the characters and the complications of each relationship. The empty, sorry and the pointless life of the protagonist Rachel is well depicted. The non linear story being told from the vantage point of various key characters is also impressive.As I read, the story kept getting interesting, it kept me guessing what Rachel would do next. It was unpredictable and very gripping. I will be keen to see the 70mm version of this story."
275,Jane Mccrimmon,"Excellent, I couldn't put this book down and read it in two days! At one point early in the story I had a thought about the twist, but got so engrossed in the sorry, that I forgot all about it. The riding on the train and peering out the window is something that everyone can related to. What is going on behind the windows o f the homes that we see every day. I will recommend this book to everyone. It is a great read, especially when sitting in a warm, toasty home or on a warm, hot beach. Read this one and be prepared not to move for a while, it is that engrossing."
276,Asude,"Birkaç dakika önce bitirdim. Muhteşemdi... Sıfır beklentiyle başlayın ve kitabın sizi çekmesine izin verin! Bu arada kitapta öyle hayran olacağınız türde karakterler yok, ben kriz bile geçirdim..."
277,Roua Naasan,"A totally compulsive, compelling, obsessive read, a real page turner. I COMPLETELY loved this book, well-paced, well-plotted, and the ending was everything but what I expected. I loved the suspicion, the longing to know who did this and who did that.. a mind blowing psychological thriller."
278,Isabelle Motta,"O livro conta a história em 3 pontos de vista. O da Rachel, uma mulher em torno dos 30 anos, divorciada e alcoólatra. O da Anna, uma mulher que acabou de ser mãe e que se casou com o ex-marido de Rachel. E o ponto de vista da Megan, uma mulher casada com Scott e que desapareceu. Rachel passa todo dia de trem na frente da casa de Megan e observa o casal, criando fantasias e histórias perfeitas para os dois em sua mente, até que um dia ela vê algo diferente pela janela do trem na casa de Megan. Depois que descobre que Megan desapareceu, ela começa a se envolver em sua procura. O livro foi maravilhoso, muito bem escrito e não achei arrastado. Todos os personagens do livro têm uma certa paranoia de perseguição. Achei interessante a presença do ponto de vista da Megan, escrito em um passado antes dela desaparecer. O culpado não é revelado em apenas uma página, de supetão. São descobertas feitas que levam à desconfiança e depois a saber que essa pessoa foi culpada, tudo desenvolvido em muitas páginas. Para mim foi uma surpresa a resolução do caso, pois durante o livro todo não pensei que o culpado era essa pessoa. Pensei que ia seguir um caminho de Garota Exemplar, mas não. Foi muito bom e recomendo."
279,Heidi Foster,"I really enjoyed this book. The author did a great job with the unreliable narrator, and I switched back and forth between feeling pity for her and being disgusted by her. The weak female characters bugged me a little but by the end of the book, made sense. This book is compared to Gone Girl because of the unreliable narrator, but I did not finish reading Gone Girl because it didn't hold my interest. Hawkins does a good job keeping you guessing for most of the book."
280,Erin Herndobler,Hitchcock meets Gone Girl. 
281,Allyce,"This is a great noir thriller. Grim, lonely, dark. Yes a lot like a Hitchcock film/Patricia Highsmith novel hybrid with some catty ""dark side of domesticity"" stuff thrown in. The women in this book are bedeviled with various ailments including alcoholism, depression, anxiety, toxic envy, codependency, and past trauma. I wont say more about how they end up in the same orbit. This book has been compared with Gone Girl but I object to that comparison both because the plots aren't actually that similar and since Hawkins has her own voice which is less descriptive than Flynn but more taught, direct and crisp which is what would have made this book a great black and white noir film ... Maybe best directed by a woman. I forget the name of the woman who directed ""in the cut"" but shed be a good choice. "
282,Paige,Well Shiiiiiiiiiit
283,Rosemary,Holy cow an excellent book. Even better when listened too. Bang up audio recording!!! Best one of 2015 so far. 
284,Julie McSorley,"
 I previewed a couple of pages first as the book was recommended as a 'if you liked Gone Girl' suggestion. And I loved Gone Girl, but loved this book even more. For a debut thriller Paula Hawkins made a great job of keeping me hooked. The characters and plot were brilliantly crafted. I'm not usually a fan of first person writing for all characters but it worked here and there's a great plot twist at the end which caught me totally off guard. Really looking forward to seeing what the author comes up with next and recommend to all crime enthusiasts."
285,Whitney Western,Great book! Very exciting and suspenseful. I love when the author covers the same event from different points of view. 
286,Klavy Usheva,Wow this book was as good as everyone had hyped it up to be! 
287,Kristina Alexandria,"I am not into psychological thriller that much (It scares the shit out of me! *chickeeeen!!*). So why I gave this book a go? First, I decided few months ago to read Sandra Brown’s Mean Streak w/c is a mystery thriller. And with all honesty, it’s kinda entertaining. Second - which is the very main reason - is because it topped The New York Times for the first week of February. So why not, right?This book is the creepiest book I ever read in my entire life of existence. Okay, maybe I’m quite exaggerating this, but seriously, it’s eerie. I finished reading it around 4 in the morning, and it absolutely gave me goose bumps!This book has three narrators: Anna Watson – the other woman, the lover; Megan Hipwel – the cheater who lived few doors away from Anna and Tom; and Rachel Watson – the alcoholic whose still can’t get over of her ex-husband’s infidelity, the girl who is always on the train. Anna and Rachel’s connection is obvious – Tom Watson. But how about Megan? Well, that’s where the creepiness started which will make you guessing the entire moment…and then will make you gasp and hold your breath once all secrets finally revealed.I just want to mention also, the author’s ability to REALLY play with her reader’s imagination is fuckin' superb! So if you want an exciting read, I recommend you to grab this one! "
288,Niki Stone,"“Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning and night. Every day she rattles down the track, flashes past a stretch of cozy suburban homes, and stops at the signal that allows her to daily watch the same couple breakfasting on their deck. She looks forward to it. She’s even started to feel like she knows them. Jess and Jason, she calls them. Their life-as she sees it-is perfect. Not unlike the life she recently lost.Until today and then she sees something shocking. It’s only a minute until the train moves on, but it’s enough. Now everything’s changed. Unable to keep it to herself, Rachel goes to the police.”Rachel once had the perfect life. Well, almost perfect. But she still had hope. Then she found out that her husband, Tom, had betrayed her with another woman. The blow was too much. She had to numb the pain, and alcohol did just that. Her drinking started early in the day as she rode on the commuter train to London each morning. She easily imagined the happiness of the beautiful couple that she could see on their deck through the train window, their loving caresses, his devotion, a life she could now only imagine. Rachel drank to oblivion but getting blind drunk didn’t help. Then came the black outs, and she started calling Tom, wanting him back, harassing him and his new wife. She hated his new wife, who had his baby, the baby she should have had. Then she hated herself for being a failure, which made her drink even more, to the point of forgetting her self-destructive and humiliating actions.Then, on her regular morning commute, Rachel saw something shocking from the train window. Jess, the beautiful girl on the deck, did the unthinkable. She allowed another man to take her in his arms and kiss her. Rachel couldn’t believe her eyes. Maybe she was in a drunken haze. No, it was true. Jess was cheating on Jason. How could she? Rachel’s dream was shattered, just like her own life had been shattered. Then came the real shocker. When Rachel was watching the news, she saw the face of a murdered young woman, whose name was Megan. Rachel realized it was the pretty girl on the deck, the one Rachel had named Jess. Megan looked even more beautiful than Rachel had imagined. Rachel knew she must go to the police and tell them about the other man. Maybe he was somehow tied to the murder. But would they believe her? How could they since she was rarely sober. A murder, a red haired stranger on the train, the mystery man on the deck, Rachel’s blackouts, all blend into an intense psychological thriller that will keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat to the very end. "
289,Pamela / SpazP,I listened to this and COULD NOT STOP LISTENING. No info dumps or unnecessary descriptions - FANTASTIC written and audio narration! HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE AUDIOBOOK!!!!
290,Violaine,"I really enjoyed this book and I really wanted to know what happened at the end. There are still some questions for me at the end - things I did not quite understand, details that don't seem to quite add up, but overall it was an excellent read. It was everything you'd expect from a thriller - great suspense, good characters, great twists. I was worried at the start that the book would get confusing with three different narrators talking at different times, but it was surprisingly easy to follow. I liked the main narrator, Rachel, the most. She's highly unreliable but I found her quite touching with all her issues. The writing was also pleasant to read and felt honest and true - I could relate to the characters, even the darkest ones. "
291,Chanda2426,"Carve out some extra time for this wildly compulsive read! Hawkins is a wonderful author whose unreliable narrators will have you guessing whodunit to the very end. I couldn't put this novel down for long. Written in the vain of Gone Girl, this book is destined to be talked about by everyone in the coming months. I will definitely read Hawkins again."
292,Pete,"THEY ARE WHO WE THOUGHT THEY WERE!!-Dennis GreenIs this a quick read? Is the writing simple? Is there a soap opera-esk feel? Is the main character an annoying mess? Yes. But those aren't bad things in this case. All those things add to the story. It's supposed to feel that way. These things fall in line with the plot that is mainly told in the mind of a lonely alcoholic.The structure of the story was super fun. When the main character, Rachael, gets blackout drunk (which happens often) there are huge gaps in time where nobody knows what happened in the story. Dude, where's my car? Rachael then has to try to fill in the gaps.This was a lot of fun. Some say it was predictable. I disagree. I had many suspects up until the point when Hawkins drops the key hint as to what Megan (the missing girl Rachael watches from her daily train rides) is up to.This book has a female author and it's a crime/mystery. That is where the similarities end between this and Gone Girl. Flynn is a straight up badass writer who I'm down for whatever she writes. Hawkins executed a great, original idea and I hope she has future tricks in her bag, but I'm not sure. Regardless, read this.Side Note: I want a six pack of canned Gin & Tonic for tailgating. Bravo England."
293,Yakoytroy,Me ha gustado mucho. Sin duda lo recomiendo . 
294,Jeff Bonasse,"A fantastic mystery storyHonestly this is not what I expected when I bought this book. I expected a mystery but not one with a story so muddled by the memory of the sole witness. It took me longer than usual to figure out who had done it. Well written characters, no true heroes."
295,Libby Chester,"The story reads like something that could happen'The Girl On The Train' is a great whodoneit suspense laden thriller. The novel is filled with flawed characters who are so believable you can smell the alcoholic fumes coming off of protagonist Rachel. Riding the train into London everyday so her flatmate Cathy won't realize she no longer has a job, Rachel creates a fantasy world (life) for a couple who live a few houses down the street from Rachel's ex-husband Tom and new wife Anna. Rachel calls the couple Jason and Jess. One day Rachel sees something, from the train window, that thrusts the perfectly imagined lives of Jason and Jess into stark reality. What I love best about this book is that the characters feel like someone you could know; the story reads like something that could happen. There were points where I was unsure what was going to happen next with the suspense building to breathe holding pitch but in the end leading to a conclusion that was credible. You know that little sad feeling you get at the end of the book because it's all said and done and you have to pick yourself up just like the girl on the train and get back to real life. I'm already missing Rachel. I suppose she's a bit of an anti-hero, or at the least unlikely...."
296,Maria Bolin, What a roller coaster!!! I thoroughly enjoyed the ride!! At one point I thought it might just be a drunken women's imaginary reality. Wow!!!!
297,Brian Denning,A MUST-READ! So suspenseful at the end I had to put it down a couple of times! 
298,Anne,"I had mixed feelings about this book. The start made me feel quite angry towards Rachel, I thought the woman was loopy to say the least but as the story continued I started to slowly feel sorry for her, mainly because I could see how she was being manipulated by the people around her. That does not mean that she was entirely blameless! I felt sorry for Anna at the start, mainly because I felt that the situation she was in was not completely of her own doing but, that changes as you read on. Again I realised that all was not as it seemed, Anna could be accused of bringing some of what was happening on herself and at times I thought she was very cold hearted. I actually enjoyed this book, the ending could have been better but actually there was no where else for the story to go and I was gripped from about halfway through until the end. If you liked Gone Girl or whodunnits then this is the book for you, a great holiday read."
299,Daryl,"A First Reads win! I really enjoyed this book, wanting to read through it quickly, and not wanting to put it down, as the cliche goes. Rachel Watson rides the train into London every day. She frequently notices a couple on the terrace of their home in a suburban sub-division and starts to make up stories about them. One day she sees a different man there with the woman, and the next day, the woman disappears. I don't want to say any more about the plot, as the novel makes a few interesting twists and turns along the way. Hawkins switches back and forth between three different narrators, two in the present, and one a year or so in the past. (And, yeah, the Gone Girl comparisons weren't lost on me, but this isn't a rip-off of that novel.) I liked the switching back and forth in narrators, and wasn't ever exactly sure which, if any, of them could be fully trusted. Hawkins uses this to keep up the mystery. (Rachel, for example, is a full-on alcoholic, who suffers blackouts and can't always remember what happened to her.) This was a fun read, even though the big reveal of the guilty party could be seen coming (I figured out who it was a bit before it's revealed). Still, it was interesting, well-written, and lots of fun."
300,Anna,"No wonder this one is so popular. It is riveting and well paced. I planned to read a couple of chapters, and read it cover to cover in one evening."
301,Heather Rowland,"The characters are messy and out of control, but in a realistic way. I had a little trouble getting into it because it felt slow, but as the intensity started to build, and the violence increased, it got me hooked and I didn't want to put it down. I didn't see the ending coming which I like."
302,Hayley Townsend,"This book is impossible to put down! I spent too many hours reading it because I just had to find out ""who done it!"" It is a dark thriller with a complicated main character who we are not sure if we can trust. However, this unreliable narrator aspect is part of the intrigue with this book. You are just as informed as our main character, who is often drunk and unsure about everything, but you also get to read from other characters' perspectives which can be really interesting. The voyeuristic quality of this book is very interesting in that you are immediately swept into this world where you are often look through a small train window or the blurred eyes of a drunk, observing and analyzing with the narrator. It's the perfect mystery."
303,Marilisa,"Bello bello bello... Sicuramente vi verrà da ridere, ma questo è stato il primo libro del genere thriller. Ho sempre voluto leggere sto gente ma non n'è ho mai avuto l'occasione .Bando alle ciance.... Ora parliamo del libro.Per quanto riguarda il tipo di narrazzione : è stata semplice, chiara ma mai banale, sono stati usati termini semplici e concisi per non distrarre troppo il lettore dalla parte più importante, la storia. La storia è stata costruita in maniera perfetta , facendo crescere le aspettative man mano che si andava avanti , ma fermandosi anche ad analizzare particolari o personaggi che magari solo alla fine del libro se n'è capito il senso. Una lettura tutta di un fiato... Consiglio al 100% questo libro , un gran bel debutto."
304,Brent Doria,"Wow! It has been a long time that I could just sit and read a book all the way through in two days but this was worth it. It reminded me of why I've always liked as a source of escaping. I felt very involved with all the characters. I don't want to give away too much so I will be brief. Rachel, has issues. She is a drunk, she is obsessed with her ex husband, and has lost her job. Every day she pretends to go to work so that her roommate doesn't ask questions, and takes the train into town. Each day on the train she passes her old neighborhood,where her ex husband still lives with his new wife and child (which is a whole other form of dysfunction). A few doors down is a couple that she only sees from the train, who she refers to as Jason and Jess. They seem to be the perfect couple based on what Rachel sees from the train. They're always lovey dovey on the patio and reading the paper and drinking coffee together. One day Rachel goes by and notices that ""Jess"" is outside with a new man. The day after that Rachel sees ""Jess's"" face on the news and that she has come up missing. Rachel thinks she can help, but due to her instability and own regrettable past, and not even knowing the missing girl, Rachel comes off as an unreliable witness. I will stop there but highly suggest that you read this! I hope Hawkins writes more, and soon!"
305,Pushkar Kulkarni,"""One for sorrow, two for joy, three for girl. Three for girl. I am stuck at three!""Remember when you watched Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream? Remember how you couldnt stop yourself from feeling sorry for the characters even though you knew things are going to be bad on their heroine and drug fueled path and none of this is good? That was one true example of a sheer genius of moving picture where everything just hit the most darkest corners of your mindset and it became impossible to get it out of your thoughts for days. Now imagine the same feeling stretched across 300 pages with psychological twists and turns so dense that you will actually find yourself thinking about these messed up people hours, maybe days, after you put the book down. The Girl on the Train is one powerful mystery thriller novel which mostly revolves around the darker shade of grey when it comes to good and bad. The novel is written with the perspective of three ladies; a drunk, a liar and a cheat (Talk about the charming leads, huh!). The alcoholic who is not sure of the reality and her imagination. The liar who's entire idea of happiness is based on ignorance. And the cheat who only has her emotional fragility and depression to get closure from her loved ones. These shady characters make you question your own judgement of them as none of them is righteous and none of their actions are justifiable. Hawkins develops them with such a great precision that you will find yourself resenting them on one page and rooting for them on the other. What makes this read more intriguing is Hawkins narrative style where the events are described from the perception of only these three central characters than a third person point of view adding more layers into their personality. Readers familiar with Gillian Flynn's can totally find many parallels with Sharp Objects and Gone Girl. For me, its surely better and importantly more paced than the mentioned novels. Go read it asap and then bury it into your furthest corner only to revisit Rachel, Anna and Meagan into your nightmares, just like your own regrets."
306,⚔ Ashley ⚔,"OH. MY. LANTA. I am soooo glad the hype of this book lived up to my expectations! I am skeptical to read books that it seems everyone raves about, because about 50 percent of the time, I am disappointed. The hype overshadows the actual story, and at the end I'm left all ""Seriously?"" But thank the book gods, The Girl on the Train was one hell of a ride. How much of what we see of someone's relationship is reality?What gets hidden behind locked doors and drawn shades?How well do we really know anyone?An alcoholic, a liar, and a cheat. Which one do you trust?This unsettling journey is told through three POVs: Rachel, Megan, and Anna. Rachel takes the train to and from London every day, getting a glimpse into the lives of those who reside near the tracks. She makes up stories about them, she gives them names, character traits, backgrounds; she creates a whole, perfect life for them in her head. Then one day, she sees something disturbing happen between ""Jason and Jess"" – a couple she has become obsessed with. When that small incident evolves into something larger, and much more serious, Rachel finds herself smack in the middle of something she has no business being a part of – after all, she is just the girl on the train.

""There's something comforting about the sight of strangers safe at home.""

 Whoa. This was crazy good, you guys. I can't really say much about the plot, because it really is a story you just have to experience for yourself. It's mysterious, gritty, deceiving, and utterly tantalizing; it is everything I want in a psychological thriller. I found myself completely enthralled with this story line. Every spare second I had, my nose was buried in this book. My mind was constantly whirring, putting together scenario after scenario, trying to figure out the answers, and just when I thought I had Sherlocked the case, Paula Hawkins threw another twist my way that sent me back to square one. The characters are all horribly flawed, they all have secrets. I think it's a true testament of a great author when they can make every, single main character unlikable in some way and still keep you invested in the story. 

""I have never understood how people can blithely disregard the damage they do by following their heart.""

I have seen a lot of people comparing it to Gone Girl, but I don't know how much I really agree with that. I know why the comparisons are being made, and as great as The Girl on the Train is, I don't think it holds a candle to Gone Girl. (Just my opinion, of course). That being said, if you like Gillian Flynn's novels or just want a chilling page-turner that will keep you guessing literally right up until the very end, this is your book. Read it and read it now."
307,Daniel Falconer,"5/5 - It's been a long while since I finished a book in a single day, but I couldn't leave this for more than an hour without picking it up again. Great reinvention of the thriller genre. Must read!"
308,Dany A.a,"""Life is not a paragpraph, and death is no paranthesis.""4.5/5The writing was very beautiful it had such an edge to it, very very engrossing. I read this in about 3 sittings and each of them were very long. I just couldn't put it down once I got into it.The story itself was kind of crazy at times, it pushed every character's true colors out, which I really liked. It was easy for me to determine who I liked(Rachel,Kamal,Cathy) and loathed(Anna, Megan,Riley) Although it took quite a time to feel connected to the main character, I did enjoy her povs as well as megans. It was a nice change every once in a while.Also the themes this book explored were very dangerous and Hawkins did a perfect job in truly grasping those themes in a raw emotional way.I couldn't stand Anna at all but I liked how she stopped the denial at the end and just jammed the corkscrew to move on.I feel like the ending is insufficient, It didnt come as much of a shock because I did predict it. I would have liked an epilogue.It was very enjoyable overall!"
309,Francine Abel,"I loved this thriller, could not put it down. If I could give it 6 stars, I would :-)"
310,Kate Jessop,"For a book about a girl on a train, Paula Hawkin's novel certainly is a fast-paced rollercoaster ride of a whodunnit. I picked this book up late one evening and stayed up past 2am reading it. I simply couldn't put it down. Much like ""Gone Girl"" the main characters have very few redeeming qualities. However, I felt more invested in Rachel Watson--a divorcee alcoholic who has lost not only her marriage to the bottle, but also her job, her confidence, and her motivation for anything but her next drink--than I felt in ""Gone Girl""'s similarly flawed Nick or Amy Dunne. On her daily commute to London, Rachel sees the same couple, whom she affectionately dubs Jess and Jason, and pictures what their fairy tale life is like from her seat on the train. But her belief in their perfect life comes crashing down when she witnesses ""Jess"" kissing another man. Outraged by this reminder of her own ex-husband's affair, Rachel is determined to set things right by telling Jason about his wife's cheating. But things are turned upside down when ""Jess,"" really Megan Hippwell, is reported missing. Filled with a new sense of purpose, Rachel insinuates herself into the investigation and Jason--Scott Hippwell's--life. It should have been painful to watch a woman with so little dignity, and who is even deemed an unreliable witness by the police, stumble around drunk as she pitifully scrambles to find a sense of importance in any way she can. At times, I mentally groaned as Rachel made yet another huge blunder, calling her ex-husband yet again, showing up at his house, pretending she still had a job, making false claims about a friendship with Megan, lying to her flatmate about joining AA--was there anything this woman could do right? A more fitting title for the novel could even have been ""Trainwreck Girl."" However, through all of these mistakes and glimpses of who Rachel used to be, I couldn't help but to root for her to somehow pull it together.However that seems less likely than ever, when Megan's body is found and Scott becomes suspect #1, and Rachel finds herself irretrievably involved in an increasingly dangerous situation. As she struggles to piece together the drunken events of the night Megan disappeared, she realizes that she may have witnessed more than what she had seen from her view on the train. Like Rachel, I could't imagine who was responsible for Megan's murder, even with the benefit of glimpses into the adulterous woman's point of view. ""Girl on the Train"" kept me guessing almost to the very end and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a fast-paced mystery with complex and human characters."
311,Helen Deakin,What an exciting read. Paula Hawkins is a very talented writer. I was extremely engrossed in this book and once I got about half way through I found it rather difficult to put down. I must say I had the ending pegged from about somewhere in the middle of the book but the story was so well written and the outcome so cleverly disguised I think that most people would be kept guessing. Exceptional characters that make you emotionally attached to them and all round a great read. 5 stars well earned!
312,CJ Browne,"I loved the opening. Girl on train looks out of window on her regular commute to work and imagines what the people who live in the houses she passes are like. Something I’ve done myself and I’m sure other readers have too.The story is told from the viewpoint of Rachel, the girl on the train, and reads like a diary entry, alternating with Megan, the girl who lives in the house Rachel watches and where she herself lived until her marriage broke up. We get to understand Rachel’s sadness and frustration with her current life. Megan’s seems so much more exciting with the handsome partner, often seen drinking wine and lovingly caressing her in the garden that used to be hers. Both Rachel and Megan have unlikable thoughts and behavior. Rachel drinks too much and often forgets what she’s said and done. A characteristic that becomes more important as the plot develops. Megan has a guilty secret and seems unable to commit to a relationship.The chapters of ‘The Girl on the Train’ are short and compelling. The alternate point of view and uneven timelines work well, adding to the tension as Rachel gets more caught up in Megan’s life and as a reader you wonder just how much you can trust her. The characters are extremely well drawn, especially the women, and the red herrings are skillfully placed. Overall this is a satisfying read and I can’t wait to see how the film version pans out."
313,Ana Maria,"Cuando alguien te observa y tu no te das cuenta... Puedes ser tan transparente que se hacen historias alrededor tuyo. La vida de 3 chicas y su relacion con esposos, novios, amantes y maestros... Que bonita familia."
314,Emma Costamagna,"All’inizio, la lettura è lenta, come un treno in partenza, però, dopo i primi sferragliamenti, prende velocità: l’ho letto in una sera fino a pag. 62, e poi l’ho lasciato sul comodino per circa un mese, come se fosse una bottiglia di vino che doveva decantare. Quello che mi ha colpito di questo romanzo è la sua struttura narrativa: mi sono sempre piaciuti i racconti a più voci e qui sono tre le voci narranti principali. Rachel, la protagonista, è alcolizzata e depressa. È disoccupata, ma non ha il coraggio di confessarlo alla sua coinquilina, così, ogni giorno prendere il treno per Londra. È questo il momento della giornata che preferisce, quando può fantasticare sulla vita delle altre persone, distogliendo l’attenzione dai propri fallimenti. In particolare, le piace spiare una coppia, un uomo e una donna, senza nome, che ogni mattina fanno colazione in veranda. Per lei sono Jess e Jessie e la loro vita è un riflesso di quella che aveva con Tom prima dell’arrivo di Anna. Anna è l’altra, la donna che ha soppiantato Rachel nel cuore di Tom e che gli ha donato una figlia. Infine, c’è Megan, la nuova vicina di casa di Anna e che, dopo aver perso il lavoro presso una galleria d’arte sarà per un breve periodo di tempo la baby sitter della figlia di Anna e Tom e che è sempre alla ricerca dell’altro al di fuori del matrimonio.Il carattere di queste tre donne è stato tratteggiato così bene dalla Hawkins da renderle quasi reali, con i loro pregi e i loro difetti, tanto da rendere quasi impossibile parteggiare per una o per l’altra. Se all’inizio, il comportamento di Rachel nei confronti dell’ex marito e della sua nuova compagna può essere riprovevole, man mano che si prosegue nella lettura, si capisce che la realtà non è mai come appare, così come non lo è la vita di Megan e di suo marito."
315,Hildegard,4.5 stars
316,Hana Gashi,SPOILER ALERT!!!just kidding Lirim.Brilliant! oh my... Brilliiiiiant!
317,Roberto Garcia,"This is not my typical type of book, but I liked it a lot. It is very well written, with incredible words, an amazing pace and smooth to read.The story pulls you page by page towards the story, immerses you with the scenario and the characters, slowly giving us account of this fucked up world and the hardships of human relationships with the lies that lay beneath the surface of every interaction in this society.Rachel is a very complex and disturbed character, but I like it a lot, she made me feel vulnerable and exposed my own drunkenness right in the face with her own behavior. Megan remained me in some ways of my teenage years, when life was “easy” and at the same time full of darkness and complex decisions that affect the years to come; I met some crazy unsecure girls on those years and she made me think of them and their “new selves” today… did they really changed? Anna is the common “I’ll go with the flow” girl that never thinks of the consequences, she was my least favorite. Paula Hawkins debut amazed me in many ways because it really puts your own thoughts and beliefs at stake… should we go trusting everything the “others” say, do, sell, project? I think in some way this book exposes and questions our own relationships and their development over the years.Strong recommendation is you like strong stories that will shake the ground you walk by, with low moral unsecure characters that if they do not depress you, they will show you the very essence of the XXI century breakdown in society so you can learn something and maybe consider it for your own story.Many thanks Paula, please write us another thriller soon…"
318,Dannalie Diaz,"I love a good thriller, especially when the narrator is completely unreliable. 3 narrators, one of them the victim, all built in with their own set of issues that make you question whether their point of view is actually the best one. I figured out the twist about 50 pages before the end, but still enjoyed every last page of this book. Definitely understand the hype, and would LOVE to see this on the big screen."
319,Adri G,"To call this book 'the next Gone Girl' is to do both books and both authors a disservice.I enjoy Flynn's work very much, having read every book she has published thus far. Dark Places remains my personal favourite; THAT is a movie I'll brave the theatre to see. That said, I'm not looking for another Gone Girl.Read it, liked it, carried on. It stands on its own merit and is a great read. As is this book. I've not encountered this author before but am looking forward to discovering more of her work. I found this story to be highly entertaining, although it took me a bit of perseverance to get far enough in to be hooked. Hawkins has a knack for creating utterly reprehensible yet realistic characters.I can't really claim to have any affection for anyone in this book; I did, however, become invested in what happened to the protagonist, hot mess though she may be. In any case: this book is worth a read, even if you've already tried it and given it up early on. Go back and try again; it picks up remarkably and evolves into a page-turner quite quickly. What on earth should I read next..."
320,Melissa Martin,"Where do I even begin about this book! I loved it of course as I have rated it 5 stars. This was a complex journey through the lives of people that seem so normal from the outside. But things are never what they seem. THERE WILL BE SOME SPOILERS AFTER THIS POINT!!! The book is told through three different lives: Rachel, Megan and Anna. Rachel seems to be the alcoholic loser that can't get over her husband Tom leaving her. I feel very sorry for Rachel. All she wanted was to have a child with her husband. Because she wasn't able to conceive she went into a deep depression which turned her into an alcoholic. Her husband Tom was an a..hole who wouldn't help her in any way. He could have tried all kinds of counseling with her, but he leaves her. Of course this doesn't help with her drinking. She is just a sad person living with a woman named Cathy and trying to get by. She just can't cope over not having a child and losing her husband. It's been two years and she's just lost and drinking so much that she loses her job. But instead of telling Cathy this, she still rides the train every morning and evening, pretending she still has a job. This train just happens to go by her old house and she watches her ex husband with his new wife and baby. She also watches another couple a few houses down. She makes up names for them and dreams of their perfect life. It's a little bizarre, but so is life. The name of the couple in the house down from Rachel's old house is Megan and Scott. They are not the happy couple Rachel dreams they are. Megan is not happy with Scott and is having an affair. Scott is a bit of a control freak and scary. Rachel is always calling her ex trying to get him to come back to her. She shows up at their house sometimes. Just crazy things she does when she is drunk. One night she goes out there to see him but is so drunk she can't remember much of anything that happened. She knows she finds her way home with blood on her and that a man helped her up when she fell to the ground. She finds out the next day that Megan is missing. This takes us on a wild ride of Rachel trying to find out what happened to Megan. She was there that night where Megan was last seen. She wonders if she did something to her or if she saw someone that did. She blacked out and can't remember much at all. Rachel gets caught up in trying to find out this mystery. She stops calling and bothering her ex husband Tom as much since she's got something else to worry about. This makes Anna, Tom's wife, happier but she still has stress and hatred for Rachel. I have to say I didn't like Anna at all through the whole book! I thought she was a horrible person. When finding out she was having an affair with Rachel's husband the whole time just confirmed it. Then she eventually marries him. But not all is wonderful in this little world of people. Rachel befriends Megan's husband Scott trying to find out what is going on and help him with his pain. She told him Megan was seeing another man, her therapist. She's trying to keep the police from thinking he did it. The whole book has you wondering if Rachel might have killed Megan thinking she was Anna since they look similar in appearance. But then things start to fall into place and it's a dramatic ending that I didn't see coming. I loved the ending. I just loved it. Justice was done for all involved, in a sense. I loved this book and I hope to read more from this author. She did an awesome job! www.melissa413readsalot.blogspot.com"
321,Craig Faustus Buck,"Though I saw the ending coming a mile away, I thought her interwoven first-person structure and rich character development was five-star all the way. An engrossing, dark, delightful read."
322,Patricia Atkinson,loved the book told from 3 different women s the story of Rachael and her drinking problems who loses her husband to another women anna than loses her job. she is afraid to tell her flat mate about her job so she continues to take the train every day...when a women named megan comes up missing she knows who she is she seen her everyday from the train but the day before she seen a man kiss her but it wasn't her husband...because of her drinking the police feel she is not a reliable witness.racheal remembers something but is confused by her drinking and and wonders what is real and what she dreamed....fast paced book and has twists you think you figured it out but than it catches wondering again..........
323,Caleb,All girls are crazy but some guys are really crazy
324,Beka Willison,"Utterly enticing!! I thoroughly enjoyed the writing style, character development and plot! Simply Marvelous!!"
325,Debbie,"This book kept me guessing the whole time and I love that. It's dark like Gone Girl and I didn't really like any of the narrators but the characters are fleshed out so well that I didn't even mind that. The main narrator is Rachel-a divorced alcoholic who rides the train everyday so that her roommate doesn't know that she lost her job. She fantasizes about a couple that she sees every day from the train. When the woman turns up missing, she gets way too involved. The three narrators are all fairly unreliable and there are a few red herrings to throw you off track. I was left guessing for most of the book who the ""bad guy"" is and the final scenes are doozies!"
326,Tracym,"A brilliant must read, a definite page turner that left you wanting more each time you read. A brilliant ending for a brilliant book. "
327,Nan,"Son raros los libros que hacen sentir nervioso al lector por lo que está por venir, por lo que los personajes van a decir, a hacer. Pues este libro es uno de esos. Al principio me costó trabajo agarrarle el hilo a la historia y no terminaba de convencerme, pero de pronto algo mágico pasó, me atrapó y no me dejó salir hasta que terminé. La novela está contada desde tres mujeres diferentes, lo cual me confundió un poco cuando comencé la lectura. Sin embargo, resulta muy interesante cómo se van desenvolviendo, interactuando entre ellos y revelando paulatinamente el misterio, que al final me resultó inesperado. Los personajes padecen una serie de trastornos que van desde la paranoia, el alcoholismo, los delirios -entre otros trastornos de la personalidad, y que vale la pena analizar desde el punto de vista psicológico-, que los llevan a cometer actos que no les voy a contar, para que lo lean, pero que me mantuvieron muy atento por días. Aunque el personaje principal es más bien algo que nadie querría ser, la autora es tan buena que uno se llega a identificar con ella y sus disparates. Por algo este fue uno de los libros más vendidos de 2015 a nivel mundial y ganó el premio a mejor libro de misterio de ese año, aunque es la obra debut de Paula Hawkins. Así que si lo ven en la librería, les aconsejo que lo compren: a mí me ha gustado."
328,Peg,"I looked forward to this novel and I was not disappointed. It held my interest throughout and had many twists and turns. For her debut novel, the author has written a thriller set in suburban London. Its protagonist, Rachel, is a very troubled, alcoholic train commuter who becomes familiar with the routines of people she watches daily along her route.The chapters are alternating viewpoints of Rachel and two of the other main female characters. This is a novel I didn't want to put down. It was so suspenseful, I had no idea what would be happening next. It's impossible to discuss the plot without giving something away so I will say that I highly recommend it and give it 5 Stars!"
329,Sarah Natt,"I loved this book, the characters and suspense. Loved it. "
330,Katie Tillwick,"Amazing!! So intense, I HAD to give myself breaks!"
331,Marny Danneberg,One of the best books I've read in a long time!
332,Lucie Fornasiero,Loved it! Page turner. 
333,Anand Patel,Its a good book. Its like reading a movie. Plot is good & it will hook you up til the end. Enjoy reading
334,Krystn,"This book rocked my world. In addition to being a captivating psychological thriller who-dunnit, that I couldn't put down, it reminds us of one of life's most important lessons: don't listen to what others tell you about a situation or a person, use your own judgement. Don't doubt yourself. If you spend time alone and believe in yourself, listening to your own voice, you will see exactly what is in front of you. Not the blurry falsehood that someone with their own agenda wants you to see. Great lines in the book: The workings of other people's families are always so impenetrable. The holes in your life are permanent. You have to grow around them, like tree roots around concrete; you mold yourself through the gaps. "
335,Lizzet Rojas,"If you're getting into the thriller/mystery genre, this is a great book to start with. A bit slow at first as it introduces characters, but once the disappearance mystery is introduced it really pulled me in. The characters are all flawed, and some have very negative traits, but as the book goes on you begin to get more of their background story and start to either have more empathy for them or find them even more repulsive. The complex nature of these characters adds to the depth of the story, so it’s a great book that challenges the reader to question the way they view people and human behavior in general. The different perspectives and time jumps also provide another layer and allows the reader to view the same situations differently, plus it also serves as a writing tool that helps the author tie everything together at the end."
336, wade, Very absorbing story about a young lady who travels the same route by train twice a day and starts to observe some things that interest and later alarm about a young couple whose home she passes. Her life is complicated by blackouts caused by alcohol abuse which cause her over the course of the novel to forget and question things that she sees. Ultimately a young lady is murdered and the heroine throws herself into the solving of this murder. I don't want to give too much away but it is a real page turner well worth your time. 
337,Vicky-Leigh Sayer,"The Girl On The Train is a novel I've been hearing a lot about recently, after reading it, I think its safe to say we will probably all be heaing a lot more about it.The Girl On The Train is a thriller of the highest quality. Paula Hawkins writes excellently and you certainly wouldn't recognise this novel as a debut.Rachel 'The girl on the train' is a character only the extremely hard hearted wouldn't feel sorry for. Lonely, unemployed, depressed and an alcoholic, Rachel seeks comfort in her daily 'commute' to work (so that her flatmate doesn't know she lost her job) where she makes up stories about the houses and strangers she sees - who doesn't?!One day she sees one of her regular 'friends' kissing a man who isn't her husband. Rachel feels saddened and angry by this. Although she doesn't know the couple that inhabit the house, only two doors down from where she used to live, she feels that she does, and she doesn't understand why someone would be so stupid as to to flaunt their dirty laundry in public.As with most thrillers, things are not what they seem, and Rachel is not the only woman keeping secrets from her family and friends. When the woman goes missing sparking a massive man hunt, Rachel feels compelled to tell the Police what she saw, but will they believe an alcoholic prone to black outs? Or will Rachel find herself in more trouble that she could ever imagine?The Girl On The Train is a novel told not just from Rachel's perspective but also that of two other women, but to tell you about them, would give a little more away about the plot than I would wish to. I want you all to read this amazing debut for yourselves!"
338,Joey LaBelle,"Wow. Nothing short of amazing. Every review you read says ""Gone Girl this"" and ""Gone Girl that"", but this book stands on it's own as an amazing piece of work. Yes, it has a similar storyline to that of Gone Girl, but it shouldn't deter you from reading it. I kept seeing it come up in my Recommended list, and always browsed past it. Now I want to read it again... Yeah, this is one of those books that reads one way the first time, then once you know the outcome, the entire book will feel new again and you can pick up on little things during a second read that you may have missed the first time around.If you read at all, you MUST grab this book. Five stars. Would recommend it to anyone that can magically turn chunks of letters into words. READ IT. READ IT NOW."
339,Hotchypotch  ,"I am always a bit cautious when I see nothing but great reviews about a book – Will it be so hyped that I will expect too much, only to be disappointed when I put my own eyes on the written word? I put my name on the library waiting list facing months before I can borrow it. Then comes a colleague, with whom I discuss and recommend books: “Read this! Read this” and he let me borrow his copy.The Girl in the Train by Paula HawkinsIn the Hitchcock movie Rear Window, Jimmie Stewart was watching tenants in the other building from his apartment sitting in his wheelchair as he has nothing else to do while recovering from an accident.Change the scenery to a London train, where Rachel on her daily commutes between home and work, passes a house, where a couple lives. She notices the house every day and imagines the names and lives of the couple.One day Rachel has a fallout with her ex-husband Tomas and his new wife Anna, while being drunk in the same area as the house, she watches from the train. She is so drunk that she has a blackout and therefore a hard time piecing events together afterwards.It happens to be the same day where Megan is reported missing – the lady from the house she watches. Suddenly she remembers that she has observed something different at the house while passing it and shares it with the police. Sadly, her reputation as a drunk precedes her and she is not being taken seriously as the police discovers that her life is not what people believe it to be.When I noticed the initial resemblance with one of my favorite Hitchcock movies I was doubted the success of the book. That was until the event of the book sucked me inside so I would not let go of the book until the last page turned. I totally get the hype about this book. READ IT"
340,Clayton Brannon,I enjoyed this quick and easy read. The format of the story really makes you concentrate on the details. Well written and extremely entertaining. 
341,Karla Jay,"A book that creates such controversy as to whether it's like Gone Girl or not always makes me interested in checking it out. In not comparing this book to any other out there, I found The Girl on the Train to be a page-turner and I spent too many nights staying up too late to get through more of it.What appealed to me most was the fresh story idea—what we see from a monotonous train ride each day can change your life in extraordinary ways, if you get involved, if there's deceit. We should all be so lucky to put out a debut novel that generates this kind of attention! Great job, Paula Hawkins."
342,C.A.,Holy mind fuck batman! I was captivated from start to finish! This is a book you don't want to miss out on...definitely read it!
343,DeadGirl Drama,"In a debut novel from Paula Hawkins writing under her own name, The Girl on the Train is an incredibly woven, suspenseful and unique tale of psychological mystery. The novel is about Rachel, a recent divorcee with a penchant for drowning her depression in alcohol and who can’t seem to get beyond her haunting past.The story is told from the separate perspectives of both Rachel and Megan, a recently murdered woman, who are connected by random events that never brought the women together during Megan’s life, but left them inseparable after Megan’s death. I especially enjoyed this novel because there were many striking aspects with which I was able to relate, given some of my recent life experiences, and I felt myself quite in tune with the hardship Rachel is going through. Rachel is drowning in failure, heartache, depression, shame, financial hardship and her paramount weakness, alcohol.But what makes the novel so truly incredible is the complexity of the tale, its unusual circumstances and the tapestry Paula Hawkins creates in developing a mysterious tragedy of heartache and deceit that rivals any I’ve previously read.This book is a definite must-read, but get yourself ready for a roller-coaster ride of a story!"
344,Christine Hayton,"The Girl on the Train"" is the first book I've read, in a very long time, that has lived up to its hype. This is an engaging and entertaining story, well written, and perfectly paced. The emotional involvement with the characters is unavoidable - a dark thriller that is hard to put down."
345,Kdunbier,"Hmmm. I have a lot of thoughts. First off, you know I LOVE an unreliable narrator, and Rachel reminds me most of the narrator of A Kind of Intimacy by Jenn Ashworth. These books actually have many similarities (domestic suspense, unlikable and unreliable female narrators, unrequited love/desperation, British-ness!). Which brings me to another point -- this book is not any better than Jenn Ashworth, or many other British mysteries I have read -- Sophie Hannah jumps to mind. And it is not as good as Tana French, Denise Mina, or Kate Atkinson, as contemporary exemplars of this genre. So I'm not sure why this book has received such a hard marketing push, unless it is just all about finding the next Gone Girl. That said, I did enjoy the book very much. I did indeed read it ""compulsively,"" as they say. It sucks you right in with enough twists and drama to keep you involved in what is ultimately a novel of narrators rather than action. The split narration and timelines are effective. Its all well crafted. There are some heights for the writing -- Rachel's Sylvia Plath comparison is particularly effective and memorable. Tom's character is well drawn -- as a woman who attracts men who are attracted to damage, I definitely know that type. The groundwork prepares you for a final third that could seem way ott in another novel. I found Megan's passages to be the most chilling -- her recounting the death of her child was haunting and brutal. Again, lay the right groundwork for the emotional fireworks of the final third. The relationships were well drawn and identifiable -- I felt viscerally for Rachel in the scene where she and Tom meet in the car and she thinks there might be another chance... who doesn't recognize that feeling??So! Does it do anything new? No! Does it do all the old cliches very well? Absolutely!"
346,Lindsey,"Whew, what a wild and crazy ride. Similar to Gone Girl; if you like dark murder mystery character studies it's definitely worth a read. "
347,Melissa Taft,"Loved it! It definitely held my interest, even though a few characters seemed obnoxious. "
348,Jerrilynn Lilyblade,Good thriller that keeps you reading way past your bedtime 
349,Veronica,"Quando mi sono avvicinata agli psycho-thriller (nel mio caso ho iniziato con ""L'attesa"" di Samantha Hayes) sono rimasta subito intrigata dalle trame e dal fatto che era impossibile capire se quello che leggevi era vero o meno, visto che spesso i narratori sono inattendibili a causa dei loro problemi psicologici. Dopo aver letto ""l'attesa"" e aver trovato un sacco di incongruenze con la ""rivelazione"" sono rimasta delusa, chiedendomi se non fosse il problema di tutti i libri del genere, ma non mi sono arresa, così ho iniziato ""They All Fall Down"" (etichettato come psycho-thriller), ma che di psicologico aveva ben poco e che ho valutato con quattro stelline per il semplice fatto che non riuscivo a smettere di leggerlo e che alla fine la trama filava. Poi mi sono imbattuta ne ""la ragazza del treno"" e in alcune recensioni in cui si parlava dell'inattendibilità delle tre narratrici donne, inutile dire che la curiosità è salita alle stelle. Tuttavia ho aspettato a causa del rating basso su Amazon Italia, ma non potevo resistere a quella trama, così l'ho iniziato senza troppe aspettative... e finalmente ho trovato quello che mi aspettavo da uno psycho-thriller! Un libro che scorre e che ti spinge ad andare avanti per capire se quello che dicono le narratrici è vero o meno. L'alternarsi dei POV non fa altro che aggiungere curiosità a tutto il mistero, nessuno dei tre è banale o noioso, nessuno ti fa venire voglia di saltarlo per passare a quello di un'altra delle tre, anzi, probabilmente tutto il contrario: ne vorresti di più e un po' ti dispiace passare ad un altro POV, ma bastano poche righe e sei di nuovo immersa nella lettura. Poi boom il colpo di scena assolutamente inaspettato (per me) e la mia faccia era così o_O tutto si ribalta, tutto cambia e, a quel punto, anche volendo, non puoi mettere giù il libro fino alla fine. Girata l'ultima pagina sono rimasta solo con un grande senso di soddisfazione, niente ""bello, ma..."" o ""wow, ma"", solo la voglia di scrivere questa recensione per invogliarvi a leggerlo, perché veramente vale la pena e YOU WON'T SEE IT COMING. Ci sono in incongruenze o buchi di trama? Non saprei, forse qualcuno. L'unica pecca certa, in alcuni punti, è la traduzione palesemente sbagliata. Per il resto, merita tutto il successo che ha avuto!"
350,Jenna DeFrei,"I don't often read mysteries but read ""Gone Girl"" and ended up enjoying it a lot. I decided to read ""The Girl on the Train"" after hearing that it was similar to ""Gone Girl"". They do have their similarities, especially the writing style of the authors, which I very much like. One big difference for me though, was that I figured out ""Gone Girl"" quite early in the book."" ""Girl on the Train"" had me puzzling over it until only about 50 pages left. Paula Hawkins does a wonderful job with character development. The main characters aren't very likable but they are so alive and real, that you can't help but like them, as much as you dislike them. I felt like I knew Rachel and Anna personally, and that always makes for a great read! I'm very pleased I read this book! "
351,Océano de libros,"Lee la reseña completa en: http://oceanodelibros.blogspot.com.es/¿De qué trata?Rachel es una mujer que viaja todas las mañanas en el tren de las 8.04 para ir a trabajar a Londres; desde su asiento contempla el paisaje y observa con detenida atención, tanto es así que en un tramo en el que se detiene el tren observa siempre a una pareja. Poco a poco Rachel imagina la vida de ellos, le pone hasta nombres. Ahora hay un asesinato y quizás ella sea la única que podría conocer la verdad.La verdad es que he pensado mucho en esta reseña, quizás por ello voy a ser breve porque si me pusiera a contaros demasiado os estropearía el libro y creo que cuanto menos desvele será mucho mejor, conservaremos esa intriga.La sinopsis nos deja con el dato de que hay un asesinato y Rachel Watson, la protagonista de esta historia es la única que podría aclararlo. Rachel es una mujer tocada por el sufrimiento, hace poco que se acaba de divorciar y ahoga sus penas en el alcohol; como una especie de vía de escape se inventa vidas desde su asiento en el tren que le lleva cada mañana al trabajo.La novela está narrada en primera persona no solo por un personaje sino que son tres: Rachel, Megan y Anna. Tres personajes fundamentales que se entrelazarán poco a poco en el relato y que tienen mucho en común y que ver en la historia.Sin duda de todos los personajes me quedo con Rachel porque la pobre es como un perrito apaleado, donde le dan por todas partes. En ocasiones te dan ganas de matarla por seguir como sigue y en otras te da una pena terrible por ella. Con esto no estoy diciendo que sea buena"" eso lo debéis de averiguar vosotros. Del resto de personajes, tenemos a Tom, el exmarido de Rachel y su esposa Anna. Y a los vecinos que observa desde el tren, Megan y Scott.La ambientación con pocos recursos se logra y nos envuelve en ese halo de misterio, a través del día a día de Rachel nos sumergimos de lleno en una vida a punto de arruinarse por completo y otra inventada en busca de un pequeño alivio. La trama es un no parar, poco a poco iremos intentando descubrir la cara que corresponde al asesino o asesina, cada uno de los tres personajes es crucial para ir desenredándola; son tres puntos de vista interesantes para la historia.Hasta las últimas cien páginas no os quedará claro quién puede ser el asesino, así que estaremos en perpetua tensión y con la mosca detrás de la oreja y desconfiando de todo el mundo hasta casi el final. Es de esos libros con los que estás unos cuantos días dándole a a la cabeza y pensando.Voy a resumir esta novela en cuatro frases y acabo esta reseña:Intriga constante.Tan interesante que no pararás de leer.Me atrapó.Tenéis que leerlo."
352,Annina,"I really enjoyed this book since the style of telling this story was so different. Parted into 'morning' and 'evening' sessions it was always exciting to read what has happened during the night or during the day. It was interesting to read the views of Rachel, Megan and Anna and be able to slowly put the clues together to find out who the murderer ist. To be honest, I had two people in mind and I wasn't too far off with it. Also, I liked the characters. Yes, Rachel was annoying at times and I wanted to lock away the wine when she decided to get some more. Anna was hysterical most of the times. Megan bitchy and 'what? I don't care' - ish. But you can tell that all three woman are behaving because of reasons. I at least could feel with each of them. No matter how bad and irresponsible they were. I'm not saying I'm okay with it…I just see reason WHY they are behaving like this. It was interesting to read.And since I really enjoyed reading this book, it gets 5 out of 5 stars. xo"
353,Laura,Holy shit.
354,Karen,"An incredibly skillful use of an unreliable narrator. Although this book contains a mystery, I think its greatest strength is in the character studies: how we lie to others and to ourselves, and the variety of methods that we use to do so. Not an upbeat book, for sure, and yet not exactly depressing. Somehow, there's a certain beauty and grace in the sheer humanness of the flawed and complex characters. I found this to be extremely well written and, as an utterly fascinating read, it has made the shortlist of my favorite books."
355,Katy Jane ,"1. Omgomgomgomgomgomg2. I seriously couldn't put this book down. I would think about it in my purse and long for the moment we were back together.3. I got so scared at one point that it was physically painful for me to turn the next page. I turned it so slowly and then turned the book facedown and took a bathroom break to build up nerve to start reading again.4. It was just genius. Telling the story with three different women's perspective, the jump between morning and evening and different dates, not giving us a story from beginning to end but rather in pieces, every character being a little off so you don't really know whodunnit until the end. You had your guesses and you were pretty sure but you are never REALLY sure. Ugh. So good. 5. I also love that so much of the story is just the train and the neighborhood. You became one with this setting. And you also just wanted to walk the streets of Witney. 6. The baby in the tub. Nononono. I had to stop reading there, too. 7. What makes a book so readable for me? The dialog was great in this, the mystery pushes you along, the insider view of crazy lives does as well.8. Just read it."
356,Cyndi,So good! Starts out giving very little information and just keeps building and building until it completely sucks you in. One of the best books I have read in quite a while!
357,Samantha,"This book is excellent. I was hooked from the moment I started. I listened to the audio version and the women they had reading each of the three main characters helped to bring it to life, unlike other audiobooks that have the same narrator the whole way through. The major ending twist was a little predictable and I had it figured out before they got there, but it was still worth going on just to see how the women in the plot dealt with it. They did an excellent job of developing the two main women in the story (Rachel and Megan), the third could have had a little more depth (Anna). All the same, the ability to relate to the character's faults and desires and to root for them when they are struggling made me sad to have the book end, and for that I gave it 5 stars. "
358,Dawn,"Hard to put down, a real page turner....dark and chilling but a great read!"
359,Ece Demircioğlu," ////4,5 -> 5////O son... Gerçekten harikaydı. O katil çıkan arkadaş varya... Aşırı sinir oldum şuan spoiler vermeyeyim adını söyleyip.Çoğu kişiye ilk 150 sayfası sıkıcı gelmiş bana göre de öyleydi açıkçası ama kitabı bu yüzden bırakan çok kişi var ama bence sakın bırakmayın. Ben açıkçası katili tahmin edememiştim. Zaten kitap sonları tahmin etmede de fazla iyi olduğum söylenemez. Ben kitabı sevdim ama 5 puan veremiyorum maalesef... Neden olduğunu bende bilmiyorum ama kitaba 5 puan vermemi engelleyen bişey var. Ne olduğunu bende bilmiyorum ama belkide ilk sayfaların biraz sıkıcı olmasıdır. Ama bundan sadece yarım puancık kırıyorum çünkü beni pek rahatsız etmedi nedense. Instagram'da yorumumda ilk 150 sayfanın sıkıcı olmadığını söylemiştim ama şöyle bir düşününce... Kararımı değiştiriyorum. Benim kitaba puanım 4,5 fakat tam puan vermem gerektiği için iki saattir 4 ile 5 arasında gidip geliyorum ve sonuç olarak 5 puan veriyorum çünkü yarım puancık fazla vermekten zarar gelmez. :) Aynı zamanda şunu söylemeden geçemeyeceğim. İthaki Yayınları'na teşekkür ediyorum bu muhteşem kapak için. Favori kapaklarıma girdi bile. :)"
360,Kathrin,A Gone Girl type book. I liked it and at the same time didn't like the characters but good ending 
361,Jacci,I'm glad I listened to this on a long road trip. It started pretty slow and I might of given up on it. I'm glad I didn't. It really got good and I enjoyed trying to figure it out along the way! Well done! 
362,Mikka Gottstein,"Zuerst ein Hinweis: Ich habe dieses Buch im englischen Original von Randomhouse UK als Rezensionsexemplar zur Verfügung gestellt bekommen und gelesen. Daher kann ich keine Aussage treffen über die Qualität der deutschen Übersetzung. Da ich vom Übersetzer Christoph Göhler jedoch schon andere exzellente Übersetzungen gelesen habe, habe ich vollstes Vertrauen! Man hört immer wieder, dass Paula Hawkins mit Gillian Flynn verglichen wird, und ""The girl on the train"" mit deren Bestseller ""Gone Girl"". Da Gillian Flynn zu meinen absoluten Lieblingsautorinnen gehört, konnte ich es mir natürlich nicht entgehen lassen, selber zu vergleichen!Und? Ist da was dran? Meiner Meinung nach ja... Und nein. Ja, denn auch Paula Hawkins bedient sich eines ganz bestimmten Stilmittels sehr gekonnt, das Gillian Flynn bis zur Perfektion beherrscht: das des unzuverlässigen Erzählers. Die Geschichte wird aus Sicht dreier ganz unterschiedlicher Frauen erzählt, aber man kann sich als Leser niemals blind auf das verlassen, was sie sagen. Sie belügen sich selbst oder werden von anderen belogen, sie vertrauen auf eine Wahrheit, die so gar nicht existiert, oder erschaffen sich selber eine kleine heile Traumwelt... Das ist unglaublich clever geschrieben - und spannend, denn man will unbedingt herausfinden, was wirklich hinter all dem Lug und Trug steckt! Ja, denn auch Paula Hawkins ist eine Meisterin darin, über egoistische, zutiefst gestörte Frauen zu schreiben, mit denen man aber dennoch irgendwie mitfühlen kann - und sogar muss... Ich habe unzählige Male laut aufgestöhnt, wenn Rachel die falsche Entscheidung traf, denn entgegen jeder Vernunft wollte ich so sehr, dass sie ihr Leben in den Griff bekommt und es für sie ein Happy End gibt! ""Nein, nein, nein, bitte tu das nicht..."" war ein immer wieder kehrendes Mantra. Ich fand die Protagonisten und Protagonistinnen großartig, mit all ihren charakterlichen Schwächen, emotionalen Wunden und moralischen Fragwürdigkeiten. Ja, es gibt in dieser Geschichte einen Kriminalfall, aber das Buch ist dennoch kein typischer Krimi oder Thriller! Die Seiten habe ich nicht wirklich deswegen umgeblättert, um das Verbrechen aufgeklärt zu sehen, sondern weil ich so viele Emotionen in die Charaktere investiert hatte und sehen wollte, wohin die Reise sie führt. Krimi, Thriller, Drama...? Ich weiß es nicht so genau, aber was immer es ist, es ist in meinen Augen fantastisch.Ja, denn auch die Atmosphäre unterschwelligen Unheils, die Paula Hawkins mit eindringlichen Bildern und einem packenden Schreibstil heraufbeschwört, ist Lesern von Gillian Flynn vertraut. Warum also das nein? Nein, ""The girl on the train"" ist nicht ""Gone Girl 2.0"", denn obwohl die Atmosphäre ähnlich ist und die Autorinnen sich auch ähnlicher Stilmittel bedienen, haben die Handlungen beider Romane nur auf den ersten Blick oberflächliche Gemeinsamkeiten. Meiner Meinung nach handelt es sich hier um zwei ganz unterschiedliche Bücher, die beide auf ihre eigene Art und Weise außergewöhnlich und mehr als lohnend sind!Ich würde es so ausdrücken: zwei Maler können die gleichen Pinsel, die gleichen Farben und sogar die gleichen Maltechniken verwenden und doch gänzlich andere Bilder malen. Die Geschichte von ""The girl on the train"" ist originell und spielt augenzwinkernd mit den Erwartungen erfahrener Thriller-Leser.Die Handlung erstreckt sich über mehrere Zeitebenen, und so bekommt man als Leser immer neue Bruchstücke aus Vergangenheit und Gegenwart zu sehen, kann dabei aber nie mit Sicherheit sagen, was jetzt Ursache ist und was Wirkung... Ich habe immer wieder neue Theorien aufgestellt, was wirklich geschehen sein könnte und warum, wer hier die Guten sind und wer die Bösen - und im Endeffekt war dann doch alles ganz anders. Der Schreibstil der Autorin hat mir sehr gut gefallen. Besonders gelungen fand ich, wie sie den drei Erzählerinnen ihre ganz eigenen, unverwechselbaren ""Stimmen"" gibt. Fazit:""Traue niemandem, nicht einmal dir selbst"", das könnte das Motto dieses Buches sein. Drei Frauen, die alle nicht das sind, was sie zu sein scheinen, und deren Schicksale durch Liebe und Verrat miteinander verknüpft sind, erzählen eine Geschichte, die irgendwo zwischen Thriller und Drama ihren dunklen Sog entfaltet.Die Autorin wird oft mit der Bestsellerautorin Gillian Flynn verglichen - und muss den Vergleich nicht scheuen, denn sie hat in meinen Augen ein ganz außergewöhnliches Buch geschrieben."
363,Gatorman,"Fascinating and terrifically entertaining story about a woman whose life is rather on the skids from alcohol who takes the train each day and likes to look out the window, imagining things about those she observes. One day, she sees something that bothers her, and what happens to her and those around her after the incident propels the story into many surprising different paths. The reader is never quite sure if the main character, Rachel, knows what she is talking about when she describes things in her life. The ending, which had me glued to each page, explains everything in a tense, thrilling fashion. What is most surprising about the book is that none of the major characters are likeable, including Rachel, but the story is so gripping that, like in Gone Girl, it doesn't detract from the story. It's rare that a book can pull that off. This one does, big time. Very highly recommended. "
364,Kaya,"4.5 stars, more likely.  “There’s nothing so painful, so corrosive as suspicion.”  I admit, I had a fear this book is overrated, but on contrary, it's more than satisfying. This is a fine psychological thriller with an interesting twist I didn't see coming. Hawkins does a great job in digging inside protagonist's head and making the story believable. This book follows Rachel, Megan and Anna leading their dysfunctional lives, each in their own way. The truth is not one character has redeeming qualities and I hated every single one of them. Honestly, this is the book's strongest virtue - the ability to absolutely loathe all characters, but at the same time to care for the plot.At Rachel's old house, her ex-husband lives with his new wife and their daughter. Near them live Megan and Scott, whose marriage Rachel thinks of as everything she wants and everything she's lost. If you dig deeper, you see Megan and Scott's bond isn't that healthy. Firstly, I thought Megan just ran away with a lover. Then I thought Rachel had something to do with her disappearance and she fails to remember it. My last wrong presumption was that Anna hurt her. I never guessed the real bad guy. Rachel is hopelessly lonely, drowning the sorrows of her failed marriage with canned gin and tonic and endless bottles of wine. She has lost her job because of her everlasting intoxication, but rather than telling her roommate, she keeps on taking the train into London every day, pretending to go to work. Actually, she just gets drunk in different places. Megan goes missing, the same day Rachel had seen her kissing the other man. Of course, Rachel saw it all from the train. The next morning, Rachel wakes up and feels something is terribly wrong, but fails to remember the night before.This book is a page - turner, at first you wonder what has happened to Megan, and then who did it. Throughout the book I kept guessing who is the most dangerous among them. Truth be told, they ARE ALL horrible characters. The plot builds sensibly until you desperately want to know the truth. Everything is precisely plotted and not one single chapter feels like a filler, carefully describing one unreliable narrator after another. These three women are so flawed and foolish, representing everything a dignified woman wouldn't want to be. As much as it is extremely hard to empathize with them, it’s so easy to fall in love with the book in general. Rachel is a stalker who doesn't respect other people's privacy. As much as she irritated me, her issues and her mental development kept me going through the novel. The reader goes through all stages of alcohol abuse and overall dysfunction. It gets strenuous at times, but in the end there is a reason why she's so broken and it might not be her fault entirely.  “I have never understood how people can blithely disregard the damage they do by following their hearts.”  Yes, Rachel, like you weren’t „following your heart“ while stalking Tom and his wife, which made her constantly anxious. Ugh, she truly is a horrible protagonist. She keeps relaying on other people's pity towards her even though she's ashamed of it. It's so frustrating to read. “Sometimes I catch myself trying to remember the last time I had meaningful physical contact with another person, just a hug or a heartfelt squeeze of my hand, and my heart twitches.“  I despise Rachel. She was drowning in her self-pity and even she kept on making things even worse. She knew she was a burden to her roommate Katie and she had no will to change it. I don't even believe she had a true intention of dealing with her alcoholism. Megan is self-centered, attention whore and selfish to the bone. She has borderline personality disorder and lives double life. Being dependent on male attention, she's attracted only to unstable men with a tendency to be agressive.  “I can’t do this, I can’t just be a wife. I don’t understand how anyone does it — there is literally nothing to do but wait. Wait for a man to come home and love you. Either that or look around for something to distract you.”  Megan was the best narrator of all three women and at moments I think I liked her. She made fatal mistakes in her past and was utterly cruel, but her inner struggles were compelling to me. It's too bad she couldn't be happy with herself.Anna is paranoid of Rachel, fragile and submissive. She enjoys in building her happiness in other's sorrow and she refuses to accept that the same can happen to her. Even though she is generally happy, she isn't completely satisfied with being only a wife and a mother. "
365,Samantha Luciano,I'm trying to process this right now. All I can say is that y'all should definitely read this. It will keep you on the edge of your seat. I really recommend this.
366,Fabiana,"Libro assolutamente fantastico, da leggere! Finito in pochi giorni mi ha tenuta sveglia varie notti; la storia è avvincente e i personaggi sono credibili tanto da catturarti e renderti partecipe del racconto. Scritto davvero bene, si merita il successo ottenuto. "
367,DJ,"What the F*** did I just read?Seriously, I feel like I'm sitting in the middle of these people, watching their stories play out. And as they go along, their tales begin to twist and turn until I find myself in a knot with only one solution, but I'm not sure it's actually the correct solution.Told from three points of view--Rachel, Megan, and Anna--this story is about a murder, a divorce, a drunkard, a liar and a mystery of how they all connect. It starts simple. A tale too easy to figure out. Emotions begin to be fiddled with. You're feeling wretched and sorry for one character, hateful and vengeful towards another. And then, FLIP A FEW PAGES OVER, and you don't feel anything like you did. Everything you thought you knew, from what these characters told you, turns out to be entirely wrong. But not entirely. But your original thought was right. That's how this story just twists you until you're lost int he forest with no bread crumbs to help lead you out.That is why this story is worth a read. I've not been on this confusing path in a while.I'm still trying to figure out the GONE GIRL comparisons. Outside of very unreliable narrators, there just isn't a link. Both great reads.Read THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN if you are looking for something to f*** with your head, because this will do it, and do it very well. "
368,Satomi,"There is no ""normal"" people in this world, I thought. More or less this is true, I think. This book was a page turner! Ending was better than Gone Girl, but the same excitement. Great read!"
369,Dalia,"نقدر نقول انها رواية من الادب النَسائي: الكاتبة سيدة، الشخصيات الرئيسية في الرواية تلات سيدات، و التلاتة بيقومو بدور الراوي او ال narrator بالاضافة لكدا الرواية بتوصف مشاعر التلات سيدات دول بمنتهى الدقة، مشاعر مش ممكن تحسها الا واحدة ست؛ و بالتالي محدش هيكتبها بالدقة دي الا واحدة ست :)و اللي يُحسب للكاتبة ان التلات شخصيات النسائية دول مختلفين تماماً عن بعض؛ علشان محدش يتهمها انها كتبت دا لانها مرت بتجارب حياتية مشابهة؛ علشان كدا قدرت توصل ادق تفاصيل احاسيس كل شخصية من التلاتة (y) الرواية مُشوِّقة جدا، ابعد ما تكون عن الملل من اول صفحة لاخر صفحة، تشدك حتى لو كنت عارف و متوقع النهاية، الجُمل بسيطة و عميقة في نفس الوقت، سهلة و مباشرة و بعيدة عن اي ""فزلكات"" لغوية ممكن تفصلك عن الاسترسال.لاحِظت ان مختلف المنتديات الادبية و المقالات النقدية لما بتتكلم عن الرواية دي بتقارنها ب gone girlيمكن علشان الاتنين بيتكلمو عن اختفاء زوجة، و توجه الاتهامات للزوج مرة و لعشيق سابق مرة، و الاخر نلاقي كونفليكت في الاحداث، بس لما تقرا الروايتين هتلاقي مفيش اي اوجه تشابه: لا على مستوى الاحداث، و لا على مستوى الكتابة حتى.اه الروايتين لهن نفس التيمة الادبية؛ لكن معروف ان الادب فيه تيمات محدودة، الادباء بيتناولوها بأساليب مختلفة : مثلاً ""الملك لير"" و ""الاخوة كرامازوف"" الاتنين بيتكلمو عن عقوق الابناء نتيجة الطمع، بس دا مش معناه اننا نقول ان ""الاخوة كرامازوف"" نوع من ال fanfic ""مدام بوفاري"" و ""انا كارنينا"" من جهة، و ""عالم شجاع جديد"" و ""١٩٨٤"" من جهة اخرى، و امثلة كتيرة لروايات بتتشابه مع بعضها في الفكرة او التيمة؛ لكن في النهاية كل رواية فيهم مختلفة في الطرح و التناول عن غيرها.باختصار رواية لما تقراها هتسيب عندك حالة من المتعة، و مش هتحس انك ضيعت وقتك على الفاضي؛ فعلاً تستاهل تبقا بيست سيلر و تستاهل انها تكون حديث المنتديات الادبية السنة دي :)"
370,Shatan,"Many reviews have named The Girl on the Train ""the next Gone Girl"" but honestly, I don't understand why! Besides the fact that both have the word ""girl"" in it's title and that they both are in the same genre which is psychological thriller, that couldn't be farther from the truth. To me that's almost like saying all psychological thrillers are just like Gone Girl and we all know that's the furtherest thing from the truth! Amy Elliott Dunne in Gone Girl thoroughly plotted out her crime until she couldn't anymore. The crime that happened in The Girl on the Train happened due to inconvenience and wasn't planned in the least bit! The Girl on the Train was a good read (yes, even through it's not the next ""Gone Girl""). I listened to the audible, and I have to say that in the beginning, I did find it difficult to figure out who was who, since the book was told in many POV's. I did have to jot down who everyone was at first, so I wouldn't get confused but after that hurdle, I found it smoother to listen to. As many would think from the title, that the book all took place on the train but that's simply not true after reading the first couple of chapters you quickly figure that out. It's more like what was seen on the train and by who… and can that memory be trusted?! Mistrust in this book goes beyond that of one's tainted memory but to all the characters who all at one point or another do not trust each other.Like many people, Rachel Watson intently observes life around her. Mainly through the vision of a lonely, angry, and bitter ex-wife, but also through the eyes of an alcoholic. Through the haze of her curiosity which blur unto downright nosiness. which in all honesty, actually goes beyond the normalcy of just watching life's surroundings, she meddles, she pokes her nose where it doesn't belong, she has a hard time grasping what's really happened during the crime she partially witnessed. Sometimes grief and pain cloud peoples' judgements and they act out in ways you least expect, the author did an excellent job of portraying these characteristic's in Rachel. This book did leave me on the edge of my seat often. Once I thought, I knew what was going to happen the chapter changed and it was on to the next person's point of view that had nothing to do with the last's persons. When I did figure out who did it, I still found myself intrigued on what was going to happen next! "
371,Luís Fernandes,"Bloody brilliant! Everything was bloody brilliant. The writing, the characters, the plot, everything! The character development is awesome, and the characters are layered, each with its own demons, fears, dreams... You never know who you can trust, and the author keeps you guessing on who is a killer and who trustworthy. For a more keen reader, the key to solving the mystery is there, but hidden in a massive amount of threads that never allows you to be 100% sure of anything. The ending might be a bit cliché, but it fits the story very well. A must read for everyone!!!"
372,Kerry,Wow! This mystery kept me guessing the whole way through! I loved how Hawkins rotated the perspective among the female leads. She developed the character of Rachel so well; the reader learned more and more about her as she was discovering more about herself. Well done!
373,Vasco,http://viajarpelaleitura.blogspot.pt/...
374,Carole Anderson,"I had heard mixed reviews of this book from friends, so even though it was on my bookshelf, I hesitated reading it. I really like it though. It was definitely written different from 3 women's point of view and sometimes I wanted to smack Rachel, the main character, but I love the way the story was told from the different perspectives. It more than kept my interest and ask usual I went back and forth on who the killer was, sure I knew each time until something else was revealed. That, to me, is the sign of a good book."
375,Hillary,wowzers
376,Evin Elizabeth,"I got The Girl on The Train for my birthday last week and I devoured it! All I wanted to do was read this book. I took it to the gym, I stayed up way too late reading it and I took it into the bath and read until the water was cold, it was that captivating.The story follows three women and is told in morning and evening segments, following the timetable for the commuter train in and out of London. Between the made-up fantasies, the love triangles, the mental breakdowns, and the struggle to be a better person this book just gives and gives.So while it’s a mystery thriller, it isn’t scary or gory. There’s a lot of psychology involved and the reader really gets to delve into the minds of the narrators (there are three) and see why they make the decisions they do. I really liked that added depth!I also found it interesting that, in my opinion at least, there is no clear protagonist. Yes, there are main characters of course, but I despised and adored each character at some point throughout the book. You hate the decisions they make and then you love some insight they have on the world. You are certain they’re just totally screwed up and then you find out what triggered it and you’re empathetic to their choices. This book has so many layers, and each one was crafted to fit with the others beautifully. And I loved all the back stories and character development!I was honestly sad when I finished this book. I had to detox from reading for a few days before I could start another because I was in mourning that I had finished it. Usually, I read books that have gotten a lot of hype, either award winners or NYT bestsellers, and I am disappointed because they never live up to the hype, but The Girl on The Train most definitely deserves every bit of praise that it has received. Plus, you don't figure out the killer until the very end!I'm hoping that someone writes a really artsy/indie screenplay and turns this story into a brilliant mini-series or a movie. It deserves so much more than to be a fluffy studio production.If you haven’t read this book yet go buy it, download it, or check it out from the library. If you already own it, drop everything you're doing, bookmark your current book and start this one!http://www.magnoliasandsunlight.com/2..."
377,CJ,"I'd like to give this a 4 1/2 but, as I can't, will go with 5 based on my interest in the story and the way the author was able to weave all the characters and details together into an intricate tapestry of mystery, flawed characters, and hidden agendas. Though none of the characters were likeable, their behaviors had me reacting with an emotional repulsion and brought the story close to me. I kept getting confused with the dates of the character entries and my constant turning back in the book to get on track with the timeline detracted about a half star from my liking it completely. But it was compelling and fascinating, which was frustrating to me when I had no time for it once I'd begun. Once I did, it was a day spent with it in my lap. If you liked Gone Girl, you'll like The Girl On The Train. If you didn't like Gone Girl, I'd say you should pass it by. "
378,"Bestsellers, Booze, & Baking","I absolutely loved this book. The Girl On the Train is definitely a must-read for 2015. It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time because I didn't know what was going to happen next. I thought this book was so well-written, and I loved seeing many different people's perspectives. I was so surprised by the ending! This is a book that I will read over and over again even though the ending won't be a surprise anymore.On my blog, I created an English Toffee Pudding based on this book! Find it at my link text!"
379,Maddy Edwards,Just wow! This was really awesome. I loved the different perspectives and trying to keep track of what was real and what you weren't sure about! This kept me reading and on the edge of my seat!
380,Roland Karang,"So tense, the alcoholic character is so deep, astounding story, impatient to reverse the page to reveal the truth."
381,Rachael,"I am a people-watcher. I find it very entertaining to watch people as they go on with their everyday, mundane tasks. I think a lot of people do this. The Girl on the Train explores this practice and what can happen if you take it much too far. Rachel is struggling to keep her head above water after her husband leaves her for another woman, and she loses her job because of her alcohol problem. In order to avoid having to tell her roommate that she has lost her job, Rachel continues taking the commuter train into London every day, where she people-watches and drinks excessively. Every day on the train, she passes by the street where she shared a home with her ex-husband, and sees a couple just a few doors down that she becomes enthralled with. She imagines their perfect life and love, all from her seat on the train. But one morning she sees something at their home that shocks her and crushes her fantasy of their perfect life; and the next day the wife (Megan) disappears.Because of her drinking problem, Rachel often has blackouts. She begins having flashbacks to the night that Megan went missing, and realizes that she was in their neighborhood on the night of the crime. As she tries to put the pieces together, she begins entangling herself in the investigation. And everyone, including herself, seems capable of doing harm to Megan.I’m not exaggerating in the slightest when I say that this is one of the best psychological thrillers that I have ever read. I absolutely did not want to put it down. This book contained three very, very flawed narrators (Rachel – the girl on the train; Anna – “the other woman”, now married to Rachel’s ex; and Megan – the girl who has disappeared without a trace), who were all at times intensely unlikable, and yet I felt sympathetic towards each of them. As all of the pieces of the mystery kept coming together, I really did not know who possibly could have been responsible for Megan’s disappearance. And my theory on “whodunnit” changed about a dozen times throughout the course of the book, all leading up to the shocking and satisfying conclusion. I cannot recommend this book highly enough.This review also appears on my blog, Reading Rachael."
382,Cheryl Lomas,"After so much hype about this book, I thought I'd better read it myself. I found myself unable to put it down and read it voraciously until I had finished it !I did find it a bit confusing at times with which character was which and which year I was in and found myself going back to the beginning of the chapters to find out, but overall I found the book very enjoyable, extremely page turning and I couldn't wait to find out the ending ! In my humble opinion it did live up to the hype and I would recommend it to anybody."
383,Stuart,"A great book! A missing person mystery, turning in to a murder mystery, told from the viewpoints of three different women. First Rachel, who commuted to London every weekday, and, when her train stops at the lights as it does nearly every day, fantasizes about the lives of the people she sees living in the houses by the train line. Then we have the lives of two of the women who live in the street beside the train line. All of them are damaged in one way or another. Then we have their husbands, who are sometimes not very nice people... Now one of them goes missing..... And Rachel thinks she can help because she thinks she saw (Rear Window style) an incriminating event. But the police find her an unreliable witness (alcoholic, blackout-prone...). Should she insert herself into the investigation? Will that help or hinder? The story is rivetingly told, at great pace, in the three voices, all in the present tense, as the mystery unfolds. I liked it a lot. "
384,Ardette,"This book is not for the squeamish. It will make you squirm , tense up, be scared, be angry , say WTF more than once. No one is how they appear. They all have secrets.Read this book of if you are a fan of books written in the style of Gone Girl, The Silent Wife,by A S Harrison ,Always Watching by Chevy Stevens, A Circle Of Wives by Alice LaPlante , The Dark Tide and Into The Darkest Corner by Elizabeth Haynes. "
385,Phil Flowers,Incredible writing & 1st person throughout the book... couldn't put it down & read it in a day...
386,Adrianne,4.5 starsvery intriguing. it's like a Hitchcock film. thought the end wasn't as mindblowing as I expected it to be
387,Carol Stankey,WOW! Loved it! 
388,Jordan Mcadory,"One of the most interesting books I've read in terms of plot twists and unexpected endings. I've heard this book compared to a second rate version of Gone Girl, but I thought it was a better read!"
389,Ruby Bibi,"Phenominal mystery taking place in the U.K. A woman is introduced who is taking a train in the morning from the suburbs of London into the city, and then, at the end of the day, back to the suburbs. As she passes a particular location, she most often sees a married couple in front of their home and they're obviously a loving couple.As the book progresses, we discover that the woman, Rachel, was previously married and her husband, Tom, left her for another woman, Anna. The woman that Rachel usually sees from the train, Megan, goes missing, and Rachel gets involved in the mystery of what happened to her. Complicating things is that both Megan and Anna live a few doors from each other, and Anna lives in the home that Rachel lived in when she was married to Tom. Rachel started drinking at the end of her marriage and can't remember past events, but something happened to Rachel that can shed a light as to what happened to Megan.Each of the three women take turns in giving their stories, and it's almost written in diary format. Extremely interesting and very well done as events slowly unfold. You feel you get into the essence of each character as they bare their feelings throughout the story."
390,Madison Hickman,"""The Girl on the Train"" takes character development to a whole new level! The three females that narrate the book add so much dynamic to the story. I love a good psychological thriller and ""The Girl on the Train"" didn't disappoint. Paula Hawkins is a fantastic writer who kept me glued to her pages. If you're a fan of dark twisted storytelling look no further, the train has arrived! "
391,Clare,"OMG this book was AWESOME! First and foremost as a HUGE fan of The Killers, I love you Paula Hawkins for mentioning them in this book. LOL. Now on with the review. I'm not going to post any spoilers so a short one from me. I decided to read this book purely based on the title, I didn't read the blurb going in and the opening paragraphs hooked me straight away. This is a psychological thriller and it does not disappoint. If you love a mystery or a whodunnit' then this book deserves a read. It has multiple POVs which are very easy to grasp and understand.It has characters that are relatable and likeable, and of course a few villainous ones too. I did liken it to Gone Girl but in my opinion this is better. I adored that this was set in the UK, I felt it made this book so much better for me as a Brit, I was smiling often as I read things that were very relatable. This book definitely jumped into my 'favourite books' shelf. "
392,Nichole Marshall,Could not put it down!! 
393,Kirstie Welford,This was narrated by (and full of) crazy characters which made for an impossible to put down read. Loved it!
394,Beyza,"Çoğunlukla okula metroyla giderken oturma imkânım olduysa okudum. Son hızlanan bölümleri evde bugün bitirdim ve iyi ki evde okumuşum. Yüz ifademi normal tutamazmıştım :)Yorum yakında -umarım, bir boşluk bulabildiğimde- gelecek :)"
395,Faramallera,"Solo he leído otro libro con un tipo de redacción como esta, y fue ""La Decisión más Difícil"" (My Sister's Keeper) y aunque la primera persona es un poco fastidiosa, te atrapa... hasta el punto que me lo leí en dos días (creo que es un record personal, jaja). Excelente... Definitivamente hay que leerlo."
396,Sharon Jones,This was a great psychological mystery. It starts off with the narration by two women on to a whole cast of characters. Twists and turns leaving one with doubts about all concerned. A surprise ending and a great mystery. You must read this if you like suspense.
397,Apple ,"This is indeed a fast-paced thriller, it will keep you guessing until the very end. And what's so creepy about this is the fact that the characters seem all too real. Why? Because they could be anyone you know. Your neighbor, your cousin, your friend. Every person has a limit, for tolerance, patience, anger, violence. And if any one of us gets to that point and we black out in anger, in fury, who's to say what we would be capable of doing? This is depressing if you take it too seriously but I have to commend Paula Hawkins, she maneuvered the story so wonderfully that you don't know who is wrong and right, who is good or bad. But isn't that what's at our very core as human beings? We can be both good and bad, we have flaws, as well as commendable character traits. In the end, it's what we do with those traits that makes us good or bad. It's the choices we make that make us criminals or law-abiding citizens. Read, read, read it!"
398,Tina H,Could not put it down!
399,Ellie,"This book is told from three different perspectives: Rachel is an alcoholic who rides the train to and from London every day, watching the houses and imagining the peoples' lives. Megan is one of those people, and she spends every day fighting within her own head about what to do -- does she still likes her husband, or should she run away? Anna is the new wife of Tom, Rachel's ex-husband. They live in Rachel's old house with their baby girl, Evie. Rachel, depressed with how her life has turned out, spends her days drinking, usually ending with making a rude, drunken call to Tom.One day, Rachel sees Megan's face in the news -- she's gone missing. Rachel has to battle her blackouts -- she knows she saw something important, but she can't remember. She knows she has to help.This book, widely regarded as the next ""Gone Girl,"" is a psychological thriller. It's a strange feeling, as a reader, when the main character is such an unlikeable woman who is unwilling to help herself. However, with more and more information, more revelations, you begin to see why she is how she is. She has to fight for herself, for people to believe her, to have purpose in the world. ""The Girl on the Train"" is a solid thriller and I will definitely be reading any future books from Paula Hawkins."
400,Liz29,brilliant
401,Shaima Amanda,"OMG, this book is fantastic! I had LOVED Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn so when I heard that The Girl on the Train is just like it, but faster-paced, creepier and darker, you couldn't imagine my excitement! I was jumping up and down my bed and dancing around my room when I finally got my hands on the book.....And Paula Hawkins delivered! Enter Rachel and Megan; they are two ordinary women or so as it might appear in the first chapters, leading two very different lives, but are they different really? Their characters are written up so beautifully that their misery, pain, emptiness and darkness reverberates from the pages of the book out into your world. You can FEEL the darkness. The misery. The emptiness. During the first half of the book, all I kept thinking is how Rachel looks out the window and imagines other people leading perfect lives but up close, everyone's damaged, lonely, running from their own demons with major skeletons at the back of their closets. Everyone's a mess. And then Anna's narration starts. Her side of the story was what I was the least bit interested in. If anything, it annoyed me. But by the end of the book, everything is turned upside down. When you find out all the truth, the truth is so terrible. So deliciously terrible. You think you know someone, but think again, because you don't. Not in the slightest. It's a book that's difficult to put down. You are on that train with Rachel and there's no way you can get off now. "
402,Courtney,"WOW, WOW, WOW! I rarely give a book 5 stars, but I started this book at noon yesterday and it's 9:05 am and I'm DONE because I couldn't put it down. This book is a 10x better than ""Gone Girl"" type read with vague undertones and very strongly developed (albeit completely crazy) characters that gripped me from page 1. Rachel, the actual girl on the train, is a mentally unstable raging alcoholic prone to black outs and rough, hungover mornings who has actually lost her job but puts on a façade of boarding the train each and every morning where she passes by a couple she is completely taken with ""Jason and Jess"". Unbeknownst to her, Jason and Jess are actually Scott and Megan - he a completely devoted, head over heels husband, she a troubled young sometimes-philanderer who is babysitting for Tom and Anna - Tom is Rachel's charming ex-husband and Anna is his once-mistress turned wife (make sure you pay attention!)When something sinister happens to one of the characters, they become irrevocably intertwined as they muddled through a very untraditional ""whodunit"" type story. HIGHLY recommend for all readers - you will not be able to stop until the very last page!"
403,Manuel Gómez,"Me salia en todos lados este libro; facebook, twitter, librerias... Estaba dando qué hablar y yo me sentía atraído. ¿Habrá sido el titulo tan falto de los típicos betseller que se inclinan con palabras rebuscadas y que no definen nada?Bueno, sea lo que sea ya lo leí en menos de 4 días y me gustó tanto que incluso me veré la próxima película adaptación que tendrá.Mi reseña en cuanto a la historia son dos cosas: Uno, que es impredecible y dos que si usted que lee esto, y ya ha visto Gone girl (esa de Ben Affleck) y le gustó, lea este libro. Es una Must-read del año."
404,Shaina Stark,Worth the hype. That's how you write a book (would have liked the characters a little more sympathetic however) and that's how you end a book. 
405,Nicole Lawson,This has honestly been one of my favorite books in a while. It is written to keep you guessing and always wonder what lies in people's past to motivate them to such actions. It also reminds us that sometimes our own memories have a way of tricking us. I would highly recommend this book and I'll be watching for this author's next book!
406,Kim Park,"The distinct voices of the three narrators in this story are most appealing. Rachel is the insecure one. Meghan is the confused one. And Anna is the distant one, the almost cruel one. They each have their own interpretations of the same events, which when seen from their individual perspectives never jive with the same meaning. This multiple-meanings angle is so human, so true to real life.Take for example, Anna's admission of feeling no guilt when she manipulated her way into the life of a married man. This is only too believable; though she told her friends she felt guilty, she really didn't. In fact, she got a little thrill out of the idea that the wife might happen by the restaurant and see her and the husband together and instantly know that she had taken him from her. Sick! But wow, what a believable character.I very much appreciate the author's understanding of human emotions and her effort to describe them. "
407,Christina Penland,"WOnderful!! Edgy, thriller, mystery!! Great read!!!"
408,Gerry Moylan,"A refreshing thriller with wonderful characters. The protagonist is a mess, but the mess she gets herself into helps her grow and gives her a promising future. Dark, edgy... and I love that it's told by three of the key players. A boring daily ride on the commuter train turns into a nail-biting murder and our downtrodden lead character is caught in the middle. Fantastic!"
409,Sharyn Hutchens,"one of the best The description and title drew me in and the book never let go of me till the last page. The characters are all imperfect, and identifying with them is difficult, but that just increases their intrigue somehow. By the end of the book, I'd become very attached to some of them. The writing is straightforward and clean, and the plot moves along at a good pace. Suspense builds especially towards the end the twist took me totally by surprise. But it made sense when I looked back...yeah, that was kind of suspicious, now I think about it; yes, I can see now how that happened. That sort of thing. It's a well-written thriller deserving of its good reviews. I'll be looking for more by this author."
410,Neil Pittman,"Look out Gillian and Tana, there's some competition in town. A wholly psychological thriller with information doled out in such small pieces you'd think Hawkins was training dolphins. This book goes deeper into alcoholism and dysfunctional relationships than most thrillers. Told from the viewpoint of three distinct narrators, the twists and turns emerge at a maddeningly slow, yet somehow breakneck pace. Hawkins is on my must read list."
411,Leylamanderson,Wow! I couldn't put the book down and stayed up last night to finish it. Definitely a must read.
412,Martina Hlúbiková,"The Girl on the train is a brilliant crime novel. The way it is written is catching, although I am nit sure if a drunk woman is really a good main character for the book. But it turned well in this case.Story is about the broken woman, drunk unstable, divoreced Rachel. One of the narratives. She is divorced already for two years ans she commutes every day to London by train and watch people, their houses fron the window. She makes up stories about their lives, gives them names. Akso for Jess and Jason perfect couple she used to watch and inagine how great they life is, the same as her was before. She lives now in a rented room with Cathy and she was fired from her PR job, because of coming drunk during lunch. Tom, her ex-husband seems to live a pleasant life in the same house they bought together with woman Anna, he was unfaithful to Rachel. One day a woman, Rach used watch from the train, is kissing with an unknown man outside on lawn of their house. That night Rachel tottally drunk goes to see her ex. She does nit remember what happeed to her that night, only that she has a big cut on her head. That night also Megan (Jess) disappeares and is missing for 2 weeks. The main suspects are her husband Scott and her lover, therapist Kamal. The destiny of all three women is entangled and it is interesting to watch how all their perfect lives (except of Rachel's) change, how all the lies are uncovered.Great first book for Paula. This book is perfect, thrilling and I can't wait to see it made into a movie soon. "
413,Merryn,"Absolutely loved this book. It took a little while to get going, but man once it did it had me hooked! I have discovered that I love books with messed up and complicated characters and this book definitely had a wide variation. The twist I did not see coming and the ending more than satisfying. can't wait to pick up the authors next novel!"
414,James,"I think it just rips and moves along with a pretty quick pace, lots of chances for everyone to be a suspect in this pretty awesome summer read. It made me think of Gone Girl, but it stands alone as its own unique creation: the conceit of train rides back and forth, the fading and uncertain narration, the shifting style. I read it in only a few days, and I think it is pretty intense read. "
415,Amelia,"This is probably one of the best suspense novels I've read in a while and I believe it has everything to do with the characters. Everyone was practically a suspect... except the actual culprit.The thing is, when you have an array of flawed characters: from anger management problems, control freaks, alcoholics, mild OCD, it's hard to pin down any one person. People don't necessarily have ""motive"" but... they could have done it. Maybe that's what I found so appealing about the writing style as well. The main protagonists each got a chance to say their story. To validate their actions. And it worked for the plot.All in all, I would totally recommend this book if you're looking for a good suspense to read. I've seen a lot of people compare and contrast this story to that of ""Gone Girl"" but I have not read that yet to do the same."
416,Anna Gracheva,"I personally can't say I hated this book like some people here claim. I hated all the characters at some point or another, that's for sure. But I did love everything else: the writing, the pace, not knowing who to trust and expect a plot twist every chapter. The story is solid, addictive and keeps the reader hooked till the very end. The characters are genuine, as it really seems you're getting a peak of Rachel's, Megan's and Anna's lifes. Those girls could be real persons and like every and each of us the hold at least one secret. And like some of us, they are insecure, lost and confused. They struggle to keep it together and they're too weak to let go of abusive relationships. Their problems are very real, and anyone near you could be struggling with the same: your mom, a friend, a neighbour. The book is also overwhelming, as you get yourself going trhough the stages of hate, distrust, compassion, concern and frustration. I love how nothing about this story is sugar coated and the author suprises us with raw moments of violence and abuse, physical and emotional that are heavier because of the fact that you get so caught up in the story that you forget this is fiction. I didn't love the end though. It ties the loose ends but it just didn't stands up to the rest of the story. Certanly a must read."
417,Sandra Grauschopf,"The problem with reading a story that's promoted as having a lot of twists is that half the time, you spend so much time wondering where the twists are going to come and where they're gong to lead that by the end, you wonder where they were to begin with (see In the Dark, for example).Luckily, Girl on the Train manages to live up to its twisty reputation. It sets you up to believe one thing, then deftly diverts your attention to something else, so that bits of the characters' viewpoints and motivations are revealed a little at the time.The pace was excellent, maybe a little slower at the beginning than I would have expected given the hype, but ratcheting up to un-put-down-able by the end. The tension was very high throughout, and the plotting excellent.One critique I've seen in a lot of reviews is that none of the characters are particularly likeable, and this is true. If you have to like or look up to a character to enjoy a book, this probably isn't a good choice for you. If you can enjoy flawed characters, go for it.The biggest problem I saw in the writing is that there are three narrators, and they all sound alike. You can't easily tell without checking who is narrating each chapter. But then again, there are a lot of similarities among the three; maybe the lack of different voices is a feature, not a bug? I'm not sure.All in all, I loved it, and I would recommend it to any fan of thrillers or mysteries."
418,Stephanie Latuso,LOVED! LOVED! LOVED! Soo good!!
419,Aathira Jim,"Wow!!!! This book kept me on the edge of my seat right till the last sentence. Such a beautiful and dark story. Poignant, yet I could relate to the characters; their pain, hurt and confusion. This is the kind of psychological thriller that I love. This is the kind of book that I wish to write someday. Loved it. "
420,Ashley Stringham,"This book was very compelling. I liked the alternating perspectives, it helped to keep you guessing, always wanting more information. I could have done without the language, though."
421,Hollie,"As posted on: http://www.hollieinwanderlust.co.uk/2...There’s obviously been a lot of hype surrounding this book for quite a while now, and I managed to pick up my copy of it for about a fiver in Tesco a few months back. I put it to one side and it’s only recently when EVERYONE and their dog was reading it that I thought I’d better get my ass into gear and read it before I find myself reading spoilers. I took a few days to get into it, picking it up and reading a few pages at a time when I had a break in the day. I went to Liverpool this weekend to catch up with some friends, and that involved a train ride and two bus journeys totalling a couple of hours worth of travel, and that was all it took for me to get well and truly hooked on the story. I finished it the same night after a solid reading session and have to say that it’s one of the best novels that I’ve read in a long time, and it’s absolutely remarkable considering that this is Paula Hawkins' debut novel. The story revolves around a woman called Rachel, but you actually get to see another two perspectives. We learn that her current state (a woman suffering severely from alcoholism, blackouts and arguably from depression) is one that developed as the result of a number of devastating events. She loses her job and becomes obsessed with watching a couple from the window of the train on her commute to ‘work’ everyday. She notices something unusual one morning, and from this point onwards she can’t help but insert herself into their lives wherever she can. I have to say that I did eventually, around 40 or pages towards the end, guess what was going on but I think that’s just because I drive myself mad with theories whenever I can’t work something out- it really wasn’t obvious and I was still slightly shocked with how everything panned out. I liked Rachel as a character, generally speaking, although I couldn’t really connect with her with regards to the alcoholism- I didn’t have much sympathy because she was aware of how it was doing her no favours, and I feel that aspect was overplayed a little bit. On the other hand, I absolutely hated the character of Anna, I thought she was a really unnecessarily nasty, vindictive character and I felt sorry for Megan for a number of reasons, least of all because of what happened to her. The writing was mature and full of suspense, and it kept me on the edge of my seat. It actually got to the point where I refused to go to sleep because I couldn’t wait to finish the end of it, and that hasn’t happened to me for a very long while. I am really getting into the psychological thriller genre recently and this is definitely one of the best I’ve read- I wasn’t really a fan of Gone Girl, and this has been compared heavily to that (although I really don’t think the plots are all that similar really) so if you enjoyed Gone Girl then you’ll definitely love this. "
422,Mikayla Bond,"4.75 out of 5 starsRachel takes the same commuter train every morning. Every day she rattles down the track, flashes past a stretch of cozy suburban homes, and stops at the signal that allows her to daily watch the same couple breakfasting on their deck. She’s even started to feel like she knows them. “Jess and Jason,” she calls them. Their life—as she sees it—is perfect. Not unlike the life she recently lost.And then she sees something shocking. It’s only a minute until the train moves on, but it’s enough. Now everything’s changed. Unable to keep it to herself, Rachel offers what she knows to the police, and becomes inextricably entwined in what happens next, as well as in the lives of everyone involved. Has she done more harm than good?I listened to this book on audiobook and truthfully, I looked forward to spending more time in the car just to hear more of the story. At first, I hated the characters: Rachel was sad, pathetic, and had no redeeming qualities. She is obsessed with her ex-husband, Tom, who seems reasonable at first and then distasteful, married to an even worse woman. And on and on it goes. No character could have any claims on my favorite, nor could I say I liked any of them. And yet...That is what makes the book so incredible and captivating. Usually it is the characters that drive to finish the story (what will become of such and such?), but this book kept me going with solely the plot. Rachel is a completely unreliable narrator. She's drinking constantly and many times she has no recollection of entire events. The twists in this book seemed to hit me in the face out of nowhere and kept me coming back for more. And the ending... The ending was everything I could have ever hoped for from this book. I am terrible at picking out twists and bad-guys so I had no idea what was going to happen. I found myself bored with Gone Girl, the main character. This book seemed to do what Gone Girl couldn't - keep me going not because of empathy or connection to the protagonist, but because of the plot and resolution.I would recommend this book to any fan of mystery or anyone who thoroughly enjoyed Gone Girl or any book with an unreliable narrator. I would recommend that everyone at least give this book a few chapters try - you'll be hooked!"
423,Salema Nazzal,"What a book! I was totally engrossed in it and stayed up most of the first night as I couldn't put it down. Finished it the next day. I can't find anything negative to say about it, and wish I could write as well as Paula Hawkins. I wanted to read it as it has been such a huge seller, and I was lucky enough to outsell it last year at Haslemere Bookshop with The Folly Under the Lake. However, now that I've read it I have no idea how I managed that as Paula's book is amazing. Looking forward to reading more by this author."
424,Janet Sheffer,"Paula Hawkins could take over the Ruth Rendell throne as best living English mystery writer. The Girl on the Train actually reminds me more of a work by the late Rendell in her Barbara Vine Persona. The characters are well developed and interesting. I figured out who the murderer was towards the end, but it was still fun to see how the person would be exposed and whether there would be any more victims. Now I want to read The Girl Next Door by Rendell and The Child's Child by Vine so I can compare."
425,Veronica Andrew,Brilliant storytelling. Suspenseful. Full of irony and everything that makes for a good read. 
426,Susan Erhardt,This was a very suspenseful read.
427,Tracey,"This book has kept me rivited from the start. It is a fantastic psychological thriller (not my usual genre) and its told in first person narrative by 3 women all of whom are seriously flawed and none of whom you'd want as a friend. The narrators of this story are all 'unreliable' (great word) and the men are no better ! So I felt no love for any of the characters, Rachel a self pitying alcoholic, Anna a smug, attractive housewife who is now married to Rachels' ex and Megan a vivacious blonde with a past but, I did feel drawn in by each of them to know their stories and find out why they were who they were. The book is full of clever twists and turns it's suspenseful and it kept me guessing which is how a thriller should be. The book is going to be made into a film but the setting has changed from England to the US which for me is a shame as it feels like a very English book.Some have said its ""Hitchcockian"" and I think they have a point. I don't think I'll see the film when it comes out, I think I'd rather leave these people as they are, in my minds eye."
428,Coni,A very good read
429,Bernadette Williamson,Wow!All I can say is this book is fantastic. Anything else might give away too much. Edge of your seat reading. You might want to allot a few uninterrupted hours because you won't want to put it down.
430,vvb,"With all the hype, I picked up this one and zoomed it to the top of the reading pile. I was not disappointed.The unreliable narrator made this story more of a mystery to follow. In fact, none of the characters were trustworthy to me so everyone was suspect and unlikable.However, the progressive thriller pacing of the story kept me reading to find out whodunnit."
431,Laura Andersen,"Maybe a 4.5--not life changing, but a brilliant thriller that I read in three hours flat."
432,Sreesha Divakaran," Reviewed in detail on  Rain and a Book  Confession time: I first picked The Girl On The Train up a few months ago and did not finish it then, because I felt it was moving too slow for my tapaula-hawkins-girl-train-sreesha-divakaran-rain-and-bookste. Plus, I assumed it was yet another over-hyped runaway hits. I remember it was being touted as the next Gone Girl or something (for the record, I haven’t read Gone Girl).Big, big mistake, I gotta say! This book is spine-chillingly, goosebumps-rendering-ly brilliant! (apologies for the weird adverbs). I should not have abandoned it the first time.The Girl On The Train is the story of Rachel Watson, who, after going through a bitter divorce, sinks into deep depression and alcoholism. She is fired from her job, but she cannot bring herself to admit this to Cathy, her roommate. So she takes a train to London every morning, pretending to go to work and returns every evening. From the train, she can see her old house, the one she shared with her husband Tom Watson, where he now lives with his new wife, Anna, and their daughter Evie. A few doors down is another house – of a young couple, who look very much in love to Rachel. She observes them every day, names them Jess and Jason. Their real names are Megan and Scott Hipwell. One day, Megan goes missing, and Rachel gets embroiled in the mystery, because she is convinced she knows something about the disappearance, but she cannot piece it together because of memory loss caused by her drinking habit.Read the rest of the review   here ."
433,theresa pitner,"Awesome story It keeps you guessing the whole way. I couldn't put it down! Similar to Gonna Girl, but with a much better twist!"
434,Lorraine Bratcher,Great mystery and page turner!
435,Lindsey Loree,"Critics are raving about The Girl on the Train, and after three days of white-knuckle reading and hastily digested chapters on my lunch break, they are right to be. Author Paula Hawkins throws an alcoholic, makes-all-bad-decisions, divorcee protagonist straight into a train station, where, on that very same night, a woman ends up murdered. Haphazard tendrils and alcoholic recollections connect Rachel to the murder victim in ways that aren’t clear to anyone, not even Rachel herself.Breathless is the best word I can use to describe my physical state upon completing the book; uncertain is the best word I can use to describe my emotional one. The book is written from three points of view, all of which are women’s. There is our main character, Rachel, in addition to the murder victim, Megan, and Rachel’s ex-husband’s new wife (and former mistress) Anna. In addition, Rachel has frequent conversations with her roommate Cathy, and a few run-ins with a woman investigator working on the murder case.I hated Rachel for 99% of this book. Rachel’s character is a case study in unreliable narration, and I bow down to Paula Hawkins’ skills as a writer for executing it so well. I never trusted Rachel’s instincts, or her decision making, and I certainly never trusted her memory. All these things make for a frustrating read as we try to pick apart the truth from Rachel’s observations, and unravel the mystery of Megan’s death.At points, I was rooting for Rachel to let it go. She doesn’t need any more drama in her life, I thought, perfectly content to let this murder mystery end with Rachel attending AA meetings and mending fences with her former employer. But Hawkins doesn’t give us the satisfaction of seeing Rachel clean up her life. Instead she drags us maddeningly down the rabbit hole that Rachel is determined to travel, and we are forced to grit our teeth and have our minds chew on red herring after red herring.I assumed often that Rachel was reading her own emotional state into the murder of a woman she had never even met. All emotions Rachel had toward Megan originated from a fantasy reality she had conjured up during her daily commute past Megan’s house, and envying the seemingly perfect life she lived. In this fantasy world, Megan was “Jess” and her spouse, Scott, was “Jason”. Even after learning the couple’s real names, Rachel slipped back into referring to them as Jess and Jason on multiple occasions.I looked down on Rachel. I had little sympathy for her. Yes her husband left her for another woman, but come on! You have to move on eventually. Instead of pity, I often felt disgust, which is exactly how many of the people Rachel interacted with treated her.Rachel is clearly suffering emotionally on a very deep level, and trying to self-medicate with alcohol. She doesn’t feel she deserves anything from anyone, and she tries to make herself feel “more bad” because she doesn’t think she feels bad enough for all the things she’s done during her drunken black-outs. I allowed her own evaluation of herself to validate my own negative opinions of her.Why didn’t I feel more pity toward Rachel? Why didn’t I trust her more? These are the questions I had to ask at the end of the book. So often women are not trusted to recall events correctly, and have their judgement questioned to the point they no longer trust themselves either. I realized I had fallen into that same line of thinking. I listened to other people’s opinions of Rachel, even though I was perceiving most of this through her point of view.The author makes readers look within themselves and challenge their perceptions of alcoholism and emotional abuse. It reveals the multiple layers of judgement and criticism that victims, disproportionately women, have to dig out from.For all these reasons, and more, The Girl on the Train gets 5 stars from me"
436,Pauline Walsh,Stayed up way too late reading this book! Couldn't put it down. Gripping from start to finish! 
437,Sarah Florimonte,Fantastic!Could not put down! Very thrilling and unpredictable unlike most thrillers. Great pacing and writing. Looking forward to Paula Hawkins next novel. 
438,Betty,Wow! Wishing Alfred Hitchcock was here today... Boy would he have a field day with this one. I could not put this book down and few books grab me like this one did....better than Gone Girl! Great psychological thriller!
439,Lena Varela,"Um enredo muito bem construído. Quando começamos a lê-lo, é muito difícil parar e quando acabamos, ficamos com pena que não continue... "
440,Alicia,"With secrets, betrayals and three unreliable (and unlikeable) narrators, The Girl on the Train is a psychological thriller that’s being compared to Gillian Flynn’s Gone Girl. This intriguing story is set in London where the chronically drunk Rachel spends a daily commute obsessing over her ex-husband and imagining a perfect life-- not for herself but for a younger couple that lives in her former neighborhood. Like Gone Girl Rachel’s narrative and that of her romantic rival just don’t add up. Throw in the perspective of the new young woman on the block and things really get interesting, especially when one of the narrators goes missing. "
441,Anna Boyle,"Excellent, I read it in a day "
442,Nerdy,"Big surprises are ahead if you read the book. Probably it is more my mistake as I did not know that the book is a psychological thriller but it is just about a female weirdo! The book picks up steam half way, clues about past and present lives of the main characters are left at the most unexpected places. Of course, somebody has to die, probably one of the most charming characters. The question ""whodunnit"" remains open until the very end. A little masterpiece in a world with just caring, loving women!"
443,LeeAnn,"I read this in one sitting. I was intrigued and anxious to get the full story. I rarely read secular novels like this as I prefer to read stories that embody healthy marriages and lives. I think our society offers us plenty of unhealthy behaviors and relationships leaving us no need to seek it out in the form of entertainment. I am glad I read this story, though. As a rare treat, I was kept in suspense, anxiously reading!"
444,Heather Gonsoulin,"Did the audiobook. Started slow- but holy moly did it finish with a bang!! Storyline is interesting and the characters well written! Not exactly an HEA, but a stand alone that is worth the read!! "
445,Dey Martin,"THE GIRL ON THE TRAINSorry folks, this is not like the story of Assia Wevill and Ted Hughes where she gasses herself in the oven out of insane jealousy. It is the story of an abused, lonely and pathetic drunk British woman who fantasizes about what she sees - who she sees - in passing apartment windows from her seat on a daily train commute to London. Something she thinks she sees changes her life for ever. Trust me, this is a must read psychological thriller. It moves quickly out of a slightly slow opening chapter or two into a suspenseful who-done-it murder mystery of the highest caliber. It had me completely riveted and waiting for the shoe to drop until the very end. This is a page turner that makes Rear Window seem like a kiddies bedtime story in comparison. Woah! Hitchcockian? Hells yeah! This is also the sad story of black out binge drinking and the trail of hell it leaves for friends and family in its wake. That part of this novel will be hard for those affected by alcohol abuse to take in. But it turns out to be a crucial element. I.e, the story is driven forward as Rachel gradually, desperately tries to recall blacked-out bits of memory that could solve who may have done the murder. It was shocking and very suspenseful to the end and I could not have predicted the outcome. It had me thinking ah..., 'well of course...I should have known it was ____ all along.' The story unfolded in such a way that with each bit of new information offered up, a new suspect came into question and it is masterfully woven together using first person diary-like entries as told by the various players in a crafty timeline. I would say, however, that although brilliant in form, none of the male characters have their own chapters/diaries? This is written by a woman for women in defense of a couple of troubled women I think which is great - I get that. I just want to know why, for example that Scott or Tom or even Kamal or Mac don't get their chance to roll out their own yarn, to come clean in their own words. Was it intentional by Hawkins? Would this have divulged too much and let-on who done it? Are all the men bad guys/abusers in this? Are there no good guys?! Maybe take it up at your book club.In the end I hardly expected that the nearly suicidal, clinically depressed, insecure, multi-personality-like tramp of an alcoholic could go from being the culprit in my mind to being, well, the hero AND a completely turned around sober human being at that?! The police think she's a rubbernecker, a stalker, a nutcase and mentally unstable and they are right. But she is transformed as a victim of circumstance from abused drunk and incredible witness to hero sleuth after being jolted into sobriety. It's a stretch but I guess her recovery is almost believable in the way it unfolds. I loved this book. Five stars. It is a must read. Paula Hawkins has a masterpiece on her hands. Mini-spoiler: Hey, Rachel did actually see Kamal on the porch kissing Megan = Jess. "
446,Fariha.,"I adored this book, way more than I enjoyed gone girl. Paula Hawkins writing is steady but fast, it's thrilling and so intriguing- you are bound to flip to the next page in a mind racing attempt. You will honestly love ""the girl on the train."" "
447,Amanda Absher,Excellent. Suspenseful. Multiple narrators. I really liked this book.
448,Stefanie Johnson,Loved this book all the way through to the end!!!! 
449,Kristen Farragher,"A brilliantly written who-dunnit debut by Paula Hawkins. This book was compulsively readable and fit snuggly in the 'guilty pleasure' category I indulge in every once in a while. I picked the plot twist about three pages before it occurred, so I'd say that the mystery held thick throughout the first three quarters of the novel. Hawkins has a gritty form of crime writing that is reminiscent of Gillian Flynn. Her characters are distantly relatable in a 'I know how the protag feels, but god I could never be that much of a hot-mess' kind of a way. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quick and easy crime thriller, especially for those who loved Gone Girl. "
450,Debi,"This is a great read, and also a great testament for minding your own business! If you want a great end of the school year read...this is it!"
451,Hannah Bradley,"Absolutely amazing. Do yourself a favor and read this book. Read 100 pages in a sitting in the middle of the night and get scared to get up to go to the bathroom. Because this book is amazing, will truly make you think and feel everything Hawkins wants you to feel. It'll keep you guessing and doubting every character until the very end. "
452,Eman Rhaidy,"Just finished reading the book and I have to admit that I learned a lot from the characters, regardless of how horrid and miserable they were throughout the entire book. If you contemplated the events from a positive angle, you'd feel a bit of insight learning about all the things you should NEVER do when you're an adult. The ending was somewhat flat and left me disappointed, which explains what I gave the book four starts instead of five. "
453,Beadyjan,"Completely blew me away - superb psychological thriller. Where do I begin to share my thoughts on this one .... when it made such a huge impact on me? It's the story of Rachel, the girl on the train, who commutes daily, the train journey itself becoming a huge focal point of her days. She watches the same houses as she passes by and recognises certain people so well she feels she knows them - she is the ultimate people watcher and concocts little stories about their lives until one day she witnesses something disconcerting and worrying and feels she must do something - but what? A young woman is missing and because of her observations from the train, Rachel thinks she may be able to throw a little light on what has happened to her. She is used to being disbelieved so is at first reluctant to get involved. As she gets drawn more deeply into the lives of others we realise her own life isn't quite as it at first appears and secrets begin to emerge which threw me time and time again. I had huge sympathy for her situation despite her often being her own worst enemy. This story is so tightly woven it wraps itself around you like suffocating in kid leather. Impeccably constructed and penned with breathtaking intensity.A police investigation is going on around the missing girl and Rachel tries to do her own investigation, but is thwarted time and again and we begin to wonder if she knows more than she is letting on about what happened or maybe she is barking up completely the wrong tree?The story is told in the different voices of 3 women, all a similar age and in similar circumstances yet all very different (and all with hidden flaws) and this technique works incredibly wellUnreliable narrators have become De Rigeur since Gone Girl set the bar and, like gone girl, this work contains several different viewpoints and we don't really know who can be trusted or even who to believe. It sucked me in from the first few words and kept me in a state of nail biting tension throughout.Its a refreshing relief for the women in the story to have such dark and yet very recognisable faults and vices, it makes them so immensely human yet kept me wary and alert all through the book.To say much more would be tantamount to spoilers and I don't want to spoil the pleasure anyone is going to get from reading this - if you like tangled tales, unreliable narrators, apprehension and tension in your stories look no further. The Girl on the train is waiting to blow your mind - go for it!"
454,Jeff Bottrell,"The hype on this novel is so white-hot, meeting my expectations was next to impossible, though I did try to set them at a reasonable level. I was completely prepared to be underwhelmed with some schmaltzy melodrama. Well, I am pleased and awed to tell you that I was wrong in all the best ways, that The Girl on the Train was powerful, tense, and moving. It involves real people with real voices, messed-up, fragile, compromised lives. I will tell you right up front that I experienced this story on audiobook and that the production was absolutely wonderful - three excellent actresses doing stellar work in bringing this world into reader's ears and imaginations. I was particularly impressed with the narrator who read for Megan, and I wish I could mention to you her name to commend her performance, but I'm not certain which of the women it is. They're all great, regardless.Keep your eye on Paula Hawkins because she is absolutely the real deal; it is so astounding to realize that this quality endeavor is her first novel. We are in for so many fantastic reading experiences in our future from this writer! "
455,Suzette,"A thriller to be read and devoured! The writing is interesting and captivating. There is a bit of similarity to ""REAR WINDOW"". Our imaginations are powerful. Page after page, chapter after chapter we learn the strengths and weaknesses of the characters. We determine the killer, we change our mind about the killer. Who is real, who is imaginary, what are the characters motives? So much to lose. Who do you trust. What is REAL, what has been fabricated?If you love a good thriller, grab this one and it will grab you!"
456,Lauralee Woodruff,Compelling read. I'm a fan of tales that weave back and forth in time and between characters. A psychological thriller that kept me guessing long enough to want to read to the end.
457,Brice Meerman,"Yup! Read it. Loved it. Recommend it. Great twists. Kept me up at night forcing me to read one more paragraph. And it kept me up thinking about what just happened or how could so-and-so be so stupid...etc. This book not only entertained me, but also made me feel the story. Wonderfully written and crafted. "
458,Alice,4.5 stars
459,William Torgerson,"Page Turner. I do a twelve hour drive fairly regularly, and I've learned listening to a thriller can be one of the best ways to help the time pass. (Five hours into the nonfiction can make me pretty sleepy.) I had this one on my ""to listen"" list as an audio book, but when I saw it in the local library, I picked it up and read the opening pages. That led to taking it home, and couple of days later I was done. I haven't read a book this fast in many years.This book alters perspectives telling the story from the viewpoint of three women characters. Sometimes I see this as a ""trick"" of sorts for a writer who doesn't have enough material to make a novel go. This story wasn't like that. The structure is interesting and organic to the story. In fact, if I had been writing this book, I'd have been worried how so many of the pages come from one of the three characters' perspective. It was bold and it worked well. So I have a pet peeve against the alternating perspectives but liked this!The book is also about alcoholism and depression and women who are left home all day to take care of their kids. This book is a rich and interesting look at those themes. It's a book where you know from the start that one of the keys to a happy read will be a surprise to the question of, ""Who done it?"" Hawkins does a great job of, at least for me, keeping me off balance until the last pages. I recommend! "
460,Lesley Wickham,"Totally grippingOutstanding psychological novel. The author takes you on a wild journey through the eyes of the three women in the story. Not until near the end does the terrible truth begin to reveal itself. On the way there, you are buffeted by the stories of the protagonists, live their anguish and their hopes, move with them through the landscape of the tale. I haven't been so engrossed in a novel for some time. One of those books you can't wait to finish to find out what happens but then feel devastated that it's over. A masterpiece."
461,LizH,"The girl, Rachel, a raging alcoholic, rides the train everyday to hide the fact she lost her job from her roommate. She gets particularly enamored with a couple she sees each day and makes up stories in her head. She also can't seem to stay out of her ex husbands new life and wife. One day she witnesses a tragedy and believes she can help the police. And she can't stay away.In the beginning and actually through most of it I had a hard time keeping all the characters straight, even though Rachel, Megan and Anna had there own chapters. I really had to pay attention to the date at each chapter and who's it was. That being said, this was an absolute page turner for me. Very well plotted and mixed between reality and not reality. I did not like the mc, so it surprises me I gave it such a high rating, but I just couldn't stop reading this, to find out the truth and maybe some redemption. Very good book."
462,Emilie,The book was perfect written! I loved it! The whole book was very exciting. 
463,Nihan ,"Kitabın karakterleri kendilerini sorunlarında kaybetmiş, yalancı, sadakatsiz ve bencil insanlar. Kadınlar güçsüz, depresyonlarında dibe vurmuşlar. Yani günümüz burjuva bunalımlarını ve acımasızlıklarını tamamiyle anlatmayı başarmış yazar.Tabi sonunda kadın karakterin neden bu kadar kafayı yemiş olduğunu anlıyoruz ve kendi gücünü geri kazanıyor. Olaylar müthiş bir kurguyla anlatılmış ve hem hepsine acıdım hem sinirlendim hem de sempati duydum. Karışık duygulara sürükledi bu kitap beni ve sanırım iyi kitapların yapması gereken şey de bu."
464,Jamee,"I very much liked this book. I don't often give 5 stars. But this book had me hooked almost from the very beginning. I could understand Rachel's POV - the infertility, the severe depression, the alcohol addiction, the getting involved in something almost to just feel normal again. I think she was written this way to be despicable and pitied - but I completely got her. The plot was kept you guessing until the end and I like that too. I figured out the ending just about the same time that the protagonist did. Very well written. I can see why it is compared to Gone Girl, but I think the two are very different from each other. I would recommend this book to those who can understand a character such as what I mentioned above. I believe if you find that kind of habit disgusting or intolerable, then the book won't appeal to you. Also beware that Rachel takes you on her journey of being depressed, so if you are an emotional reader like I am, it's easy to feel the same things for yourself. Don't do it! lol "
465,Claudia,Could not put this book down! All done.
466,Art,"The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins is a stand alone novel of mystery intrigue and thriller variety. Hawkins builds a world that is almost like putting together a jigsaw puzzle or wading through a dense fog. The characters that populate the world both drive the narrative and pop off the page. This book feels like the events that happen in it could happen under anybody's nose. Hawkins reveals her true story thread deliberately slowly almost like peeling an onion. I'm being intentionally vague on the narrative because this book is best discovered while your going through the book. I will say this you won't see the ending coming. Hawkins masterfully hides the ending well. The hype train is big with this book, but I have to say it's one of the corner stone works of our time. The Girl on the Train is a must read five star read!"
467,Brenda,"Rachel is living a lie. Every day she leaves her friend’s home where she has been staying “until she can get back on her feet,”and takes the train into London. Ostensibly she is going to work, but she lost her job weeks ago and now when she gets to London she goes to the library or the park, and buys canned gin and tonics and drinks those until it is time to go home. Sometimes she drinks so much that she loses blocks of time that she cannot account for, a fact that scares her but not enough to stop the drinking. Her friend knows she drinks; Rachel cannot hide the slurred speech or the smell, but her friend doesn’t know about the blackouts or that Rachel lost her job because of the drinking. Rachel keeps meaning to tell her, but her friend’s reaction-the disgust, the impatience, keeps Rachel from saying the words. So every morning, Rachel gets up and gets dressed and takes the train to London and every day on the train she passes the house where this young couple live. She has named them Jess and James and they are all that she is not; young, happy, married and living together in a cute house. They are living the life that Rachel should have had but does not, and every day Rachel fantasizes about their life, projecting all her longings and lost dreams on them and in some strange way it soothes her pain.Then one day from the window of the train she sees Jess kissing another man and soon after that she finds out that Jess has disappeared and the police are now looking for her.Megan, the one Rachel calls Jess, is not living the dream life that Rachel imagines. Although she loves her husband, sometimes she wonders if this is enough. She has also lost her job, but doesn’t know what she wants to do. In the meantime she decides that maybe she could babysit for the couple down the street who have a new baby, giving herself some time to sort things out and talk it over with her therapist.Anna is married to Tom, Rachel’s ex husband. They live in the home that Tom and Rachel lived in when they were married and Anna is now busy making it her own. Their new baby is a symbol of all that went wrong between Rachel and Tom. When Rachel found out that she could not have children their marriage deteriorated and Rachel’s drinking escalated. Rachel still makes drunk calls to Tom which Anna resents enormously and sometimes shows up at the house which terrifies Anna. Although she loves the baby, she is surprised by how much energy and time it takes, so she is relieved to find that Megan, who lives just up the street, is willing to babysit so Anna can have a break.Hawkins is a deft story teller. Although Rachel is an “unreliable narrator,” there is something likable about Rachel and you want to know her story and she makes you understand her pain. As Hawkins shifts from character to character we see what led up to Megan’s disappearance and the interconnections between our characters’ lives. As the story progresses and Rachel’s blackouts play a bigger and bigger role in what happened, the tension rises and each revelation brings you closer to knowing what happened to Megan.Although compared to Gone Girl, I found this book much more satisfying. It is wonderfully written, with characters that are realistic and relatable, Hawkins explores the depths of a woman’s despair, the consequences of trusting too much and you come away with the realization that you never really know what goes on in a marriage or behind closed doors."
468,Ericka Lewis,"I LOVED this book. It had an such an interesting perspective on all kinds of personality disorders, and it kept me until the very end on what actually happened. "
469,Michele,"I couldn't put this book down. Unpredictable, thrilling, and so well written it read like a movie playing in my head. I couldn't wait to get to the end to find out what happened. "
470,alice,"one of the best books i've ever read, hands down. from start to finish, it kept me interested. i thought i knew how it was going to end about four different times and it kept shocking me over and over. the main character annoyed me just a tiny bit but nothing major. seriously, if you liked gone girl, you will devour this book!"
471,Raquel,Great book! Loved the suspense and story!
472,Erin (Paperbackstash) *Proud Book Hoarder*,"“I have lost control over everything, even the places in my head.” A fascinating book as good as its reputation says it is. The dream-like trance the alcoholic protagonist was in led me to feel the surreal experience fully. As she rode the train and fantasized about the imagined lives of the neighbors, while passing by the house of her ex who she obsessed over and wouldn’t psychologically let go of, she fully took me along for the ride in a creative way. I was sucked into her head, even if she repulsed me with her weakness, as she went back and forth from present day to past tense, trying to reclaims memories that would help solve a mystery.The multiple point of book also digs into a few other heads too, the wife she sees through the window and imagines a life for, and the ‘other woman’ that stole her husband from her years before. Their stories merge together.While the story is strong with keeping me glued as to what’s going to happen next, it was a detailed character study more than anything. The protagonist is so weak sometimes she does nauseate, but overall was likeable. Out of all the characters, I disliked Anne the most - ugh. Most of these people were flawed paper people with few redeeming qualities, but it had a realism in the intensity.An unusual, well-done experience. The very end isn't a shocker, but it was a good twist/wrap-up. There are surprises in store for the reader, twists in the almost Hitchcock-type tale, everyday lives made extraordinary when brushed with crime. It works better since the characters aren’t completely likeable, because their realistic flaws make the plot believable. It helps the story is told in patches by characters who aren’t always reliable because of addiction, memory lapses, lies, false motives, and coming from different areas of the playing field.“When did you become so weak?” I don’t know. I don’t know where that strength went, I don’t remember losing it. I think that over time it got chipped away, bit by bit, by life, by the living of it.” If you take away the mystery, the crime and tension, you get a sad drama that tugs on the heart strings and makes the reader emphasize with the characters who dig their own graves. Is it harder to feel sympathy for someone who makes their own mess and keeps sabotaging themselves? In this book, not really; I kept sympathizing while being repulsed as the longer I read about the character, the more I understood the trance-like weaknesses.This is a book I’d recommend for any reader. Whether you’re into drama, horror, suspense, mystery, most of that’s here. The train itself almost takes on its own personality, you get that strong of a feel for the environment these characters are in. The writer is talented and dishes all this out slowly under a druggish haze that heightens the experience. Completely recommended. "
473,Warren,"I don't generally read thrillers, but on the encouragement of Stephen King, I did, gladly! It starts pretty depressingly and if u give it a chance u will be handsomely rewarded!!! "
474,Christina Ferreira,"The most fucked up, captivating and irritating book I have read this year! It took me a while to read because I've been busy revising and whatever but wow, it lures you in and you can't let go of it (even if you try.) It's so thrilling and exciting, you read from all these points of view and you're trying to figure out who's bad and good. It's well written and causes such suspense, by the end of it you realise you're at the edge of your seat. Will leave you shocked and end up giving you goosebumps. Lesson learnt from this book; don't trust anybody, ha. You won't see it coming."
475,Irene McHugh,"Reader beware! Once you start turning the pages of this mystery, you will be hooked. You will neglect other aspects of your life to keep reading. You will require post-reading discussion, so maybe read this book with a friend or book club.The summary of this book introduces the reader to Rachel, a train commuter, who has been watching the same husband and wife on their deck from the train window for months. After she sees something shocking, Rachel tells the police and sets into motion events where she has potentially done more harm than good.The summary compares this store to a Hitchcockian thriller. And there is most definitely a Rear Window aspect to this plot-driven mystery. The narrators are all unreliable in one aspect or another, so figuring out what has really occurred is quite fun.One detail that becomes apparent within the opening chapter is that Rachel has a drinking problem. Her imagination appears overly stimulated. She's escaping into other people's lives because hers is such a mess. However, Rachel is still likable. Aspects of her life are relatable. She thinks things like, ""The sense of shame I feel about an incident is proportionate not just to the gravity of the situation, but also to the number of people who witnessed it.""She knows she has reached a new low. She's not exactly sure how she got here or how to get out of her rut. Even though her life is beyond mundane, I never tired of her narration. Much of the plot hinges on Rachel's perception. Her perception of herself and her perception of the people around her. All of this perception has been influenced by alcohol and her overactive imagination.While Rachel is the main character, if you pick up the book and look over the table of contents, you will see the chapters are broken up into the names of three women: Rachel, Megan, and Anna. The other two women are important to the plot, but their narration doesn't get as many pages as Rachel's does.Having the narration split up amongst these three characters quickly moves the plot along. Unlike other books that change up narrative perspective, I wanted to hear from each woman. Every time. I never dreaded a chapter change because the narration was going to rotate. Instead, each woman reveals details that kept my attention and kept me wondering about what the heck was going on in this seemingly sleepy suburban neighborhood!Around the half-way point of this book, I realized that I was going to have to commit to finishing the story. So many people have compared this novel to Gone Girl that I knew the unstoppable reading point would surface.And it did, around the last fifth of the book. Would I compare this story to Gone Girl?Not exactly. Gone Girl was darker. Much darker. Plus Gone Girl felt more personal because that story centered around the relationship of one husband and wife. The Girl on the Train has more characters from different families interacting, so while it has aspects of the psychological thriller where I kept wondering who did what and why, it wasn't nearly as disturbing as Gone Girl.The Girl on the Train explores how closely neighbors, friends, couples, lovers, husbands, and wives know each other, but at the resolution of The Girl on the Train, the plot strands are nicely tied together. The character who emerges as the antagonist remains a bit of a mystery, as that character should. The rest of the characters move on, and as a reader, I'm not concerned about them at all. They'll all be fine. I walked away from Gone Girl wondering how those characters would continue to exist. Gone Girl is a reading experience that takes the term psychological thriller to new heights of creepiness. While The Girl on the Train isn't nearly as disturbing or creepy, it's still a solid mystery, well worth a read."
476,Kelly Coyle-Crivelli,Like Gone Girl in the way that it explores one of the creepiest marriages on earth :) Think Gone Girl meets Penn Station. Have you ever wondered about the lives of the other commuters?
477,Leighton Minor,"Yeah some of the time you're thinking the story line is crazy or that wouldn't happen in real life. Then you realize you're in the heads of three crazy unpredictable psychopaths and all of a sudden you're into it! Very suspenseful and hard to put down, partially because it's so hard to predict the next step of a jealous alcoholic! Also, great ending. Everyone loves a little justice."
478,Hilary,"Wow. This book made my heart race, had me gasping out loud from shock (my husband kept asking me what's wrong), and gritting my teeth in anticipation. I have Reese Witherspoon to thank for this - she recommended the book on her Instagram account just when I was looking for a new fictional read. Now I am recommending this book to all I know - please read it now, I swear it will get you back into reading if you've fallen off the reading wagon. (I want someone I know to read it so I can discuss my shock and horror with them, because it has the type of plot twists you want someone else to share with you.)This book is being compared to Gone Girl, which I also read and liked, but I have to say I prefer The Girl on the Train to Gone Girl. The Girl on the Train felt a little more real to me and moved at a more rapid pace.Paula Hawkins, can you please write something else? I'll read anything with your name on it now!"
479,Tracy Conner,Had you on your toes to the very end! 
480,Tina,Spooky! Brings new meaning to trainspotting...
481,Janet Cleary,"A riveting page-turner with a ""I didn't see THAT coming"" ending!"
482,Shruti,"One of the most fast paced thrillers I have read. I can't begin to describe how good the book is. It's one of the books where I don't fall in love with any character. And yet, I am unbiased in liking all the characters. I feel warmth, sympathy and excitement as I read each persons part. I can't predict what happens next, and that leaves me flipping pages at a very fast rate. The language is ordinary, but the emotions aren't. This book takes you deep into the psychology of 2 women and it is gripping in the strictest sense. Thank you Paula Hawkins. "
483,Adrienne LaCava,"Psycho thriller murder mystery. Domestic. Like last year's popular Gone Girl, this is a delicious slice of coupling on the edge of sanity. A wonderful, absorbing read! Loved the way Ms. Hawkins drew me into the minds of her people first, revealed their disturbing story slower, like a tease. Ala voyeurs, we watch Rachel ride the train and fake a life and fall off the wagon, to wake up in the gutter. She is not a protagonist easily loved; she is a heartsick voyeur addicted to booze and old secrets. But is her mind or the vodka playing tricks? Could she have blacked out and ... done that? It's hard to tell... "
484,Lee,"Well I read that one fast, for me at least. My favorite books are not usually heavily plot driven, but more reliant on character development. The Girl on the Train shined in both categories. The story moved like a train, slowly at first and picking up the pace until it shot out at lightning speed. I do have to say that none of the characters were particularly likable but the main ones, Rachel and Megan, were fascinating. Quite honestly, Rachel was a train wreck. Having been in substance recovery for many years myself, it was often excruciating to experience her drunkenness so intimately. Fortunately I was a different sort of drunk! So she says. Once I got through the very beginning, there was never a dull moment, and I was surprised by the ending. Great read. "
485,Rachael Ewud-Munkwitz,"One of those rare page turners that you can't stop thinking about. Well-written and well characterized and just ""Gone Girl""-ish enough."
486,Deborah Gordon,I loved this book. I could not put it down. I loved the main character because she was the anti-heroine heroine. You realize that her all togetherness is hidden until a situation arises--a crime--that compels her to dig deep down and be the person she truly is. 
487,Joyce H," """"One for sorrow, two for joy, three for a girl...Three for a girl. I'm stuck on three. I just can't get further. My head is thick with sounds, my mouth thick with blood.""I really enjoyed this book, despite reading some of the negative reviews. I did find Rachel a bit annoying at times, but I loved the characters and their stories. The author did a great job at making these characters believable. I loved that this book was able to keep me on my toes and keep me guessing."
488,Laura (the-bookworm-belle),"We watch stories on the news, and we want to know more about what the reporters tell us, more than even the authorities know more often than not, but I doubt we could ever imagine ourselves being linked to the tragedy. This novel is a story of what happens when you do happen to be linked to one such event. We start off with Rachel, someone who takes the same train day in and day out watches this couple that live a couple doors down from her old house - which her husband and new wife live in, and she imagines this life for them she wish she had, until one day she sees something out of the ordinary. It jumps around a timeline to give you the full scope of the events, and you get to see different points of view from the three women at the heart of it.The Girl on the Train is an intense novel that doesn't ever give, I was completely enthralled all the way through this and barely wanted to stop. The prose is very accessible and the subject matter is one that can be relatable as someone who has ever been fascinated by a particular news story, a person they saw from the distance that one time, or as someone who knows what rock bottom feels like. "
489,Chris,I don't think I've ever read a book this fast. Just over 24 hours in total. (Probably about 6 hours of actual reading.) I think this was better than Gone Girl. The characters were certainly more likable. 
490,Lisa Walter,This story kept me guessing all the way to the end! Incredibly thrilling!
491,Kirsten,"This is great fun and a fast read and I thoroughly enjoyed. I suspected the killer's identity fairly early on, and was sure of it well before the Reveal, but still enjoyed the journey getting there. Definitely fun stuff."
492,Abby,"I wasn't a big fan of the ending because it got a bit hokey and almost every character was acting way out of character compared to how they would act earlier. I understand that the whole plot is built on lies and deceptions, but fairly mundane characters become mustache twirling villains and emotionally dependent liars become the most reliable and levelheaded.But the silly ending can be forgiven because it's quite a ride to reach that point. While there aren't many suspects in the story, the author does a good job keeping the reader guessing and surprised. New clues are revealed and loose ends are tied up very well. The narrators are interesting and the lies they deal with and tell themselves isn't frustrating, but believable.There's a bit to process, but I don't come away confused or disappointed. It's not quite a classic and I can't see myself rereading it now that I know the twists, but that may change over time since you do find yourself flipping back to earlier segments to piece things together. It's worthy of the praise it's been getting, but I can see how it's not for everyone."
493,Arlene Morrell,This book really kept you guessing. 
494,Ruth Boling,"This was one I couldn't put down and read in two days...""what a group of characters, what a situation, what a book"" ( back cover comment). I usually am not drawn to this type of book...a suspense thriller, but read it because it was on the best seller list and a friend highly recommended it. I would suggest watching the time element at the beginning of the chapters because they are not in sequence. This caught me off guard and I was confused for a while. The storyline is heart wrenching, full of much emotion and very raw. I loved it. "
495,Kim Greenhalgh,"Utterly brilliant! I loved The Girl on the Train and the flawed characters within. Not knowing what to expect I was hooked by the premise of a woman on a commuter train seeing something peculiar at one of the houses she passes every day. The story packs a bigger punch once the reader learns more about our commuter, her ex-husband and his new wife, and the couple she nicknames 'Jess' and 'Jason' (because she feels she knows them and their perfect lives given the daily glimpses she enjoys). Things are not as they seem and the tension grows as we learn more.There is nothing to criticize in this rich debut by Ms. Hawkins. The story is taunt, believable (though a stretch at times) and gripping. The characters are troubled, each living with mistakes from the past, and making bad choices that impact others. A truly enjoyable escape read and I couldn't wait to see how it would wrap up. I was not disappointed. This is an exciting read."
496,Camaro,"5 starsDisclaimer! This book is NOT a romance. This is a psychological thriller and it's best if you go in totally blind. Trust me on that one. I knew practically nothing about this book when I started, other than it was literally about a girl on a train (duh!) that gets a little too involved in watching the people living in a house she passes by every morning and evening on her commute. I was blown away by this book. Maybe it was just the right timing, maybe it was just that the book itself was pretty suspenseful. I don't know, but for me, it worked. I'd been in a major book funk. Nothing in the romance genre seemed to hold my interest. I'd DNFd 2 books and barely gotten through another (overly hyped) one and I just did not know what do do with myself. It was through desperation that I finally opened this one, and I'm glad I did because it totally pulled me in from the first page.I honestly can't say much more, for fear of spoiling this. It's one of those books that you need to experience chapter to chapter as the layers slowly get lifted and the mystery revealed. It's a super easy read, written in short chapters that are completely easy to follow despite the number of different characters. The heroine, Rachel was totally relatable, despite being so deeply flawed. Even though I could guess the ""big reveal"" by 80%, I think that was intentionally done by the author, so we could get the full effect of the comeuppance the ""villain"" had coming. I can totally understand the hype surrounding this book, although I don't know how it compares to Gone Girl as I haven't read that one (or watched the movie). But if you want something different, outside the romance genre, something like a palate cleanser if you will, then this is an excellent option. I honestly couldn't put it down, and kept wondering what was real and what was imagined. It made me think about the way we view people. Who hasn't wondered about perfect strangers in the street, or on the subway or bus, thinking that they have a perfect life, and yet no one knows the dark, deepest secrets we keep, sometimes not even the people closest to us.5 awesome stars and totally recommend you read absolutely NO spoilers if you plan on tackling this one. ~ "
497,Corey,"I really enjoyed this literary murder mystery! I’m so glad that I jumped on the band wagon and ordered it from my public library, then waited ~4 months until my turn came up for a digital copy.In this story, Rachel rides the train to work and back every day on the same route. At the beginning of the book, Rachel is an emotional wreck who has recently been divorced and replaced in her marriage and in her marital home. She spends her commute drinking and creating fantasy narratives about people that she sees along the train route every day, including a young couple who have recently moved in a few doors down from her old home where her husband still lives with his new wife and baby. One day the wife of the young couple goes missing under suspicious circumstances and Rachel finds herself inextricably tied up in the story and in the lives of the people involved. Due to her mental state at the time, she makes one bad decision after another, becoming more and more deeply involved in the situation, despite her lack of a direct connection to the case. The mystery unfolds and is very clever and dramatic.This would definitely make a good movie, which I’m sure it will be soon. Compared with Gone Girl, I would say that this one was definitely a simpler story and I think I actually enjoyed Girl on the Train more. There was less suspension of disbelief necessary and it wasn’t outright scary for the most part. Despite the simplicity of the story, the literary technique of the unreliable narrator kept me guessing because I couldn’t see the whole story from a bird’s eye view until the narrator herself began to see things more clearly. Very well done!"
498,Andrea Rumpler,"I've been up until midnight the last two nights finishing this book. Once I got past the halfway point, I couldn't put it down! I loved the character build-up, and the plot kept me guessing and made me feel like anything was possible. In the end, the surprises kept coming until almost the last page. There were about 5 different times throughout the book that I was convinced I'd figured it all out, only to be thrown another curve again and again. Highly recommend this book (unless you enjoy getting to sleep at a decent hour...in that case, save this one for vacation or a weekend). Great read. "
499,Caleb Edison,"READ THIS BOOK! You will not be able to put it down! It will keep you guessing on the edge of your seat all the way to the end! I have no doubt that ""The Girl on the Train"" will be adapted into a major motion picture. If you are a fan of ""Gone Girl"" this is the book for you! I wish I could give it more stars! "
500,Cristal {Hummingbird},"Seriously compelling, ridiculously addicting, and so very fucked up.The Girl on the Train was one of the most fun books I’ve ever read. I know, fun isn’t the first word you’d associate with a book like this, but I was lit with excitement by the time I got off this crazy ride.This book featured one of the most fascinating characters I’ve ever read. Rachel is fascinating like watching a building collapse is fascinating. I don’t think I’ve ever cringed or screamed more at a character. I’ll give you some details about the events in this book, though not too much, but seeing as this is a mystery, I think the details should remain such.Rachel is a sad, sloppy shell of a woman who spends most of her life watching the lives of those around her. She used to be different, but now her days roll by without anything to mark them. Until she sees something she shouldn’t and becomes involved in the lives of the people she used to watch from afar. I loved Rachel. I felt for her, I was scared for her, I pitied her, and I rooted for her, even though sometimes I wanted to turn my back on her. But I could never leave her alone. She was that friend who exasperated me as she did stupid shit over and over again, but I stuck by her because I knew that she could be better.The novel is told mainly from her POV, along with two other women, and through their eyes the reader sees each clue to the puzzle. I loved the format for this book. Its nonlinear plot confused me and spun me in all directions until I had no idea what one was north. The mystery was truly absorbing, made even more so by the fact that the main character’s observations were unreliable. I had so much fun trying to see through the mucky facts, but that wasn’t even the best part of the book to me.I loved the characters most. They were so engaging and well developed, each one evoking strong feelings from me. There wasn’t a redundant one in the bunch. This wasn’t suspense that relied only on the unsolved mystery and the plot to thrill and captivate. The characters pulled me in and each one made me feel like I was living their life, which made what was going on between the pages seem so real.Paula Hawkins created a novel that had movement. At no time while I was reading did I feel like I was sitting still. I recommend this to any reader, regardless of which genre they love. This is simply a great book with skillful writing, layered characters, and an exceptional story. I just finished it and I already want to read it again."
501,thegirlwhoreadssbooks,"OMG! This book was so addictive! I couldn't stop reading the 100 last pages. I thought for myself ""I want to know. I WANT TO KNOW!!"".Someone said me that the ending of the book was a little predictable, but I don't think that. In the last chapters, even before the last Megan's Chapter, I started to connect all the details, till I found out who was the Megan's murderer. I don't think that the ending of the book is predictable (it's my opinion, of course). It could be predictable if in the end, the Megan's killer was her husband or Abdic. I think that Paul Hawkins had the talent that most of the Thriller's authors don't have: She made me think of all the possible options, that in the end, any of them were true. So, I loved it. I hope that in the future, this book can be adapted into a movie. "
502,Margaret Madden,"Rachel is on a downward spiral. Her marriage has broken down, she has lost her job and her drinking is more than a small problem. Taking the commuter train to London, at peak times, each working day, she watches the world go by, rather than confronting it. As she observes the same people, in the same houses, each day, she begins to form a picture of them in her mind. Their names, their jobs and their routines. The fog of alcohol helps bring these people to life, for her, and when she hears that a young woman that she he has been watching, has disappeared without trace, the reality of what she has witnessed hits her with a bang. The only thing is, with a reputation as a drunk, prone to mental breakdown, will anyone believe her?This debut novel is creating a lot of discussion at the moment, although not released until Jan, the reviewers have given it a resounding thumbs up. I agree. An addictive read from page one, Rachel is a character that demands attention. Her descent to her current level is drip fed to the reader and the pity, shame and despair that she feels is palpable. She is a victim of circumstance and there but for the Grace of God go I...The unsuspecting 'actors' in her real life play are only seen for a few minutes each day, but she feels a connection to them, makes them part of her journey and her routine. The past is interlinked with this street and the alcohol keeps her connected more than she should be. Prone to blackouts after some of her drinking sessions, Rachel struggles to piece together the weak parts of her memory that may contain information about Megan, the missing girl, and the night she disappeared. Did she witness something or is it all related to her depressed and drunk state? The standard of this novel is high. Way high. Much stronger than Gone Girl, paced at break neck speed, hidden stories and twist and turns throughout. For fans of Into The Darkest Corner and Before I Go To Sleep, it is a superb psychological thriller, with hints of classic black and white Hitchcock movies throughout. A perfect way to escape reality, and may make you look at your fellow commuters in a new light. Sure to be a massive bestseller!"
503,Gully Ditta,"Before going into this, I should highlight that I listened to an audiobook with amazing narrators, and that could have contributed towards the high rating!I thoroughly enjoyed this novel, though I know a lot of people felt otherwise. I loved the narration: in the beginning, I felt like an outsider peering into the deepest recesses of Rachel’s drunken-creepy-obsessive-disturbed consciousness. I liked how the different narrators didn’t sugar-coat their feelings and expressed them candidly. The unreliable drunken narrator was definitely one of the highlights of this novel. (I suspect the author, Paula Hawkins, made those train journeys that her character Rachel did, while sipping pre-mixed gin and tonics!) Much to my embarrassment, I could associate with Rachel’s drunkenness—though hopefully that makes me a typical Londoner in his twenties! Anyway, Rachel, who appears to be a self-loathing, snooping, anti-hero ends up becoming the hero of the novel—which I very much liked. I also think the characters were believable: ranging from Megan, who suffered from anxiety and lacked direction, to the overly concerned not-so-best friend Cathy, to Tom, who wins the award for being the ultimate douchebag.All in all, a great mystery-thriller, and I look forward to reading more novels like this (Gone Girl, here I come!)."
504,Krystyna,Page turning fast read! The change in perspectives through out the story adds a great element to the story.
505,Westerville,"As a reader you taken down a rabbit-hole of lies, betrayal, and guilt. There is red-herring after red-herring. - Kaya, Adult ServicesReserve a library copy."
506,Lynne,"The moment I finished this book, I said ""wow"". This is the best novel in any genre I've read in a long, long time.The story revolves around Rachel, who takes a commuter train every day and notices a couple she calls Jess and Jason, whose home backs onto the train track. Along the way, we learn about Rachel, her present and past life, and ""Jess and Jason"". The stories are woven together seamlessly, with a growing feeling of inevitability. The author's talent for telling a story is impressive.We learn that Rachel is a mess. She is so flawed, you have to feel terrible for her. She is lonely and isolated and damaged, but finds that she is not ready to stop fighting her demons. I like how complex she is, how fragile and yet still alive. I really cared about her as I read this book. She makes so many mistakes, and during the story she becomes more aware of them and what she needs to do to stop making them. Other characters are layered, surprising, and complex as well, though I won't say more as I don't want to spoil the read for anyone.The story is a thriller, a whodunit of the very best kind. There are red herrings and plot twists and dark back stories. Yes, I figured out who did it before the final reveal, but that was because the author led me there intentionally. And even so, there were surprises and revelations right up to and including the final page.Various points of view and a shifting timeline are used to tell the story. The chapters are mostly short, with dates and names to help the reader. I thought this was an extremely effective tool. It kept the story just flying along, and it casually dropped shocking bits and pieces of characters' lives on the reader in totally believable ways.In reviews, this book has often been compared to Gone Girl. There are some similar plot points, and they have the shifting narrative point of view in common. In my opinion, The Girl on the Train is by far the superior story, told by a far superior author."
507,Kelly Butcher,"I love books that are told by multiple narrators- especially when you know that those stories will intersect one another at some point in the story-- it is the waiting for that intersection to occur that gets me every time. It is like looking down on a road, waiting for cars (or trains) to collide with one another. This book was artfully written- and the moment when the narrator's stories connect is perfect. When I figured out who the bad guy/girl was, I almost dropped to my knees. I was doing dishes and listening to the book- and that moment when my brain clicked all of the pieces together, it literally took my breath away. That... that is what makes a good book. "
508,Erin Clemence,"I read “Girl on the Train” simply on recommendation and the fact that everywhere I looked, I saw or heard about Hawkins’ novel. So due to its popularity, I thought I’d give it a shot. Am I ever glad I did. “Girl on the Train” tells the story of Rachel, a daily commuter who, while riding the train one day, witnesses an event that changes the lives of not just herself, but of several others. This book has been compared to “Gone Girl” and it is an accurate comparison. This book has the jerk husband (more than one actually in this case), the missing wife and the speculation that Flynn’s novel has; as well as the suspense and the gripping storytelling. The characters are compelling and dysfunctional, which adds such a powerful emotional component to the story. I actively hated Anna for the majority of the book (right up until the end in fact) and when a reader holds such a strong opinion of a character, you know the writer has some insane talent. To think that this is Hawkins’ first novel is surprising- however I am happy to hear this because it means that I did not miss any of her previous works. I will be lining up, alongside everyone else, to read anything else she creates"
509,H.,"Wow. This one was a wild ride from start to finish. The trio of women at the heart of this book, Rachel, Anna, and Megan, are all unreliable as narrators. The first is a blackout drunk, the second is a former mistress gone domestic, and the third is a serial cheater. Between the three of them, we get a story that is deliciously jumbled and fractured, and the truth is wonderfully hard to figure out. Literally every single one of the ensemble cast is messed up in some way. You'd be hard-pressed to find a single positive character in this book. I think it's safe to say there are, in the end, three couples in the centre of this book: Rachel and Tom (divorced), Tom and Anna (married with a baby), and Megan and Scott (married). Each brings their own set of problems to the table and each is absolutely vital to the story. None of them are trustworthy, though. At its core, The Girl on the Train is a book about love gone wrong. You can see it in Rachel, can see it in Megan, can see it in Scott, can see it even in Tom. It's a book about suspicion, and jealousy, and desperation, and rage. It's a book about loss, too, but it's also about the fact that you can't truly know someone just from glimpses into their life. In the same vein, it's a book that says you don't know the person you love the most as well as you think you do. It's quick-paced and written relatively to-the-point, so it's an easy, enjoyable read.As a quick end-note, I absolutely love the e.e.cummings reference quite at the start of the book, and I love how it fits into the story like a charm:
Life is not a paragraph, and death is no parenthesis.
"
510,María,"5 de 5 estrellasNo voy ha decir demasiado sobre él porque no se debe, hay que subirse al tren, mirar bien por la ventanilla y descubrir que sucede en el trayecto. Ha sido la novela del verano para mi. Si quieres sentir emoción, intriga y leer una buena historia, a por él. "
511,Kim Kudla,Loved it!!
512,Alison Winter,This is nothing like I normally read but I thought it was brilliant.
513,Kristy,This book was hard to put down! Rachel you feel sorry for but are also angry with-strange kind of character that is hard to cheer on. Spellbinding. When traveling I often wonder about the homes I pass and the people who live in them. This added whole other twist to your imagination.
514,Atrapada Enunashojasdepapel,"La trama está muy bien hilada, y no sobra ni un solo párrafo. La historia es tan buena, que a veces perderás la noción del tiempo mientras lees. No quiero contar más, puesto que es una novela de intriga y misterio, con grandes dotes de suspense. http://www.atrapadaenunashojasdepapel..."
515,Krista,"Wow, I couldn't put this one down until I was finished. Great book! "
516,Aaron,"Rattled through this book in a day. Just could not bring myself to put it down. Ate, drank coffee and smoked cigarettes, all the while turning pages compulsively to see what happened next. Haven't read a book this good in years. Wish I'd never read it so that I could read it again without knowing the plot. Loved the style and pace of the novel, loved the characters, loved the plot. Felt very real, totally authentic. Can't think of any real criticism, which for me is rare.A totally unexpected gem. If you like psychological thrillers, I'm pretty sure you'll love this."
517,Jeannette,Phenomenally written. Best plot twists I've read in quite some time. 
518,Kristi,"I really wish I could give half stars. I feel like this was a 4.5 ... leaning toward a 5. I listened to the entire book in less than 48 hours during a camping trip. I got it as a free download and figured I'd give it a shot, though with all the hype about the book, I actually didn't know anything about the story. I'm really glad I didn't because I enjoyed letting the story unfold. It was unpredictable, frustrating, compelling, amazing. A great modern mystery. I really enjoyed the audio experience for the most part. The readers for Rachel and Megan were good, though the voice for Anna didn't work for me. I think what I missed about the audio vs. a print copy, though, was the ability to work out the timeline for myself. There were times when the women's narrations matched up and overlapped. And then there were times when they did not, and it took me a while to figure out that one person was narrating in March while the others were narrating in July, for example. "
519,Martha,"Page turner. As wild a read as ""Gone Girl."""
520,Julie Kennelly,Wow ! I absolutely loved this book - I had to stop myself from reading it in one sitting - it's totally gripping a real page turner - I really liked the way it was written from the 3 women's perspectives and loved the way the story unfolded giving just enough glimpses to keep you second guessing right up to the end - this is a must read for anyone - best summer read so far - excellent book 
521,Mary Alice Sexton,"Loved it, Loved it, Loved it! Psychological thriller. Could not put this book down, finished it in 2 days. I loved this book so much that I am anxious that my next read is not going to hold my interest! Going to change the genre to historical fiction because there is not another book in this genre that will be an equal match. Loved it! (Did I say that already?!)"
522,Sarah Morton,"I suppose we're all unreliable narrators of our own lives. Ask 10 witnesses what they see and you'll get 10 different answers. Over time, our memories shift like tectonic plates, so slowly that we don't realise we're creating our own version of the truth. It's human nature, which makes unreliable narrators the most terrifying of protagonists. They jump out of the page like new friends, drawing us into their deepest thoughts and sometimes making us forget that we don't really know them at all.Hawkins' debut novel is astonishingly good and features all the hallmarks of a master thriller. Much like Gone Girl, the story revolves around a missing wife and the dangerous question 'what really happened?' But that's where the comparison ends. The Girl on the Train is executed with far more intensity, the tension building amongst the trio of unreliable narrators, until we can't be sure what to believe anymore. Hawkins has certainly set the bar high for thrillers in 2015. I can't wait to see what she comes up with next."
523,Menna Ashraf,"Wow. Just wow. I don't usually read thriller, but that was so much worth it.I have a love-hate relationship with this book. Everything about the character is absolutely repulsive. They're so repulsive that I've eventually pitied them. Especially Rachel—I pitied her so much. She's so pathetic, but I sympathized with her. I HATE TOM. He's so infuriating. I was so happy with the ending. It was the poetic justice I anticipated. I really liked the writing style and the thrilling vibes. Overall, I loved it. But hated the characters, that's how I know the author succeeded."
524,Gina Wade mcdonald,"excellent, I lost sleep to finish this, totally unique and unpredictable"
525,Michelle Mcallister,Awesome book!Lots of twists and turns keep you on the edge of your seat until the end. I could not put the book down!
526,Sylwia,"http://sylwiasbookshelf.com/the-girl-...As you might have guessed the book is about a girl on a train :) Every day she takes the same train and stares into the windows of the same house. Until one day she sees something terrible, which she can’t keep to herself. Sounds a bit creepy? It did to me, and that’s why it got my attention, I was really curious about what Rachel saw. What could she have seen that was so horrifying? And then I got to the part where she sees it, and I thought: well, it’s not really that terrible. But it was what happened next that was truly terrifying. How it would change her whole life so dramatically that she would never be able to forget it.Paula Hawkins introduces a few different characters who, seemingly, are not connected at all. You might think they’re just part of a side plot, but she has a plan for every one of them, At first it seemed like I had everything figured out and nothing was going to surprise me, and then Paula delivers a massive twist that I haven’t seen coming at all!. Now when I think of it after I’ve read the book, it was kind of obvious, and couldn’t have been any other way. But she so skillfully diverted my attention to other details, that I was really stunned by the sudden change of events!Throughout the book the story is very well paced with a lot going on and a lot to think about and try to figure out. As is the case with most books, there’s just a a bit in the middle where the story slows down a bit. But do not quit there! It’s just a devious trick by Paula just so she can take you by surprise with a twist a couple of chapters later… A bit of the ‘calm before the storm’ idea, so keep reading!"
527,Mary Ann Heinsman,"All is Not as it SeemsA girl on a train, a perfect couple, a horrible crime, secrets and lies. Many, many lies. Unable to cope with her past and her current situation, Rachel Watson invents a fantasy life for a young, vibrant couple that she observes on her daily train commute into London. An alcoholic, Rachel's obsession with this couple fills the emotional void in her life and the alarming gaps in her memory. When a horrible crime rocks her small suburb, Rachel must face her demons in order to learn the truth. But exactly what is the truth and who, if anyone, is telling it? Paula Hawkins weaves a complicated web of deceit in which all the players see the same events through their own clouded perceptions. The reader is kept guessing as Rachel is drawn further and further into the mystery and each character's secrets are unraveled. And everyone, including Rachel herself, is lying to protect their darkest truth.In the same vein as a Hitchcock movie or a Gillian Flynn novel, The Girl on the Train is filled with suspense and twists. The reader's loyalty shifts from one character to the next at the hand of Hawkins' masterful storytelling. Her characters are deeply flawed, yet extremely compelling. Although I found Rachel to be loathsome at times, I was rooting for her to overcome her personal battles and find peace. "
528,Elena,"Muy bueno,nada mas comenzarlo me ha enganchado y no podía parar de leer. Evitaré spoilers para no desvelar nada sobre la trama.Sólo decir que lo recomiendo a todo aquel que les gusten los libros de suspense."
529,Nique,"Talk about a page-turner! I got to the point where I never wanted to stop listening to this book. Every time I thought I had it figured out, something else surprised me. The characters are incredibly interesting, and I like that they are not one-dimensional. "
530,Pamela Scott,"The Girl On The Train is a great thriller, packed with twists and turns and complex characters. There is a lot of hype about this book. I don’t pay attention to hype or use it to make judgement about books. I wanted to read this because it sounded right up my street – the kind of thriller I love. I was right. The book exceeded my expectations. I thought the characterisation was brilliant. The book is narrated from the point of view of three women; Rachel, the girl on the train who’s unemployed and has a serious drink problem which has gotten worse since her husband left her for someone else two years before; Anna, the woman Rachel’s husband left her for and Megan, the woman Rachel watches from the train and projects her happiness fantasies onto. Rachel is my favourite character, she’s so messed up, holding onto her sanity by a thread and wonderfully real. I really like the way the book moves between the viewpoints of these three women so you get to see what’s going on from different angles. This can work really well and the author pulls it off. As for the plot? I thought this was a great, original thriller. There was so much going on. This one of those books where the author makes you think about twenty different things are going on and when the truth is revealed at the end of the novel it’s the opposite of what you’ve thought all along. I absolutely love it when an author surprises me. I loved The Girl On The Train."
531,Maggie Doerle,If you like psychological thrillers you must read this. Unputdownable!
532,Robbie Crowley,SO GOOD! 
533,Mark Laumakis,"10X Better Than Gone GirlThis is the best book I've read in 2-3 years (and I read 60+ books per year). Terrific plot, engaging characters, wonderful writing -- this book has it all.Read it now. You'll be glad you did!"
534,Marie Cheek,"The Girl on the train had my complete attention! The story is narrated in first person by three women whose lives cross. The main character is Rachel, an extremely flawed woman who drinks so much that she has blackouts. When she reports an important finding related to a missing woman, she is not taken seriously. After one of her many blackouts she thinks she saw something significant, but just can't remember. Her struggles to try and reclaim that memory puts her in progressively worsening danger. I really loved the suspense and the unpredictability of the story. The characters here believable...especially Rachel and he alcoholism. It's one of those books that's keep you in suspense until the very end. I highly recommend it."
535,Jean,Loved it! Very suspenseful and characters that were interesting. Similar to Gillian Flynn - read it in three days because I couldn't put it down!
536,Romany,"Great book, in the same way that Gone Girl was a great book. Read it straight through cover to cover in two days. Gripping storyline follows a woman, her ex, his new wife, and the neighbors down the street. But who dunnit?"
537,Lucy Barker,"This book was everywhere months ago, so not wanting to miss out on the latest great thing, I ordered a copy from the library. In my current assignment-laden state I only read about the first chapter before it was due back. It took me a while to decide whether I would attempt another request. Rachel, the main character whose perspective we begin with is really disconcerting, I wasn't entirely sure I wanted to inhabit her brain again.I finally had another crack and all I can say is, brilliant. With a motley cast of characters whose behaviour and motives are very slippery, it kept me hooked (second time around!) It sort of vaguely sits in the same genre as ""Gone Girl"" although in a very British rather than American way.Worth reading if you don't mind a little bit of gritty in your fiction."
538,Toni,"Fast paced, once I figured out who the villain was, I had to race to get to the finale!"
539,Clinton Sweet,"Immensely enjoyed this and really struggled to put it down. I was engrossed by the intrigue right from the start, constantly re-guessing possible outcomes. "
540,Nasira K,"It started a little slow for but only a bit.. Sometimes only details do that to me, when nothing is happening. But I believe those details are necessary for us to understand everything before anything major happens so I kept going. After a few chapters, it was nearly impossible for me to put the book down. This book made me stay in one place for 5hours until I finished the entire thing. I generally do not like unstable or sad, depressed main characters and I still couldnt stop reading this. The ending of course blew me away!! I cannot wait for the movie! I was jumping up and down when I found out. I loved the style in which the story is written. It goes back and forth between what happened before and what's happening now which I think is a major reason why it hooks the reader to the book LOL. We all wanna know what it was that happened back then. Ughhh. Anyway, it's been a loooong time since I liked a book this much. I'll definitely be looking for the author's other books. "
541,Tazitazitazi,"Popularne knjige me obično razočaraju, ali ova nije. Ima izvrsnu krimi radnju (ispričanu iz prvog lica od strane tri ženska lika), odlično razrađene likove (sa svim vrlinama i manama), odlično pogođen tempo (bilo mi je neobično da se treći lik pojavljuje tako kasno, ali se to pokazalo opravdanim). U svakom slučaju izvrsna knjiga."
542,Gina Hudson,"new favorite author. can't stop reading this book, can't wait for new ones from the this author"
543,Lisa Winter,great read!Great suspense! Loved it! Kept my interest till the end. Would recommend to anyone especially those who liked Gone Girl.
544,Jose,"Good thriller of the domestic kind. Page turner not only because of the well paced unfurling of the mystery but also because of the unpretentious writing. The portrayal of the main character as an alcoholic and depressive, as well as her yearning for an alternative sounded plausible for t he most part. "
545,Lisa  Welch,Good read! This would make an excellent movie too! (if it's done right that is)
546,Karen Naylor,"Let me first get this out of the way: “The Girl on the Train” by Paula Hawkins is this year’s must-read book.Very soon, the innards (and outards) of this debut novel will be covered in praise-filled quotes written by successful mainstream writers and glossy magazine editors (the magazines being glossy, not the editors). And once it enters the Oprahsphere ... well, we all know what happens then.You’ll buy it / download it / borrow it / whatever it. Maybe you’ll even read it while you are commuting on the train. (Would that be ironic or coincidental? I always get those confused.)But, bottom line, and all cliches aside, you’ll read “The Girl on the Train” and you’ll like it. And not in that overcooked, unbuttered Brussels sprouts kind of way.It’s the story of Rachel, a drunken ex-wife whose bitterness is all-consuming. Then there’s Anna — she’s the reason Rachel is an ex-wife. Finally, Megan, who consumes Rachel and pisses off Anna. Sounds like a fun bunch, huh?These women are three of the most unlikeable people you’ll ever meet. They are not welcome at your girls’ night out. They will, however, still manage to ruin your weekend plans. “Sorry, no can do,” you’ll mumble as you click your way through your Kindle, drawn in by Hawkins’ intricate crafting of a story that hits those trigger points that catapult a novel to the top of the best-sellers list.Rachel, a rapid-fire, gin-and-tonic lush with wanderlust, commutes to London via train every day. Along the way, she watches Megan, for whom our traveler has created this fantasy life. They’ve never met, their lives separated by the train’s window. It’s in that driver’s seat of sorts that Rachel’s given Megan a made-up name (Jess) and made-up life (perfect), fueling her “what if” mantra and allowing her some control over her out-of-control existence.But Rachel’s fantasy has seismic faults.Megan (aka Jess) has a real life, living a few houses away from Anna, you know, the (insert derogatory noun here) who stole Rachel’s husband and who in someone else’s novel surely would wind up dead. But that would be too simple, too Lifetime movie-ish, here. Instead, Hawkins dumps Megan’s corpse in a park and it’s then that things get ... well, weirder.Rachel, no longer the voyeur, slides into sleuth mode, inserting herself into the world she is no longer — and hasn’t been for some time — welcome. Into this turmoil, Hawkins offers up a couple of seemingly nice — but deep down, you know they’re twisted — husbands, as well as a therapist who probably could use a self-help book.Add those slices of lime to Rachel’s gin and tonics, and — voila! — you’ve got yourself ordering another round from Hawkins."
547,Mindy Jacobs,"This book kept me guessing throughout. I thought I had it figured out, but the twists and turns just kept coming. I liked how bits and pieces of each character's history were revealed throughout the story. Having lived in Chicago, I totally get the fascination with seeing people and their homes as you speed by on the train. I know a lot of books these days are written from the perspective of several different characters, but I do enjoy that. You're able to gain a better understanding of the different characters. If you enjoyed Gone Girl, you'll love The Girl on the Train!"
548,Grass monster,"I read this a couple of months ago just because of all the hype surrounding it. This is not my usual style of book but i gave it a go. This is the first book i have read by Paula, certainly not the last.I finished this in a day, i could not put it down & even cancelled my lunch date so i could finish it (oops) This was an excellent storyline that was filled with many twists & turns. Untill near to the end i could not see where this was going. Boy have i not read a book like this in a long time - if ever!!. Loved the charactors throughout and i really felt i had jumped into the story. Would reccomend this to anyone."
549,Taylor Hondos,"I really wasn't impressed with this book to begin with. I found myself rolling my eyes at it saying ""why do people like this?!"" Then something changed. It became a WONDERFUL read. I loved it. I was confused. I wanted answers and boy was I SURPRISED. "
550,Melissa,I loved this book! Couldn't put it down and finished it in 2 days!
551,Libby Broadbent,"Fast, compelling, scary. Its everything everyone is saying about it."
552,Krissy Ronan,What's better than a couple snow days and a book that sucks you in? Not much. Great mystery that kept me completely enthralled. I even wanted to read it while sitting at stop lights. 
553,Staci Criswell,"There is this place...in all of our lives...where we begin to wonder if everything we thought were true, and real, becomes an illusion! That is where this book takes you! Great read...great thriller! Highly recommend for female readers who enjoy suspense.""We are tied together forever: bound by the stories we told"""
554,Traci,"READ THIS BOOK! What a fantastic ride it was! Excellent plot, amazing twists in the story, strong characters, perfect ending, fantastic writing, all wrapped up in a 316 page package. I thoroughly enjoyed watching Rachel's personal journey and cheered every realization she had about herself and the mystery she found herself tangled up in. Though I did figure out whodunit (normally, this drives me nuts), I was caught by surprise by the revelations of which events were real and which weren't. I want everyone to read this book so we can discuss it! "
555,Rebecca Griffin,Really great book! You keep thinking you know what's next and it surprises you. I like being surprised at the end. Such a well thought out plot. Very thrilling I didn't want to stop. 
556,Andrew,"Easily one of the best books I've read lately. Or ever.I loved this book!While it's my general nature to cast a skeptical eye towards anything that seems overly ""popular"", in this case I must conclude that sometimes the ""it"" book is ""it"" for a reason.As mysteries go it was so refreshingly un-mystery like, devoid of the usual cliche devices so often used to advance a murder plot. What a story! Pathos, really, which I found very intriguing and unique. So engrossing that I almost forgot there was a mystery to be solved. That's really saying something.The main character is incredibly flawed (heads up, if that's not your thing) in a way that made it, to me, very interesting. Really a different sort of main character in a mystery, with a really different angle on reaching a solution which, let me tell you, is spellbinding!If you see this book compared to Gone Girl, consider that apropos only in that they are each fantastic books. The Girl on the Train is every bit its own. And great.Five, yeah, Five Stars. (UCBC Rating 4.87)"
557,Kclopton,Loved it! I'm guessing it will be in the theaters soon. 
558,Barbara Kinsky,"This has to be the thriller of the year! It keeps you gasping for air with all the twists and turns. Even though I was right quite early on who the killer was, it was still interesting to see how it got to that point! Highly recommended!"
559,Jasmine Morgan," The Girl on the Train is a compelling novel written by Paula Hawkins. It depicts the story of Rachel, Megan, and Anna; three women intertwined by the same man. The reader first meets Rachel, the girl on the train who takes it every morning and watches her Jess and Jason sit on their porch as the train passes by. One Morning, Rachel watches Jess as she stands up to passinotley kiss a man who isn't Jason. The next morning, Jess is missing. As Rachel tries to find out what happened to Jess, Hawkins tells a thrilling adventure of loss and love and hurt and sorrow. The Girl on the Train is such an outstanding debut novel that it will leave the reader craving more. I rated this book 5 stars because it is very well written and I absoulutley enjoyed it. I am really stunned that this is Hawkins' first novel because it is amazing! The plot, the switch from charcter to charcter, the dynamics, the story line; AMAZING¡!¡ I also really enjoyed how Hawkins finished off the novel. She left the reader with just enough closuer and just enough room for imagination. I would reccomend this book to those who espically liked Gone Girl and to those who want a good read."
560,Olesia Snezhkova,"Honestly, I think it's one of my favorite books so far. And it's not thriller, mystery part of this book that makes it special. That makes it intriguing and keeps the focus of the book. But it's something else... Detailed description of pain, of misery, of abandonment are the core points of this book.The topic of this book is so deep that I'm not surprised that some readers cannot appreciate it fully. It's not an action book. It's like a confession. It is a way to look into lifes of others. No wonder some people are trying it out, never going onto all its depth and criticising the book. It's purpose is far from just being one more exciting and fun read.It touches sacral - humans misery and pain. It's not ment to be amusing. It meant to be revealing.For me it's a masterpiece."
561,Madalena,"Tudo neste livro é excelente. A capa, a escrita, as personagens, todo o enredo que me cativou desde a primeira página, e o facto de podermos ver três pontos de vista de personagens tão importantes.Definitivamente 5 estrelas."
562,Tracy,"Couldn't put this book down, great psychological easy read, loved it!"
563,Andrea,"This was the July selection for Page Turners Book Club and what a pick! I debated between four and five stars for this one and finally settled on the full five. Why? Because this book knocks it out of the park for what it is trying to achieve. Is this a book that’s going to change the way you see the world? No. Is this a book that’s going to present big ideas or explore complex aspects of life? No. But is it a book that grabs you and just pulls you through every page because it’s intense, engaging, and suspenseful? Absolutely! I can understand the comparisons to Gone Girl, but I actually found this a much more enjoyable read. We have an unreliable narrator who works to unravel her own spotty memory and at times you just want to jump into the book and shake a few more details out of her brain. This was NOT a book to read late at night and I made it about 40% of the way in and then just plowed through until the end, staying up 2 hours past bedtime to finish. Great read and one that makes the entire rest of the world disappear once it gets a hold of you."
564,Natalie Davis,This was a tense thriller and I enjoyed it. Cool how it is told through different voices!
565,Suanne Laqueur,Holy. Crap. 
566,ChapterOne,"Yep. It's good. It's about a girl who is struggling with alcoholism, who travels daily on the train. She may or may not have witnessed a crime. She may or may not have committed the crime herself. She honestly does not know. Because whenever she is drunk, she blacks out and has no recollection whatsoever of what happened while she was drunk. She sets out to find the truth. But the closer she gets to the truth, the closer she gets to endangering her own life. A lot of people have compared this to Gone Girl. Yes, they are both psychological thrillers. Yes, they are both good. But I never once thought of Gone Girl when I read this book. The book that kept coming to my mind, the book I kept comparing this book to, was - Before I Go To Sleep by S J Watson. Another excellent read. All three get 5 stars from me."
567,Jenn Alter,"Fast, fun, interesting read. I couldn't put it down once I really got started."
568,Ashley Tighe stona,So good! Suspenseful... Really easy read because I couldn't put it down. 
569,Emily Dawley,"This is our book club pick and I really enjoyed it. Even though I guessed a huge part of the mystery at 29%, there were still lots of other surprises that kept me interested. I loved the short chapters and alternating points of view. I also really enjoyed the whole idea of how all of Rachel's life and her obsessions seem to revolve around the train lines."
570,Pippa Robson,"That ending, hot damn, was not expecting that, which is kind of the point of the book. Enjoyed and devoured."
571,Suzanne Lilly,What a ride. I couldn't get off this train until I finished the entire story in one sitting. Paula Hawkins is a master at telling a story and diverting attention from the real crime and criminal. It was a satisfying psychological thriller. Recommended.
572,Angelique Darling,Loved this book! I was completely engrossed from the first page to the last. One of the best written books I've read in a long time.
573,Tippy,"The book starts off a little slow but quickly picks up after the first few chapters. Rachel is an alcoholic divorcee who rides the train back and forth everyday between work and where she is living. Along the route she has to pass the home she once shared with her husband. She spends the duration of her rides daydreaming about the people who live in the neighborhood next to her old home, something terrible happens and before you know it she finds herself involved with the case. This book is a mystery/thriller. Hard to put down. "
574,Diego Eusse,"Una historia llena de los comportamientos humanos que no solemos sentarnos a pensar.La forma de escribir y de dividir asíncronamente la trama principal, me pareció cautivadora de principio a fin."
575,Jess,Crazy twisty! If you liked Gone Girl... You'll like this.
576,Joy N. Hensley,Bloody brilliant.
577,Kathy Wade,Fun book to read! I love the differing viewpoints. I really had no idea till the end how it was going to turn out.
578,Liz Sadler,"This book blew my mind! It started a little slow for my taste, but once I got into it the suspense kept me engaged. I totally did not expect Tom to be a killer!!! Throughout the book I often wondered if Rachel had a history of trauma and believe she demonstrated several traits of borderline personality disorder (i.e., issues with boundaries). Kamal was extremely unprofessional and was unethical by befriending Megan, allowing her to come to his house (how did she even know where he lived?), kissing and touching Megan, etc. However, overall this book was highly enjoyable and I would recommend it!"
579,Sonam Yangchen,"I am still recovering this book. I devoured it in three days (but trust me, you can finish it in one sitting), between maddening work deadlines and an afternoon of convalescing at home from one of the worst bouts of menstrual agony. You can not put this book down! It distracted me from urgent obligations of my occupation. And when my eyelids were leaden and sleep was crying to be heard, I put on another kettle and charged through to the very end. The book begins with the introduction of one of the most hopelessly flawed protagonists of the fictional world, Rachel, a lonely train commuter consumed in drunken reveries of her past and the couple who lives in House number 16 on Blenheim Street that she observes with passion on every commute. On one of these droll morning commutes, Rachel sees something that she cannot unsee and what follows after is a wild search for answers, each step revealing more filth and menace. One line to best encapsulate the book: A bunch of lunatics, each more repugnant than the other, entangled in a labyrinthine of a mystery. But oh is it one palpitating, dangerously engrossing, and creepy AF mystery that you can not forget! "
580,Kelley,"This was a great book. I love a book that can be very interesting and still not tell you anything until the very end. I did feel that there were one or two unanswered questions and that always peeves me. Because of that, I would have done 4.5 stars if it was available."
581,Cristina,What a good page-turner!
582,Emily,brilliant book full of suspense and wonder with a great finale I was hooked really engrossing read
583,Sandra Heinzman,"So far, this is one of my favorite books of 2015. While being compared to Gone Girl, the only similarity that I can see is that both are psychological thrillers. I did not figure out the ending and I was surprised! I liked the way the book was written, from the points of view of the three main characters, Rachel, Megan and Anna. None of the characters in the book was particularly likeable, except maybe Rachel's roommate. As Rachel was an unreliable narrator (she had black outs and could not remember what she did or saw), I really had no idea which way the book was going to go; there were lots of twists and turns. The author, Paula Hawkins, is a wonderful writer and I thought the characters were all well written. Like Rachel, I too would be daydreaming and imagining lives about the people I would see if I were passing by on a commuter train, so I found this book very believable. bad things happened to her every time she drank. I would've thought she would try to curb it more, but she was pretty hopeless. I have one question that I must have missed in the reading - what happened to Megan's child that she lost years ago? How did she die - an illness, an accident, or what? Although the book was dark and somewhat depressing, it kept me enthralled until the end and I highly recommend it. I hope our book discussion next week is a good one!"
584,Greg Barron,"This book flowed easily from start to finish, without any hard or slow sections. The ever building suspense made for a top notch psychological thriller that I read in every spare moment over a couple of days. Great entertainment."
585,Nadia,"Wow! Keeps you guessing from beginning to end. Recommended, especially if Gone Girl was a ""like"" for you."
586,Sherry,"The fact that I immediately wanted to give The Girl on the Train five stars is almost strange given that there isn't one single totally likable character.Told by three main female characters, each is so flawed that you almost feel like you can't empathize or sympathize with any of them. Rachel is a raging alcoholic who drinks gin and tonics out of a can on the train home from work and regularly drinks herself into a blackout.Anna is a smug mistress-turned-wife who married Rachel's ex-husband immediately after they split.Megan is a bored wife who entertains running away from her loving husband daily, and enjoys romps with other men to dull the drudgery of married life.They all sound like they should be awful and none of them are reliable witnesses to the world around them. And yet as the story weaves itself following the investigation of a missing woman, you can't help but feel sorry for each of them in different ways.In the end, not one of them is a bad person, they're just each heavily flawed characters.I found myself thinking I couldn't relate to any of them at all only to realize there will little things about each of them that yes, I could relate to or at least understand.I especially love that Rachel makes up stories in her head about Megan and her husband Scott (whom she names Jess and Jason as she doesn't know them), creating a fictional life for them as she passes their house each day on the train. I've occasionally done the same (though to less of a crazy obsessive degree as Rachel!) while bored on the bus so that was kind of a nice touch.I don't often read ""whodunit"" thrillers but I loved this one. It's so fast-paced, it's almost impossible to put down (I read it in less than three days, a rarity for me), and I didn't have my revelation moment where I guessed who the culprit was until very late in the book.Well done, loved it tremendously!"
587,Bev Bjorklund,Great read for vacation. Kept me guessing!
588,Myrah,i hvnt read a mystery novel in a while.this one was a page turner. i really loved it.
589,Dan,"WOW! What an outstanding read. If Alfred Hitchcock was alive and wrote a book, this would have been the result: Fast-paced, can't wait to read the next page, thrilling, and all-in-all, a terrific, not-to-be-missed book. I understand, according to Listopia, this book was the first book read in 2015 among the 40 somethings.  Do yourself a favor and read this book. Most people read it in a day, it took me about 10 days.5 stars"
590,Astri Nardi (Asuka Mai),"Fiewww finally i finished it.... This book was really breathtaking to me!!!Bener-bener tak terduga, aku baru bisa nebak si pelaku baru pada akhir-akhir cerita.Diceritakan dalam 3 sudut pandang, Rachel (yang paling banyak berperan disini), Megan dan Anna.Semua berawal dari Rachel,Wanita pecandu alkohol yang hidupnya berantakan sejak suaminya berselingkuh dan bercerai dari nya. Hmmm, sebelum bercerai dia juga udah mulai depresi sih...Rachel yang tiap hari pulang pergi naik kereta tujuan London, selalu memantau pasangan suami istri Jason dab Jess (bukan nama asli mereka) di balik Jendela kereta, setiap kali Kereta tersebut berhenti di Palang Lampu lalu lintas kereta.Sebenernya Si Rachel ini udah dipecar dari pekerjaan nya hampir sebulan lamanya. Demi tetep keliatan masih seorang employee dia lakuin itu tiap hari, pergi jam pagi pulang nya malem. Supaya flat mate nya ga curiga kalau ia sudah pengangguran. Dia hobi banget merhatiin tingkah laku suami istri Jason dan jess itu karena menurutnya, mereka pasangan sempurna dan saling menyayangi. Mirip seperti hidupnya dulu sewaktu masih bahagia dengan Si Tom, suaminya.Suatu hari dia ngelihat si Jess ini couman sama lelaki lain, alias havingan affair, runtuh sudah lah image dia ttg pasangan sempurna nya.Nah, yang lebih gawat nya,keesokan harinya si Jess ini dinyatakan hilang.Rachel berusaha mengungkapkan apa yang dialamin Jess, dengan berpura-pura jadi temen nya si Jess kepada Jason. Dia berhutang kepada Jason ttg si Jess yang punya affair.Yang lebih parah nya ini, karena dia alkoholik ga ada yang percaya sama omongan nya si Rachel, karena ingatan dia sendiri blur gitu, jadi pengakuan dia sering berubah-ubah.Disinilah dimulai nya semua misteri hilang nya Jess. Satu sama lain ternyata bersangkutan!Bener-bener keren ceritanya.. Bikin gue rela begadang ngabisin ceritanya... Ps. Hati-hati sama orang terdekatmu, entah itu keluarga atau tetangga mu.. Bisa jadi dia seorang psycopat :p :p"
591,Mindy Stevens,Intriguing and very Gone Girlish. This book kept me engaged and was difficult to put down. 
592,Yves Brunet,"I really enjoyed this book. It is a whodounit different from others. I found that the main character had sufficient depth to make it different than most. A girl takes the train every day and it stops at the same spot waiting for a light to change. It stop very close to where she used to live with her ex-husband during happier days. Yet she does not look there, she stares at a house a few numbers down where lives a couple appearing blissfully in love. With time, she gets tangled in their life in a way that it is hard to extirpate herself from it."
593,Emily Timbol,"This was everything I want in a mystery thriller: a compelling but flawed (and unreliable) protagonist, a plot that pulls you in within the first few pages and tightens the reigns on your attention as the chapters go on, and characters that you think you have figured out but end up surprising you. I loved that (slight spoiler alert) The Girl on the Train had an actual, literal red herring in the red-headed stranger on the train. When I finished the book I couldn't help but laugh about that.At first I was worried that the choppy morning/night way of telling the story would get grating and wear on my nerves, but the writing was so good that I barely noticed. I loved how much I cared about and also was annoyed as hell with Rachel. She was such a mess, but as the story went on, I began to suspect why. It was satisfying to have those suspicions confirmed.As someone who reads a lot of mystery/thrillers, I was also pleasantly surprised by how long it took me to figure out who the ""bad guy"" was. I knew before the ""reveal"" but not too much before, which is rare for me. Hawkins did an excellent job of taking the reader on a ride, and telling the story in just enough pieces to keep us turning the pages.I rarely give 5 star reviews but The Girl on the Train deserves it."
594,Laura Pirtle,I know some say this book has some predictability in it. I agree because I figured out things about half way through but the reason I rated it five stars was because it was easy to read and engaged me. I read 300 pages in one day to finish it. I think it deserves a five star rating because I didn't want to put it down. 
595,Wanda,This is psychological suspense at its absolute best. There's no waiting for the tension to build; it's there from the first chapter on. And near the end you can just forget about putting it down. 
596,Sherif,"THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN is a dark, haunting and depressing psychological thriller, but it's incredibly effective thanks to the writing skills of author Paula Hawkins. Rachel is a divorced woman who would do anything for a drink, and like a lot of folks consumed by a love affair with the bottle, one might call her a victim of circumstances. Her husband Tom had an affair that resulted in a pregnancy. He divorced Rachel, married the ""other woman"" and now all three (husband, wife and child) are happily ensconced in the house that was once Rachel's.The train that Rachel rides to London each day takes her past her old neighborhood. From the window of the train she observes not only her old garden that backs up to the tracks, but also the daily activities of another couple who reside down the street from her previous home. In her imagination she has given the couple names and has created a fairy tale love life for them. Real life, however, cannot live up to her fantasy and the couple does not have the picture perfect relationship that Rachel has concocted. When a murder occurs, Rachel becomes entangled in the investigation because of what she has witnessed on her daily commute.This rather bleak story with intersecting timelines is told from the viewpoint of three different women Rachel, Anne and Megan. All the women are unreliable narrators with something to hide. In fact, most of the characters in this novel, including the men, lack veracity, and are a self-serving and unsympathetic group with plenty of skeletons in their closets.Lest I continue and divulge too much of the plot, let me just say that the twists and turns in the story are many and readers will be easily drawn in, making it easy to devour this book in one afternoon."
597,Gavin Felgate,"I had read about this book, which sounded something like ""Rear Window"" on a train, which was what influenced me to read it.It starts with the central character, Rachel, taking her everyday train into work and observing people on the train and people who she sees out of the window, as well as a mysterious pile of clothes on the track. She takes an interest in one particular couple, until a few chapters in when it is revealed that the girlfriend, Megan, has gone missing.Rachel immediately assumes the mantle of detective and starts her own investigation, getting close to Megan's boyfriend Scott by lying about who she is. It does become apparent early on that Rachel is not perfect; she is a recovering alcoholic, who had a bad breakup with her husband Tom. Tom's new wife Anna clearly hates her, and there is also the issue that she had a blackout the night that Megan disappeared, and suddenly Tom and Anna were angry at her, and she has no idea why.I loved the narrative style of the book, written mostly in the present tense, in the form of memoirs and from the point of view, of Rachel, Megan and Anna; the point of view alternates throughout the book, and occasionally moves back and forth in the timeline (Megan's chapters are all told in flashback, not too surprisingly).I liked seeing the world through Rachel's eyes, and then seeing her from the point of view of Anna. It was a good way of giving the characters personality and making me care for Rachel, Megan and (eventually) Anna.I loved the way that the book kept me guessing, and I found it gripping right to the end."
598,Katherine Berger,"I love the switching of narrators, each more unreliable than the other! "
599,nabaa mahboba,"For her first novel paula did a great jop , really great jop .I love all the characters, i feel sorry for racheal , i don't like her weakness , i hate her weakness , paula did good on building up the characters.. Everyone of them was kind mystery , and the surprised form the first to the end we're thrilled, even in the end it just show how hard paula worked on it, the sequence of it are just suitable and in their right pages , it make me curios and take my attention ,and i kept imagining every seance , thats what a good novel should do , and it did it so its worth to be one of the best in 2015 and I'm glad that i read it , and i'll do it again cause i think one read isn't enough for it and beside there is no boring in it at all .. "
600,Elaine,"There is quite a bit of buzz about this book at the moment on Goodreads. Nearly everyone who has read it is raving about it, so I was keen to see if it lives up to the hype – and it does! It is a very tense psychological mystery that really kept me on my toes as I read, turning the pages, not wanting to put it down until I had worked it all out.The train that Rachel commutes on every day always pauses at the same signal and she uses that time every day to people watch – taking a little glimpse of the couple she sees every day on their deck, creating her own little life for them. One day, however, she sees something that doesn’t add up, something that draws her deep into events that are way over her head.The story is told from three different viewpoints and I really enjoyed each one, as each gave a slightly different take on the story. There are a number of characters and all are complex and flawed. They lie, cheat and deceive and so nothing is really as it first appears and, more importantly, nobody is as they first seem. I did work out what was going on, but only just before it became apparent in the book, and I was still kept eagerly reading on to check if I had got it correct.I don’t like to say things like “If you liked XXX then you will like this”, but if you do like psychological, twisty turny tense reads then this should be right up your street. Many thanks to the publisher for the review copy."
601,Cheryl Coldham,I couldn't put this book down. Each page left behind a breadcrumb that just left me wanting more. The author took care to reveal the true nature of each character slowly and methodically. The end result was a rewarding read.
602,Brigit Zelenak,"Voyeurism, unfaithful spouses, blackout drinking, paranoia, shame, hope, fear, betrayal, murder, revenge; this whodunit has it all. Paula Hawkins throws everything at us but the kitchen sink and, just like Oliver Twist, we’re left at the end, hands outstretched, plaintively beseeching, “Please, Ma’am, may we have some more”. The Girl On The Train locks you in early and doesn’t let go until the last line is left reverberating in your head. If you look up ‘page-tuner’ in the dictionary, it will most likely reference this novel. An excellent read, I look forward to whatever Hawkins publishes next. "
603,Jodi Ragner,Made you think all the way through
604,Rachael Schuler,"I loved this book. Easy read. Good twist. Main character totally pathetic -- but that's what kept it interesting. If you have a little voyeur in you, you'll love it! LOL"
605,Georgette,Holy crap! it did come out of nowhere. LOVED IT. better than woebegone girl.
606,Regina Foo,"This review is originally posted on: http://wp.me/p5m5jd-at.Disclaimer: I obtained this copy of ARC from the publisher in exchange for my honest review.The Girl on the Train is a fast-paced, dark, disturbing, mysterious and propelling psychological thriller that not to be missed.Narrated in first person POV alternating among 3 women in different chapters, I'm able to see that every one of them has their own secrets not to be told to anyone, including their closest ones. They have their own issues in life and their hatred towards other persons in their lives.Plot====The story started with Rachel, who commutes twice daily during weekdays on a train between Ashbury and Euston. The train will stop at a signal point where she can look outside the window at the houses at Blenheim Road (Witney), particularly at Number 15 and Number 23.Every weekdays when she's on the train, she's very eager to be able to look at the Number 15 house with a couple she named them as Jess and Jason. She would never expect she could be able to know them personally until one day, something terrible happened that linked them together.I like how the writer put the little pieces together to make the 3 women who seems unrelated to become related in some ways, some how. And all these little pieces makes the story full of mysteries which I'm quite shocked and thrilled at the part near the ending of the story.Characters==========Even though the book has 3 narrators, Rachel Watson plays a major part in the story.Rachel is an alcoholic who couldn't accept the fact of her divorce and she even lost her job because of her drinking problems. Most of the time, I would think that she's a mess and quite hopeless in getting herself back to her normal life and she definitely needs help from AA (Alcoholic Anonymous). Sometimes I might think that she's getting better as she doesn't drink for a couple of days but I'm quite disappointed when she picks up that bottle of wine or tin of gin and tonic again.Another narrator of the story is Megan who lives at Number 15 and being labelled as ""Jess"" by Rachel. She babysits Tom and Anna's daughter who live at Number 23. She has a troubled past that she never tell her husband, Scott (Rachel's ""Jason""). The lives of these 3 women change after Megan went missing.Anna, who seems like the happiest lady among the 3 narrators gave birth to Evie after she married Tom. Even so, she hates Rachel and occasionally she'll get stressed by the nonsense caused by Rachel.The other two characters narrated in the story are Tom and Scott. Both Tom and Scott are loving husbands and to others, they are the dream man of most of the women. But when I read through the story, it's unbearable to know the dark side of every characters.Conclusion==========I've read Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn before I pick up this book. But I'm not going to compare them even though they have some similarities like missing girl.After finished reading this book, I asked myself: ""Do I feel sorry for the women in the book?"" I would say no. Even though you would say that the unfortunate events happened to them deserves my sympathy but I think that somehow they need to be responsible for what they did.Take Rachel for example, she knows that it's her own fault to become a drinker. But did she help herself to get rid of the ""disease""? There are a lot of times we would expect others to take the blame when something bad happened to us. But before that, have you ever think of any other things that you can do to make it better?Overall, this book is a page-turner and basically I would resist the urge to put down the book and get to sleep especially when Megan went missing. So I'm not surprised to know that a staff of the publisher was reading the book secretly under the table during a meeting because she was at twelve pages from the end.This book is highly recommended to the readers who love thrillers and even if you don't read thrillers, try it out."
607,Inês Guedes,"Depois de Gillian Flynn, e das comparações feitas entre a autora e Paula Hawkins, li o livro com o dobro do cuidado, não fosse alguém dar numa de Amy Dunne. Os comentários à volta da Rapariga no Comboio foram presságios-- o livro arrebatou, com ou sem aviso; não se importou que eu não confia-se em nenhuma das personagens, a uma certa altura até se desconfia da vitima, não vá estar viva afinal. Fica como um dos melhores de 2015, recomendação enorme-- vamos ver em quem confias, só para seres provada errada uma e outra vez. "
608,Briana Alzola,Definitely liked this one. It made my skin crawl in parts. It's one of those books that makes you worried that maybe you don't actually know anyone around you.
609,Anette,"I have been dreading writing this review because from the beginning I hated the main character. I found Rachel extremely irritating, a drunk girl who threw everything away and insisted in feeling sorry for herself. The reason I didn't stop reading was because I do not like to not finish a book .... but then I still give 5 stars, why? Because this book will blow your mind! You will doubt everything you think you know, and will want to re-read it just to see how many clues you have missed.The characters are complex and seriously troubled. The book will take you on quite a ride. So many twists and turns. Cannot give it away. It is destined to be a brilliant movie. I can understand why it is being compared to ""Gone Girl"", and I really hope that who ever makes the movie keeps close to the original book. "
610,Полина (Polina),Review: The Girl on the Train | Cogito Ergo Sumhttps://elexithymia.wordpress.com/201...
611,Suzanne (Chick with Books) Yester,"The Girl on The Train by Paula Hawkins… OMG! This has to be one of my absolute favorite reads so far this year! Murder, obsession, evil, jealousy, cruelty and heartbreaking at times, The Girl on The Train has what it takes to keep you turning those pages and let me tell you… the twist at the end will have your jaw drop! It is so deceptively simple in some ways, that as you are reading, suddenly the sun is setting, day turns into night and your eyes have not left the page. I wasn't furiously turning the pages, I was absentmindedly turning the pages because I was so engrossed in the story.Here's the gist… Rachel Watson rides the train everyday past a housing complex and becomes obsessed with this couple she sees most days lounging on their patio… until Rachel sees something that she shouldn't see. But because Rachel has some problems of her own, when she tries to tell someone what she saw, no one believes her… until… Read this book! Both a great murder mystery and literary fiction. Well written characters, a leading lady that you can empathize with, and a great story. If Hitchcock were to write murder mysteries, this would be it!I give this 5+ Train Tickets! Hop aboard and enjoy"
612,Khaled Charkie,"“One for sorrow, two for joy, three for a girl . . . Three for a girl. I’m stuck on three, I just can’t get any further. My head is thick with sounds, my mouth thick with blood. Three for a girl. I can hear the magpies—they’re laughing, mocking me, a raucous cackling. A tiding. Bad tidings. I can see them now, black against the sun. Not the birds, something else. Someone’s coming. Someone is speaking to me. Now look. Now look what you made me do.”I wanted a new kind of book to read, something that will always keep me reading despite my long pauses. So, I chose this book. Mainly about three women which their destinies meet together though they were apart. A story about how love could take us far, not that pure love, but that cheated sense of desperation to one another.A book that shows how love and anger if went out of control, could destroy not just ourselves, but the sense of humanity in our innermost. Terrible things could happen when we cross our limits, lives and the hearts of our beloved ones toward some unstable, temporary and valueless relationships made upon fragile and empty sensations.Men and women assuming that love is a soccer game, throwing its ball to one another, will soon perceive how hard and fatal this game is. A game with no winner or loser, a game of chaos, and opaqueness. A game of loss.If this book is to be read for a moral, I will summarize it below: Never seek the guidance of anger, to lead your love, to a truth less destiny.P.S: Some may pointed that this book has a slow pace. But in reality, I find it necessary since the plot is so heavy and fragile at the same time. But the author did an awesome job!I even felt so touched at some points, since we were so connected to the characters!"
613,Suzanne,This is the best book I've read in a while. Throughout the story you end up doubting all of the characters at some point. I love how unpredictable it is. 
614,Amy Bandy,It has been a while since I read a book that I felt the need to discuss. I even got my husband interested and kept giving him updates as I proceeded through the book. It was refreshing to have a couple of female characters who were to be both admired and pitied at the same time. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and think that anyone who enjoys a thriller with a few twists and turns will too. 
615,Maria Carragher,"What made this story so interesting was definitely the unreliable narrators and the twisted plot. I felt so many emotions while reading this. I went from hating Scott, to liking him, from hating Anne to liking her, from liking Megan to hating her… As frustrating as the main character Rachel was, I always enjoyed reading from her point of view. She could seem a little crazy at times, but I still liked her character overall and I genuinely felt bad for what she had gone through. I sometimes questioned if what she was saying was true, due to her alcohol intake. I wanted so badly for her to remember the events of the night that Megan went missing, and hoped that she wasn’t to blame. Paula Hawkins did an incredible job at writing such complex characters. Every single one of them is extremely flawed and difficult to trust.Not once did I have the ending figured out. The story flowed quite nicely and every plot twist had me hanging on the edge of my seat. I haven’t read a book that had me glued to every page like this since I read Gillian Flynn’s Gone Girl. I think I may have been even more captivated by this one. After I read about Megan’s disappearance, I couldn’t put this book down until I had it all figured out. The Girl on the Train is worth all of it’s hype in my opinion. If you’re in the mood for a great thriller, be sure to pick this one up! 5 out of 5 stars!https://readsbymandm.wordpress.com/20..."
616,Alex Dimario,"Loved it, Rachel is my spirit-animal trainwreck. "
617,Greta is Erikasbuddy,"This is a great book!If you thought GONE GIRL was awesome then you will really dig this.I will warn you that it does take place in England so the geography might be unfamiliar. I now wish I knew the London area better.You guess 'who done it' through most of the book. And just when you have that 'aha' moment, it changes like 3 times more.The story is told from 3 points of view which made the book flow great and you hardly get bored. It surprised me how much I read yesterday. Time just seems to zoom by as you try to piece the puzzle together.Definitely something I would recommend to my mom."
618,Lynetta,"a taut book with an unreliable narrator who is a woman, not a girl. Rachel takes the same train into London and back, although home is not an accurate description of her destination she returns to. Rachel was drunk when she had lunch with a client and lost the deal and her job. Now Rachel is living with a woman, Cathy, in a rented room. Cathy who means well, initially does not know Rachel has is unemployed and struggling to remain sane amid her losses. Her husband, Tom, has left her for another woman, Anna, because of her drinking problem. They have a new baby, which is another dismay because Rachel wanted a baby but did not conceive. When drunk Rachel often calls Tom and drives both Tom and Anna crazy.On her trips Rachel makes up the story of a man and woman, Jason and Jess, she often sees from the train in the house down the street from Tom and Anna. Megan, the real name of Jess, had an gallery that has closed. Megan has babysat for Tom and Anna. Then Megan, beautiful, but with a secret history, goes missing. Rachel has seen Megan kissing a tall, handsome man and tries to help Scott, Megan's husband. With only a few other auxiliary characters author Paula Hawkins has spun a first rate whodunit. "
619,Silvia,"Wow, what a psychological thrill ride this book was...absolutely love the roller coaster ride I just went on reading this book. Such an adventure.I had purchased this book and put it on my to read list for this year, to read at some point as I have like hundreds of books I wanted to read first. But a talk show called the Social have a book club and this book was the read for this month, so I wanted to read it so when I watched them review it I would enjoy it more and I`m so glad I did. I couldn`t put this book down...had to keep reading until I finished it.It really makes you think if you really know anyone and that what you perceive to see isn`t always what you actually see...blurred perceptions. After reading this book it makes you realize the saying that the grass is greener is definitely not true. The book is told from three points of view...Rachel Watson who is the girl on the train, Anna Watson who is the new wife of Rachel`s ex husband and Megan Hipwell a neighbour of Anna`s and the woman who Rachel admires every day while on the train. These women, one is an alcoholic, one a liar and cheat and the other is just a selfish bitch for better terms. With characters like these why would you want to read this book well because its just WOW...even with all their flaws its nice reading a book where the characters don`t have a perfect life and are perfect. There`s so much emotions you feel while reading this book that tug at your heartstrings and it will blow your mind and leave you at the edge of your seat. I don`t want to reveal anything as it will ruin the story and the wow factor, but it`s a book you have to read if you like a good psycho thriller. God I hope they turn this book into a movie."
620,Darren,It was a good book. I liked it a lot. It was a good thriller book for this first time author. I hope she continues writing good books.
621,Anna Crenshaw,"I don't think it should be placed on the same shelf as Gone Girl, but it is still extremely well written. It catches your attention. You love and hate the characters equally. You want to kill them and help them at the same time. I did not see the end coming until it was there. Very well done. Very worth the read."
622,Rick,Pretty impressive for a first effort. Clever plotting. Weird people. But the good?? Win in the end 
623,Rita Chaney,"The Girl on the Train was riveting. I could not predict where this story was going. The main character, Rachel, had more than a few flaws; a drinking problem that was out of control and a seeming inability to tell the truth. Floating helplessly through life, she yearned for an earlier time when she was married. Would her husband return to her? How could she make it happen? Along with these struggles, she often vicariously observed the lives of others while riding the train through her old neighborhood. She saw something that perplexed her. But did she really see what she thought she saw? The unfolding story of Rachel will keep you hooked in to this story until it's unexpected conclusion. Loved it."
624,Clementine Dimacali,"I enjoyed the unexpected twists and turns in this book. Very fast paced, it's quite easy to get into the story. Characters are all pretty screwed up in their own ways so at first you may not know who the villain may be. Not much character development, but this is not that kind of book. I do recommend for murder mystery lovers and those who prefer fast paced books."
625,Jackie Bean,An absolute page-turner. This book sucked me in right away. 
626,Pete Cummins,"It must be horrible for all the bright people out there to read a book like this and know the ending before they get there. Me? I'm not so bright, which is ok as I can immerse myself in a great book like this & not have a clue what is going on until the big reveal. Life is good! Read it before the film comes out!"
627,Tricia,Yes. I loved it.
628,Anna Martino,"Listened to the audiobook and it was so engaging I would stay in my car to finish a chapter no matter how long it took. The readers are great and I thought really made you feel for the characters. That said, like Gone Girl, I hated everyone in this book. People making horrible choices even if the intention was good. It was twisted and wonderful and. I loved the premise of it. I ride the metro sometimes to Pasadena and I would wonder what was happening in some of the homes along the line. It was just wonderfully written, fast paced and an excellent read. I was thinking that some of my older ya readers would really enjoy this book. I think if they liked Stephanie Kuehn or Chris Crutcher this would be a good one to suggest. "
629,Terri Lynn,"I read this so fast, I startled myself. I had to keep going and I didn't figure who had done it until just before the author gave it away. Rachel is ""the girl on the train"" who pretends to her friend/flatmate/landlady Cathy that she still has a job when in fact she had been fired months earlier for costing her company an important client while drunk. She broke up her own marriage to Tom over her alcoholism. Now she rides the train to and from London as she always did, pretending she still had a job so Cathy wouldn't suspect.It is while she rides this train that she always looks to her old house where her husband, who cheated on her with a slut named Anna, still lives, having married Anna and having had a baby girl Evie with her. Rachel is just a pathetic loser and really, Anna is the same insecure type creature. On the street where she lived, Rachel has created a fantasy life of a perfect marriage for Scott and Megan, a couple she spies on as the train passes. Soon though she is drawn into a nightmare- she has kept drunkenly pursuing Tom and Anna and now that neighbor of theirs -Megan has gone missing. She involves herself in the case and the killer is willing to kill anyone who gets too close to solving Megan's murder. Who could the killer be- jealous husband Scott who found out Megan was having affairs? Anna- afraid of losing Tom to Megan? Tom- was he sleeping with Megan? The exotic psychiatrist Megan was seeing (and sleeping with)? Or could it even be Rachel herself since she was there that night, drunk and furious at Megan for kissing the doctor in her front yard (she had this sick and elaborate fantasy going about Megan and Scott and was angry at the cheating) who wound up at home with blood all over her and a blacked out memory of what she had seen and done that night? I enjoyed this mystery a lot."
630,Valerie Doherty,"Hallmarks of a killer thriller from one reader's perspective: (Book Riot Challenge- 2015- Guilty Pleasure Category - Thrillers)1. There's speed in the read. Mini cliff hangers throughout the book compel a reader to turn the page. 2. Characters develop across time and their complex traits are revealed through their actions. It's all about, ""Show the reader, don't tell."" First rate dialogue matches the character and their traits. The dialogue is believable to a reader. Would this person say that? 3. There is a sense of disquiet and apprehension that contribute to the reader's desire to keep moving through text. ""This is creepy, but I just have to know."" 4. Settings' descriptions deliver a sense of foreboding (rain, heat, claustrophobic space). All of these descriptions ratchet up the feeling of tension.5. Elements of surprise keep a reader off balance and interested. Predictable events and character cliche would not be welcome in a psychological thriller. Bull's-eye, Ms. Hawkins. This reader thinks you hit the mark on a debut thriller. I can see this one headed to film. Thanks for the wild ride!"
631,Sheila Allee,I can't recall ever reading such a captivating book. I couldn't wait to get to the next chapter and the next. Paula Hawkins is a masterful writer. Her prose just flows without any bumps or hiccups. 
632,Ali Rae,I loved this book! It was suspenseful and hard to put down. I highly recommend it! 
633,Robb Lepack,Good read. Can't wait to see it on the big screen. 
634,Nadine Pennisi,Loved this a lot better than Gone Girl.
635,Linda Dobinson,"I LOVED this book. The story rattled along like an express - what a ride. I loved how all the strands of the story were interwoven like hair in a tight plait, and each time it was a surprise to learn how close they all were. I thought the character development of Rachel - the main narrator - was excellent. She is unreliable but there is a reason for that and it is not all down to her. Some reviewers say she is unlikable but I liked her and felt sorry for her. Because of the multiple narrators it is tricky to guess who-dun-it, and I had everyone in the frame at some point which made it exciting. I recommend this book."
636,Jennifer Mack,Amazing. Can not put this one down! 
637,Diane Patterson,"Really good. Extremely entertaining (read in a cross-country flight). Rachel sits on the train, making up stories about the ""perfect couple"" she sees at one house every day. Only as time goes on do you realize that Rachel is just as obsessed about her ex and his new wife, a few doors down. And Rachel may be a somewhat unreliable narrator. Then the wife of the ""perfect couple"" disappears. A well-plotted, well-told story. The weakest part was not liking the characters, but there is such a great explanation for at least one of the things that I gave the author extra kudos at the end for that. "
638,Rachel Danielle Schiavone,This thriller reads like a screenplay...and I'd like to watch it!
639,Allie D'Orazio,"After reading this novel, I have no choice but to leave a stellar review. My mom recommended this book, ""The Girl on the Train"" by Paula Hawkins, with high praise. I agree with every word she said. I was skeptical first, as a result of the confusion from reading three points of views at once. The trick to reading this novel, as I can fully suggest, is that you have to stick with it throughout the first few chapters. Once you know what is going on, it will be well worth the initial baffling feelings you may have reading throughout the mystery. It is important to keep in mind that the entire point of the novel is for the reader to not know everything that is happening, otherwise it would not be a mystery. Hawkins does a wonderful job with balancing out three points of views, giving just enough detail to hook the reader yet leaving out just enough to leave them wanting more. The characters, while at first some may be hateful, are quite lovable in the end with a series of plot twists and unexpected reveals about each. The novel also delves into the psychological realm of each aspect of the mystery. This serves to be very purposeful in the analyzation of the plot and motivation behind the crime which was committed, by of course, an unexpected character. I don't want to post about any spoilers, because it would ruin the book, but instead I will talk about the symbolization in the novel. The foreshadowing used in the beginning of the book was so important, yet it could be missed at a first read over. I had read this book twice before fully grasping each symbol and deeper meaning to them, as well as catch the hidden foreshadowing. Hawkins did such a sly and clever job at flawlessly leading the reader on down each falsely paved path, yet guiding them to the correct destination at the end every time. "
640,Amy Herrington,"I highly recommend this. The comparisons with Gone Girl are obvious i.e. similar pacy writing style, multiple narrators, mystery to work out etc. I didn't rate Gone Girl very highly though so was unsure whether I'd enjoy The Girl on the Train. It had been at the top of the Kindle most popular charts for months and when it finally came down in price to a couple of pounds I thought I might as well, since there are a lot of good reviews on here. I agree with others that it is basically a better, British, Gone Girl. One of my main reasons for not liking GG is that the characters and scenario felt so unbelievable. The 3 narrators here, particularly Rachel the Girl from the title, felt a lot more realistic. The way she spoke about her alcoholism, struggle to conceive, and her overall bitterness at her relationship ending in infidelity was all so convincing and, yes, real. When Rachel talked about being replaced by another woman (Anna), this stood out: 
""She must be very secure in herself, I suppose, in them, for it not to bother her, to walk where another woman has walked before. She obviously doesn’t think of me as a threat. I think about Ted Hughes, moving Assia Wevill into the home he'd shared with Plath, of her wearing Sylvia's clothes, brushing her hair with the same brush. I want to ring Anna up and remind her that Assia ended up with her head in the oven, just like Sylvia did.""
 The quality of writing was excellent throughout and the 3 women all had distinct ""voices"". Although the pace slowed slightly at a couple of points, for the most part I was gripped and didn't want to stop reading. The denouement might be disappointing for some as it could possibly be guessed, but I still think it came together in a way that was much more believable than Gone Girl. It really was a fantastic read that I got through in a few hours. I think it will be very difficult for author Paula Hawkins to follow this – her first novel – as it was so good, but I'll certainly be keeping an eye out for anything else she comes up with. "
641,Emma,"“There’s something comforting about the sight of strangers safe at home.”So thinks Rachel, a troubled divorced alcoholic who takes the train to London every day. Recently unemployed, she is commuting in to the city to avoid telling her landlord that she lost her job. Rachel loves the train rides, and always keeps an eye out for one particular house along the tracks. She has constructed a story of the couple who reside there, Jason and Jess, and likes to think of them as the perfect couple with the perfect life that she herself once aspired to. But when Jess goes missing, Rachel suddenly finds herself involved in a criminal investigation.This debut novel, a fast-paced thriller in the same vein as Gone Girl, is a great summer beach read because it keeps you guessing. A real page-turner, featuring three deeply flawed and unreliable narrators, this book touches on alcoholism, marriage, infidelity, infertility, motherhood, and of course, murder.It seems like everyone has a secret, and the reader is kept in the dark and must determine which narrator can be trusted. The author has created a clever story with the intrigue of an excellent psychological mystery. Interesting to note that “The Girl on the Train” is the fastest-selling adult novel in history having sold more than two million copies in the U.S. alone since it was published in early 2015. The book has already been optioned for a movie."
642,Lauren Bernard,"On the edge of my seat. So interesting, amazingly suspenseful. Fantastic book. Read it so fast."
643,Dave Fonseca,Better than Gone Girl!
644,Lorie,"Read This Book I read the Sample of this book and thought maybe, maybe not. Then my daughter recommended it, so I started it again. At first I was a bit put off by Rachel and her drinking but then it started to become a very important part of the story and I stopped thinking of all the people in my life she reminded me of and started getting caught up in the twists and turns Author Hawkins was leading me through and found myself anxious to get through each chapter and onto the next piece of the puzzle. A few reviewers have compared The Girl on the Train to a Hitchcock Thriller and I wholeheartedly agree. Not sure how good a movie this would make but I am sure that it is a Great Read. Start it as soon as you can and be prepared to not want to do anything else until you finish."
645,Michelle Watson,"This novel was simply amazing and so wonderful to read. The author did a great job with the Rachel and the plot. I've never been more frustrated and annoyed at a character in my life. Rachel just couldn't get it right. She just kept fucking up. I wanted to take the drink right from her hand and down it for myself, then slap some sense in to her. She redeemed herself in the end. And Anna blew my mind (in a weirdly pleasant way) by the end.The ending left me quite shaken. So much so that I fell and took a tumble down the street when I went to walk my dog after. There's blood on my hands and cuts on my knees. I'm still quivering."
646,Amanda,"The Girl on the Train is a read-in-one-sitting thriller from the perspectives of three women in each others’ orbits. They’re all flawed-to-unlikeable, but somehow still sympathetic, which is a nice balancing act and the result of some skillful writing. Overall, the whole book is successful on so many levels, from being an enticing character study, to a fast-paced, compelling mystery.Have you seen that Donald Glover sketch about crazy women stories vs crazy man stories? If you haven’t, I recommend you watch it, but if you can’t, here’s the money quote:“I realized like…every man, every man in this room has a crazy woman story, you know? Like every man in here is just like, ‘Oh, remember Christine? Christine was crazy! Christine was so crazy! Remember when I had my new girl and Christine comes up like, ‘Where that bitch at?!’ And I was like, ‘Christine, what’s goin’ on? I got my new girl, get out of here!’ Christine was crazy, right? Christine was crazy. Aww…memories.You know, and every dude in here has that story. And I was like, why don’t women have crazy men stories? Why don’t women have crazy men stories? I don’t really hear them. And then I realized and I was like, OH. It’s because if you have a crazy boyfriend…you gon’ die.”And that more or less describes this book. Every one of the three female protagonists is the type that some guy, somewhere — probably many guys — would call a “crazy bitch,” for various reasons. And they’re all varying levels of “crazy,” but if you’re a woman you know: all it takes is one tic, one anxiety, one less than serene behavior, and that’s all you need for some guys (and women!) out there to take you less than seriously. And worse, the “crazier” you are, the easier it is for an even crazier man to get away with manipulation, abuse, and murder. This book is fiction, hyperbole, but it’s also truth.First, we meet Rachel. She’s a depressed alcoholic who is still hung up on her ex-husband, and she rides the same train every day from her home to a job in London that she was fired from months before, just so that she can ride by her old house that she shared with him. Reading her earliest chapters is an ongoing exercise in fremdschämen: with every drink, and every “good idea,” you’re shouting at her, “Rachel, NO!” It’s one of these “good ideas” that gets her wrapped up in the disappearance of Megan Hipwell, a woman who lives down the street from Rachel’s old house with her husband, Scott Hipwell. Before her disappearance, though, Rachel had also been watching Megan and Scott from the train — calling them Jess and Jason — and fantasizing about what appeared to be their perfect marriage. It’s this obsession with them, as well as a coincidental proximity to the neighborhood around the time that Megan goes missing, that causes Rachel to involve herself, thinking she can help.Then, we get into Megan’s mind, first in chapters that begin approximately a year or so before Rachel’s chapters and the disappearance. Though not formally diagnosed, Megan is probably something of a manic depressive. A former addict with a few darker demons, Megan is mostly happy with Scott, but nonetheless begins to feel stifled over time by his love. The more overbearing he seems to her, the more she tries to draw away, and the harder he tries to bring her back in. She self-medicates with infidelity, some of which Scott is aware of, and that doesn’t help his hovering, as he’s constantly wondering if Megan is distant because she’s having an affair, or if she’s just withdrawn. Reading these chapters sets up the context to her eventual disappearance and paints a stark contrast to the perfect woman painting Rachel initially creates of her,Finally, we meet Anna. She’s the current wife of Rachel’s ex-husband, Tom. You’re mostly sympathetic to her, because you already know that Rachel hangs around, calls and emails Tom all the time, and is generally still a semi-threatening presence that the family can’t seem to shake. Still, the other thing you know about Anna is that she was the “other woman” when Tom began cheating on Rachel. Until you read her perspective, your feelings about her are entirely formed by your personal feelings about “the other woman,” but at the very least, you understand why Rachel resents her (if not why Rachel still stalks her family.)To say too much more is potentially giving clues away. There is an argument to be made for all of these people and more, at some point, to be responsible for Megan’s disappearance, and the story skillfully unravels what happened while exploring the dark psychology of failed (and doomed) relationships and the emotional toll they take.

647,Alyssa,"lost myself in the pages, spent a well-deserved sunburnt afternoon on the beach, and finished the book within the day. success!"
648,Laura Watson,"If people say that all the characters in this book are a train wreck, they definitely aren't lying. And, truthfully, that's probably why I liked it so much and yet hated it so much. I can't give it less than 5 stars though simply because I really did want to know what happened next through the entire story. I probably could have read this in one sitting if it hadn't been for real life getting in the way. Each of the POV characters were just as lost and confused as the next one. It was something that was very interesting to me.The entire time I was reading I couldn't help but feel like most of the characters were people that I could have encountered on the street. I wanted to be the girl on the train fantasizing about the lives of the people who lived in the houses that I passed. For Rachel, though, she actually got to know them in ways that she probably never expected for all the wrong reasons. It's fast paced and gives a sort of insight into abusive relationships and alcoholism that was way more real than I expected it to be. I bought this book because I kept hearing about it everywhere and I have to agree. It is amazing. "
649,Susan Qin,"1. The arrangement is fascinating. At the end, it is actually quite a simple story. What makes a story fascinating is not the the story, but the order/arrangement/way the author tells it. All the three girls take turns to narrate. It helps readers to see the difference from eyes of different people-can be quite different, isn't it?2.You don't have to like the characters- the author only writes the dark side of people.All of them are train wrecks and totally messed up, none of them are lovable characters. At the beginning, I feel very uncomfortable and I would rather not know about those messed-up lives.When I read half through the book, I get the feeling that maybe the author just writes about the dark side of human nature.At the end, I realize that all these messed up lives got an explanations. - The more Rachel messed up, (view spoiler)[the more horrible Tom lied and manipulated her.(view spoiler)[3.Vivid descriptions of alcoholicsThe way Rachel thinks and hides the liquors(in milk box?!) and finding comforts from drinking, what makes people start to drink- both Rachel and Anna-makes me wonder whether the author is also an alcoholic.4.Jess & JasonP86-I realize that perhaps, after all, she isn't so different from me.P224-But it goes to show, doesn't it, that you think you know someone and then…P319-I have the clearest memory of Scott talking about Megan, saying I don't even know who she was.Nobody's life is as perfect as we imagine. People believe what they wanna believe.5.Three different attitudes towards babies.Rathel-wants baby so bad, and invest tons of money in xxx several times and became an alcoholic out of it.Magen-P19-He thinks spending time around babies will make me broody.In fact,it's doing exactly the opposite; when I leave their house I run home, can't wait to strip my clothes off and get into the shower and wash the baby smell off me.Anna-P232-I keep telling myself this while I'm trying to get egg yolk out of my hair, while I'm crawling around on the floor picking up spoons and upturned bowls. I keep telling my self this is normal.Still, when we were finally done and she was playing happily by herself,I let myself cry for a minute.6.Weakness & ManipulationP314-This is what he does-this is what he always does.He's a master at it , making me fell as though everything is my fault, making me feel worthless.The more miserable Rachel is, the more manipulated Tom has been.He mamaneged to make Rachel believe that it was her hurt herself and he was the one helping her.

650,Lindsey Kyle,"awesome, gripping, better than Gone Girl! Please do yourself the favor and read this book!!1"
651,Cynthia,"This was a quick, ""could not put out down"" read. Excellent, decadent read. It was like looking through a window into the lives of these people who had lots of little secrets. Great for a quick, captivating read."
652,MJ,"I read this in one day and don't usually get into thrillers, but the suspense was really well-done and well-paced and I definitely could feel my pulse going off at the end!"
653,Hanna Martine,Really quite brilliant. I listened to the audio and the narrators were awesome.
654,Annija Čekstere,"When you want to read some book, you almost always search for a gripping, interesting storyline and characters. When I started to read this book, I was a bit disappointed at first because I had read the reviews about it before so I had very high expectations in the beginning, but the first ~80 pages deceived me. It wasn't very gripping and attention-catching. It was just a story about a weird woman who went on the train to London and imagined lives of the people who lived by the train tracks. But it was just the beginning. After the, not to say boring, but not very gripping part, came very very interesting storyline with many plot twists especially when it came to the very end. It became so thrilling I couldn't put the book away! The characters became very easy to identify with and I was really captivated. All the plot twists were so unpredictable and I just couldn't believe it was really going to end like that! I highly recommend this book to everyone who wants to enjoy a very good book. This is, in my opinion, one of the best psycological thrillers and I think every fan of detective novels will be astounded by this book!"
655,Halena Frick,Fast paced. Well written. Really got into it and had to know who did it. They are all awful people! 
656,Jenifer Ruff,I loved how this dark story became clearer and clearer a little bit at a time. I enjoyed trying to figure out what happened and where it was going.
657,Marie B.,"Increíble. Magistral. En cuanto cogí este libro, supe que me iba a encantar. Me enganchó muchísimo desde la primera página; y es que esto era todo lo que necesitaba después de esta sequía literaria de tantos meses, un libro así era todo lo que necesitaba: un libro tan fresco, que presenta otro tipo de historia, otro tipo de personajes, otro tipo de narración -ya que está contado desde los diferentes puntos de vista de las tres protagonistas-... Un libro diferente, que no fuese lo típico de lo que ya estoy harta.Cada página es más increíble que la anterior. Nunca sabes lo que te vas a encontrar en la siguiente hoja, pero sabes que va a ser sorprendente y totalmente inesperado. En cuanto al final -que es lo que últimamente no solía convencerme del todo en los libros-: magnífico. Es cierto que ya (de algún modo) te lo esperas, ya que poco a poco lo van dejando caer a medida que avanzan las páginas; esa es la única ''pega'' que le pongo, que al fin y al cabo no es una pega, ya que es algo inevitable.Se lo recomiendo a todo el mundo. Fantástico."
658,Nitza,excellent
659,Baudelaire Violet,"Imagine that your life is a total mess. You are depressed and you are alone. The only thing that entertains you is that couple who you see in your train window every single day, passing by their house. You know them so well. They are happy. They are in love. Until one of them is missing and you are the only one who saw IT.You saw IT, but of course no one will believe you. Why? Because you are a filthy, stinking alcoholic, an ex-wife who got fat, an ex who can't move on, a desperate worthless someone. They all think that's what you are. Not to forget the blackouts,during which you've done horrible things in the past, and which things you couldn't remember the morning after that. And one of this blackouts happened just on the night of the disappearence. You know one thing. You were on that street, and you saw SOMETHING. But can you trust yourself? And if not, tha who could you trust. There is them. The man who broke your heart and his new wife, the woman who stole your dreams. And they are the neighbours of the missing woman. Did they saw anything? Were they involved? Her husband who lost all of his hope. Who is the main suspect. You like him a lot. He's just like you. Broken and abandoned. He understands you. And he can't be the murdereer. You know him. They don't. You saw the real him. Did you really?And there is B. The one who was kept in secret. The one who denies the obvious, the only one about whom you know that he is one 100 percent lying. The thing is: how do you prove it? Why are you so sure that you aren't the one who did it? You want to solve this mystery. You want to remember. You want to know the truth. Although be careful, because EVERYONE IS LYING and you won't expect this kind of truth. "
660,Ariel,"I would like to begin by saying that I recommended this book to a lot of people and even neglected by monthly book club read for this.This is dark. Like, it's going to make you think real hard about 'things' in general. For instance, I spent one night (probably more than that) just sitting there and thinking about my own life. Which I think most people do, but this was serious, this was dark.Our main character is someone that you will want to save. You will want to reach into that book and pull her up, brush her off, and take her to an AA meeting. While I felt at times that I just wanted to shake her for my frustration with her memory and with her addiction, I changed my tune.Our character rides the trains, drunk or sober, she rides the trains. Through the windows she create a new life, actively imagining how her previous neighbors lived and becoming jealous of the rich fantasy that she created in her head. By and by through a drunken night and this active fantasy - she finds herself in not only in danger, but pulling on a continuous rope trying to find those lost memories from one night as well as what went wrong with her marriage.As a reader, I used to become so annoyed with novels that told the story through multiple perspectives of the characters involved. But as I've gotten older, I have grown more appreciative of this and enjoyed reading and understanding the other characters through this form of writing. I have become more appreciative of how straining this is on a writing and how it helps them develop their story.The author does a wonderful job of 'feeling' for the main character. She is an alcoholic, depressed, divorced, unemployed, and on the cusp of being homeless. Her world was shattered when her husband left her for someone and then .. of course .. had a child with the other woman. Her rich fantasy life keeps replaying this in her head, reminding her of a time when she was happy - or at least not alone. But this story tells more than just a cheating husband who finds happiness with someone else. Much, much more."
661,Alyson,"Amazing audiobook. A little hard to get into with the three (unreliable) narrators, but each one is fantastic. Made the three women so believable that I completely bought the story."
662,Monique Nenson,"This is a book that grips you from the start. I couldn't put it down so I ended up reading it a single day. In my own categories, I would classify this as a psychological thriller. Obsession, deceit, and repressed memories... All things that work to send Rachel down the road towards self-distruction. However, when she needs answers, she's like a dog with a bone. She can't avoid putting herself into awkward situations as well as putting herself in harm's way as she tries to come to terms with her broken marriage, while, at the same time, trying to help the husband of a missing woman whose supposedly perfect life she would fantasize whenever she travelled by their home, located along the tracks, on her daily trains travels."
663,Anjana Menon,"It’s not very often that I find a book that I can devour in one sitting, but this one had me hooked. I kept hearing incredible things about it, and over a long weekend, I finally got around to reading it.The story is told from the perspective of three women who are central to the plot. The first person we meet is Rachel – an infuriating alcoholic who deserves a good shaking. She’s selfish, unemployed, drinks a wee bit much and constantly blacks out, and is just so annoyingly unreliable. Her stalker behaviour would drive anyone nuts. You think she’s lost it right at the beginning, as she takes the train into work everyday from Ashbury to Euston (pretty certain that would drain her bank account). Through her, we meet both Anna and Megan, who infuriate you even more. But that’s the best part – what makes this book a masterpiece is the way the author has painted these flawed characters. You want to keep reading and find out which one of them is the worst out of all of them.There are plenty of comparisons online to Gone Girl. Whilst the characters will probably remind you of Nick and Amy in parts, I can’t see much of a similarity – except that they’re both psychological thrillers. I also think that Gone Girl has more of a ‘surprise’ element to it.But chances are that you’ll like this one if you’re a fan of Gillian Flynn’s book. I recommend adding this to your reading list. Clearly, the combination of public drunkenness, infidelity, murder, and lies are a pretty good combo."
664,Winter Sophia Rose,"Dark, Gripping, Haunting & Captivating! I Loved It!!!"
665,Nikki Oden,"This book was fantastic. It's one of those books that you wanted to talk about so badly the whole time I was reading it and then the minute I finished I needed to talk to anyone I knew who had read the book. Hawkins does an amazing job of slowly revealing evidence, by switching narrators and through flashbacks, so by the time the answers are revealed the reader has all the pieces. Because of this I felt like the ending was very well thought out and intentional, which tends to be my biggest complaint in murder mysteries. Often times I feel like authors want so badly to shock us they don't develop the evidence throughout the course of the story. Hawkins ins't trying for pure shock value. I truly felt like she wanted the readers to play detective and figure it out as they went. None of the characters can be trusted and everyone is a suspect. I've heard critics of the book say this made the characters unlikable and there was no one worth rooting for. First, I don't think we need to like the characters to like the story and second, I don't think it's true. At the beginning of the book Rachel, the protagonist, presents the reader with the idea that everyone is broken. As we chip away at each character's exterior we realize this to be true. Every character in the story is flawed, just like people in real life. I felt like aside from the murder mystery this was one of the major themes of the novel and it develops so beautifully as we get to know each of the characters better. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good mystery and anyone who likes digging for clues and putting the pieces all together. "
666,Roxanne Walker,Wow wow wow .... Didn't see that ending! So much better than Gone Girl! 
667,Vanessa Marie Reddy,"I am not one who reads books from the thriller genre. However, on a visit to the local bookshop, I was drawn in by the cover of the book. The blurred title of this, what I can only describe as irresistible read, drew me in. I started reading this book late night and landed up having lack of sleep as I could not simply call it a night until my eyes literally shut close from exhaustion. This book was so unpredictable and compulsive that I just wanted to read until there wasn't anything left to read. The characters are fantastic. I cannot praise these characters enough. I was entirely hooked on their words. I loved the style of writing used as it just placed you in the minds of these characters. I felt like I knew Rachel and Megan as though they were people I have met rather than characters in a book. The story itself is enthralling. It literally kept me up most of the night trying to piece together different clues and and information to form an accurate theory before the real truth was revealed. I must admit, I was pretty close as to my theory of who did what, but it was not without overthinking every detail on every page. Even then I could not help but be shocked by the actual ending of the story. This is nothing short of excellent. As I said, I am not a person who reads thrillers, but if this is anything to go by, I will be adding some more thrillers to my book shelf. "
668,Diep,Great read. It kept me guessing the whole time. 
669,Beppie,"To paraphrase one of my favorite childhood books...""I think I can! I think I can! I think I can..."" say this book took me on quite a train ride!! I am pleased to say that I deduced ""who done it"" early on in the read, but even given that, I was in it to the very end!"
670,Sarah Fernández,Me ENCANTOOO dios es demasiado bueno y no paras de leerlo aunque las primeras 40 paginas son un poco lentas la autora supo como amarrarte a seguir leyendo hasta el final. Definitivamente le doy 5 estrellas. Es un excelente libro se los recomiendo a todos
671,Michele Miller,"This is an excellent book, as intriguing as Gone Girl but with a good ending (which Gone Girl lacked in my view). The Girl on the Train is very original with the main character battling alcoholism and set back by severe blackouts. I can't go into detail about any small quibbles there without spoiling surprises; but, frankly, my few moments of incredulity didn't dampen my enthusiasm for the book as a whole. I highly recommend this novel as an very imaginative story that kept me enthralled from beginning to end. It was fun to be tricked, too, although I hate to admit it. "
672,Jennifer Lafferty,"This book is truly amazing. I loved it! It is fascinating,thrilling, beyond suspenseful, character-driven and very entertaining. It's the kind of book that really is impossible to put down after a certain point; Definitely not your typical mystery novel. Those who compare the book to ""Gone Girl"" and call it Hitchcockian are absolutely right. I urge all fiction fans to read it not just those who like mysteries, as it is so much more than a mystery. "
673,Janine Kovac,Devoured it. Gave it my sister. She devoured it. I loved how much empathy I felt for such a flawed narrator. 
674,Marissa Farrar,"This is a psychological thriller which reminded me of Gone Girl in the fact someone had been murdered and none of the characters are particularly likeable. This is where the similarities end though. Even though none of the characters are likeable, they are understandable in their bad choices. The Girl On The Train is Rachel, a recently divorced woman who is also an alcoholic and her life is in tatters. The train journey she takes into London each day also take her past the back of her old house, where her ex and his new family now live. Though she watches this house from the train window, she also watches that of her old neighbours, Scott and Megan. One day Megan goes missing, and Rachel thinks she has seen something that can help, but her memories are clouded from the amount of alcohol she drinks. What starts as a bit of nosiness, draws her into the murder of her ex-neighbour and she learns that everyone has secrets and lives are never as perfect as they might appear on the surface.This was a definite page turner for me. I could relate to the characters, even their bad points, and I felt for them, which always makes a good book for me. It when I don't care about the characters that I stop reading! This is a must read for all fans of the genre."
675,Tammy,This book is absolutely riveting. I couldn't put it down!
676,Pam Spangler,Fun!I thought this book was great! A fun read - it was hard to follow in the beginning but was much easier to follow as I continued to read. I highly recommend reading this........
677,Daniela Rodrigues,"Adorei! Não se tornou um dos meus livros favoritos, é certo, mas prendeu-me e entusiasmou-me. Dava por mim a pensar no que teria acontecido. A querer ter pausas no trabalho para ler um pouco mais.Inicialmente, andei um pouco perdida, confesso. Gosto de policiais, do mistério, da curiosidade em saber quem fez o quê e porquê. Neste livro, estas dúvidas surgem mais tarde, mas quando isso acontece... "
678,Doug Bradshaw,"Rachel, who is a bit like me, and I couldn't help but almost become Rachel in this brilliant little riveting story, is divorced, has lost her job, is undisciplined, gaining weight and has a definite drinking problem. But she means well and is determined to quit drinking, to get a new job and to move on from her divorce. And yet, she can't quite do any of the things necessary to get her life back together. She spies on her ex and his beautiful new wife and kid, she gets up every morning and takes the train to London, pretending she's still employed and in the meantime, she watches people from the train, especially one couple who seem to have the life she has always wanted, real love, a new child, they are both attractive and loving to each other, and yet....Some of the things I think make this book an outstanding read:1. Brilliant authors seem to understand and convey human emotions and psychology in a story. We're used to the protagonist being some kind of outstanding or heroic individual and then cheering him or her on as they make it through the many obstacles. In this story, Rachel is rather average and her life has fallen apart and yet somehow, she becomes a sympathetic character that I cared deeply for even though almost every step of the way, she is messing up, looks bad, dwells on the past, is awkwardly drunk over and over again, tells a lot of white lies and tries to cover up her miserable existence. It's heartbreaking, perhaps like having a kid or a brother or sister who is just a screw-up but you can never give up on them because there always seems to be a chance that they will do better, change. 2. It delves well into relationships and control issues and how hard life really is sometimes. And how immature people do immature things. How men and women fight and are always seeking love and companionship and how tough that seems to achieve. None of the main characters are really what they appear to be on the surface. Some are liars, some are cheaters, some are conmen and women, and all disappointingly selfish and wounded. And sometimes, things move to a terrifying and horrible level. Maybe our average failure of a gal is really the best of the lot.3. The story moves along at a good pace and the actions of the main characters come together well, the story unfolding gradually and believably and there's no predictable ending. I was worried and nervous right to the very end. 4. For me, if after the end of the book I still want to hear more about the main characters, wondering if maybe there will be a sequel (in this case I doubt it), if I want to help them, check in on them, the book is a success. It is absolutely the case here.I highly recommend this one. "
679,Amber,"Ok it's time to be quizzical. I have started this review before completely finishing this book, although I am near the end. I will have finished the book by the time I'm done with this review. I'm sympathetic to Rachel. Who wouldn't be? I also just want her really badly to not be the killer I also don't want her to be killed by Scott if he is the killer or if there is a series of very extreme turns near the end I think it's also possible that her ex husband could be the killer seeing as how Megan had many lovers. I'm completely engrossed at this point and I feel like I've very clearly thought this out that the ending is going to be one of these possibilities. 1)Rachel herself killed Megan by mistake in a drunken stupor. 2)Scott her husband killed her and will also kill Rachel.3) Rachel's ex husband Tom killed Megan (and was also secretly romantic with her) 4) the lover/therapist killed her. 5)the drunk red haired man from the train is a serial killer and killed Megan and will also kill Rachel. I think the story is going to end with most likely number 1 possibly 3. Those seem like the most unpredictable of endings. Reading throughout this story I don't like the character Anna because she is a homewrecker. I can't help but be suspicious of her too like she is involved some how. I like Rachel but I don't like her roommate to much. I don't like how Rachel is so obsessed with her ex and I wish she would be a stronger woman and move on. I especially didn't like how near the end Tom jealously confronts Rachel about her seeing Scott and she feels guilty. At that point I want to smack her around. I love the story thus far and am now going to finish the end to see how far off bass I am.Now that I've finished I was surprised and also not surprised at the same time. It was a great story and I can see how it won the best Goodreads thriller of the year. Also I do like trains. "
680,Ben,"Loved this book! I did the audiobook with three different narrators and thought it was amazing. The author does a great job of building the case against multiple suspects at the same time so you are kept guessing until the big reveal. It is also adept at addressing (minor thematic spoilers) infidelity and loss and addiction and domestic violence. It's a tight cast and three different narrators, so it might seem ponderous, but the mystery is unwrapped between the perspectives so nicely. Great pacing. Fun read!"
681,Aseel,"It makes you feeling edgy & gets you addicted from the beginning with being emotional and dark. With the touch of a bit of psychoanalysis and turning the suspense up with a chapter for each character...It's the perfect mix of Moriaty & Flynn. That disturbing ""fuckedupness""Hope that the movie will be as good as the book not done in haste like gone girl"
682,Eva,"Read it in a total of 5 hours I think. I could not stop reading. Finished it in 2 days. The story is divided in short chapters which alternately tells the story of Megan and Rachel. I think this is one of the reasons why this book was so easy to read. Fast pace, lots of twists and turns, absolutely loved it. Everytime I thought I figured out who did it, something in the story pushes me in another direction. This is definitely a must-read, especially for thriller-fans. Do not skip this book! I will keep an eye on Paula Hawkins, because if this is a hint of more to come... I will always be satisfied ^^ "
683,Eve,Total guilty pleasure. The perfect page turner for a rainy January day.
684,Mary Edgley,"The girl on a trainAn alcoholic fantasist with a failed marriage, a lost career and a hopeless future is odd type casting for a main character. The daily routine of commuting, ordinary people living ordinary lives in the suburbs, the dullness of working for a living in a city of millions is not a glittering locus in quo for a psychological thriller. People not being exactly as they portray themselves is nothing unusual. The author takes these mundane facets of life, creates ever evolving characters (could be you, your mate, your aunt....) and weaves a simple but perplexing tale that draws you in and makes you revise your understanding of the plot almost chapter by chapter. The tension is quietly palpable leading to an eye-opening finale. Excellent! The very ordinariness of it adds to the tension. A wordsmith of note, I will read more by this author."
685,Anita Marcoff,"Amazing, fast paced, so many twists and turns. Difficult to put down."
686,Mary Gent,"After the phenomenon of Gone Girl, the unreliable narrator trope has become all the rage. Of course we all know there are legendary characters throughout literary history who are famously ""unreliable"", but never has the trend been so prevalent. The narrators in this grim novel are all untrustworthy. The main ""voice"" of Rachel was particularly difficult to labor through. Her broken down, alcoholic, complete mess of a life was harrowing. I hated her and felt sorry for her. Anyone who has struggled with alcoholism will feel that familiar hangover, that poisonous rotten taste that lingers on the breath and the deathly fear of the blackout's many secrets. It was hard for me at times to tolerate her weakness. The pain of a philandering husband is something many of us are well acquainted with but I found myself disgusted by her collapse of character but then that is the point. The other two narrators are equally as stomach churning. Women without backbones. Women without strength. Women who hated themselves and used men to fill that void. And also that predatory evil that can only reside within a woman's insecurities. The plot is riveting and compulsive. I was pulled in and then got lost in this triumvirate of pain and horror. The twists and turns of a missing woman and the affect it has on everyone in the story. I figured out the mystery rather early on but that didn't stop me from spending hours ravenously turning pages to get to the end. Like Gone Girl, it made me feel that the true nature of what women are capable of had been revealed. We are complicated creatures who grow weary with the predictability of the opposite sex. It is an engaging read and left me feeling a bit lost and alone as a woman on the other side of a failed marriage but with the flicker of hope that the rawness of womanhood is being unleashed by these captivating women writers. Bravo!"
687,Timo,"Ever sat on a train or bus, looking out of the window and imagining what's going on in those houses? I'm a bit like this. Sometimes I stop and wonder what all those people around me are up to. They all have a life as complex as mine, and for them I'm just an extra in a movie, instantly forgotten. This is where this book starts.
""I watch the people I pass - the two men running, backpacks on, training for the marathon, the young woman in a black skirt and white trainers, heels in her bag, on her way to work - and I wonder what they're hiding. Are they moving to stop drinking, running to stand still?""
I enjoyed it immensely. It's a clever written thriller that is very fast paced but doesn't leave character building behind. There are different viewpoints from 3 main characters which are perfectly spaced, giving you just enough information to keep you guessing.People keep drawing comparisons to Gone Girl, but I don't think that gives Paula Hawkins's work justice. While Gone Girl has loosely a similar tone and story, The Girl on the Train is a different kind of beast. Yes there are twists that I didn't saw coming, but it's less of a heavy character study and more a realistic chain of events where bad things happen to good (or are they?) people.And this is why this book gets 5 stars from me. It's realistic. So realistic that it's scary. The Girl on the Train must be the first thriller I've read, where every action from every character just made sense. Everything done and said happened exactly like I thought it should. And not needing to shout at the characters for their foolishness, was a nice change. "
688,Karen & Gerard,"WOW! This book is so good! I got into all the characters really fast. It is great writing and the twists in the story are very good with a fantastic ending! I LOVED IT! Once I got into this, it was hard to put down. It will be hard to find a better book than this one.(Gerard's review)"
689,Dana Trumpower,"It has been compared to Gone Girl, but I liked this a lot better! I am still trying to figure out why. Maybe because these characters were more real, and struggling with real problems, then the whacked out ""amazing Amy"" of Gone Girl. I think the background story in the beginning was enough to get you interested without being too drawn out. I liked the way the background continued to be filled in right to the end to round out the motivations of the characters."
690,Nicholas Kaufmann,"This was a very well written mystery with a vivid cast of characters, including an unreliable drunk as the amateur sleuth. Frankly, I loved it! The characters were thoroughly messed up and complex, the use of unreliable narration was well handled, the mystery was compelling enough to keep my attention, and the unusual structure appealed to me. The novel is basically written as a series of monologues by the three main female characters, so that it almost feels like you're reading their diary entries, and the chapters are divided into morning and evening sections to mimic the average commuting schedule of the train that plays such an important role in the story. Mostly, though, I can't stress enough how great the character work is. These people are royally screwed up, and some of them turn out to be truly awful people even when you feel bad for them, but they are believably complicated and their faults remain relatable. (Not counting the killer's, of course.) I guessed whodunit long before the end, but I don't blame the author for that. I've read, studied, and written enough mysteries myself to recognize the tricks Hawkins employs. Ultimately, this novel reminded me of GONE GIRL and DARE ME in the best ways. Highly recommended for readers who like mysteries, thrillers, and incredibly well drawn character studies."
691,Vicki Curtis,I liked it! It was hard to put down!
692,Ariel Lanier,"I was so happy I picked this book up, especially since it has been a bestseller. I am usually not into these types of books, I actually found most of it really depressing and even a little paranoid. BUT after reading the entire thing, it was incredible. I simply could not put it down, literally stayed up until 2 AM finishing it. It was a quick read and very sad but WOW, the ending was a bit of a surprise. Loved it!"
693,Moe,It was so dark with fucked up characters. And also was brilliantly written and unputdownable. It kept me guessing all the way through. I really enjoyed this thriller.
694,Jenn,"No spoilers ... I wasn't sure where this book was going, and the multi-perspective narration threw me a little, but I did find that I was sucked in and that the book picked up speed, hurtling towards the end like a freight train. Definitely a great read!"
695,Jena,"WHAT? . . . THE HELL?This book broke my mind.I don't know what else to say except, read it!"
696,Maria Paiz,"Sometimes we look at other people's lives and believe they're perfect, especially when we compare them --negatively, usually-- to our own, reminding ourselves of our faults, our lacks, our unfulfilled wants. In this story, a woman named Rachel takes the train to and from London every day, going past a group of houses she knows well. She lived in one of those houses before, when she was happy --or so she told herself, as she remembered being married to Tom, a man she drove to infidelity through her drinking. Four doors down live Jason and Jess, the perfect golden couple in their perfect golden house. Except their names aren't Jason and Jess. Rachel doesn't know them, but every day as she peeks into their lives from the train, she makes up details that make them real to her. They're happy, they're in love, they have everything she lacks. And then one day, Rachel sees something unexpected, something that shatters her illusion and changes her life.I never expected this book to be so intense! It is a keen psychological thriller that pokes into the thoughts and motivations of its characters. Rachel and her alcoholism, her guilt and shame, constantly berating herself as she descends further down into the dark chasms of her addiction. How rational her insanity seems, as she tries to understand her own actions, both drunk and sober. Megan, petite and bird-like, blonde and beautiful, haunted by a secret so dark it cripples her ability to live the careless life she is offered by her husband. And Anna, a fierce lioness when it comes to protecting her family, even in the face of questions that may fracture everything she loves.This book made me think how sometimes we believe what we want to believe: how love is an illusion because we tend to love the story we choose about the other person, as long as that story suits us. This is also a book about the lies we tell, both to others and to ourselves. A gripping thriller that kept me on my toes --highly recommendable!"
697,Karen Mills,Great summer read! I read it on the train!
698,Sharon,This was such a page turner! Really kept you guessing! Great read!
699,Heather,"Why is this book at the top of everyone's must-read list? Because it's fabulous!! I am a voracious reader, with at least 2 books going at all times. At the ripe old age of 44, I now know what I like, and this book had it all! A mystery chock full of thrills? Check! Break neck pacing? Check! Fully formed characters with plausible motivations and actions? Check again. I figured out the mystery before the big reveal, and that still didn't leave me disappointed!! Eager to see what else Hawkins can create."
700,Grace Elliot,"An immersive absorbing read that I couldn't wait to return to and thought about when I wasn't reading it. Exactly what you want in a good page turner, believable characters and a disaster slowly unfurling with one person on the track of truth who no ones believes. Only one point bugged me: With the price of train tickets what they are, how on earth could Rachel afford to commute daily with no job??? [Minor point that didn't detract from the book] "
701,Penelope Irving,"This is a terrfically exciting, page turning psychological thriller - whodunnit - or what? Not quite sure how to categorise it. Probably thriller, with contemporary women's fiction elements.Rachael's life is in a mess. Her husband left her two years before for another woman, she hasn't been able to have a child, she's living in a semi-friend's spare room and she's sinking into alcoholism. She has also lost her job - despite this, she's been taking the morning and evening commuter train into central London every day, in order to maintain a facade of employment. The train nearly always stops at a signal just at the bottom of the gardens to a street of terraced houses, and it happens to be the street where Rachael used to live with her husband.Watching these houses every day while the train halts, Rachael has become mildly obsessed with a couple who have moved in three doors down from where her ex-husband still lives with his new wife and their baby. She often sees a pretty girl out in the garden terrace with her handsome husband, and begins to fantasise about the perfect life that they must lead together. Until one day, she sees the girl embracing a man who is not her husband - and the next day, the girl goes missing. After this, the story moves at a smooth, taut pace as Rachael gets drawn deeper and deeper into the mystery and the real life of that perfect couple. I can't say much in detail about the plot as all of it would be spoilers, and I think it's definitely better to read this book with as little idea as possible of what's coming. I have to say that it touches on themes that I personally find upsetting, and I would probably not have chosen to read it had I known about a couple of the dark places it goes - so I'm glad I didn't know in advance, because this is just a fantastic read and I would have missed out.Thoroughly recommended."
702,Kay   ✾◕ ‿ ◕✾ ,you don't have to like the characters. they all have dark sides. go for the mystery. the story runs in circles and won't give you an idea who baddest person is until you've read 80%. it will gut you at some points too. you'll empathize with the characters and feel frustrated with them. 
703,joanie shabala,A Freaking Wonderful NovelThe best book I have read in months..EVERYTHING is just so crazy..couldn't put it down...LOVE LOVE LOVE this book..BRAVO.....would recommend to anyone!!!!
704,Christopher Carrolli,"Rachel rides a train into London every day, passing houses, glimpsing through windows, and wondering what’s going on behind them. Riding the train every day is a front, a cover to establish her absence on a daily basis. Secretly, she’s lost her job, a result of her drinking problem, a reality she must hide from her roommate. There is one house in particular that she passes every day. It used to be hers, until Tom, her husband, divorced her for Anna. Now, Tom and Anna live happily with their baby girl in her house, while Rachel wallows in alcoholic sorrow, eking out her means of survival. She drinks daily, suffers blackouts, and is one step away from being thrown out onto the street.There is another house that Rachel passes every day, one belonging to a romantic and admirable young couple. She sees them ever day. She fantasizes about who they are and what their lives are like. The appearance of their blissful coexistence gives her some kind of unexplainable hope. She’s even given them fictitious names—“Jess and Jason.” Then one day, Rachel sees something that catches her attention, the possibility of existing infidelity in the young couple’s perfect world. Then, she sees something even more mysterious.Paula Hawkins’ “The Girl on the Train” is a well paced, page turning, and fascinating read. Her characters are finely sketched, realistic, and genuinely crafted. The mystery is consistent and leaves the reading guessing from the point when Rachel sees “Jess’s” face splashed across the newspaper, to the final climax. The fictitious “Jess” is a young woman named Megan, who lives only a few doors down from Tom and Anna. She has suddenly gone missing. Hawkins tells the story through the first person accounts of Rachel, Megan, and Anna, interwoven throughout the book, and with a talent well versed in Agatha Christie.Rachel hits rock bottom and rebounds into high wire-walking sobriety. She begins to examine two of the possible suspects; Megan’s husband, Scott, and Megan’s lover—her therapist. She learns many things about the suspects and many truths about Megan as the mystery thickens. Then, Rachel’s memories about a certain night begin to return as her recovery progresses. She’s not believable to the police; she’s been involved in past boundary issues with Tom and Anna and deemed a stalker. As Rachel’s mind clears, so does the mystery, which leads to the nail biting end.Paula Hawkins is an amazing new mystery author. Her next book should be anxiously awaited. “The Girl on the Train” is slated to become a feature film in 2016. Let’s hope it lives up to the book."
705,Tracy Fenton,wow..what a debut novel. gripping and gritty and scary in places. I loved all 3 characters and didn't see the twist coming until it literally smacked me in the face. highly recommend
706,Jeri,"I ""read"" this book as a book on tape as I was driving from Florida to Pennsylvania. I am pretty sure if I had had the book in my hand, I would have read it in a day! Hearing the ""conversations"" between characters really kept things intense! So many twists and turns I felt I was on a roller coaster. The moment I knew what had happened was surprising, but the enormity of the happening was even more so. "
707,Riann Mohar,Guys! This is a good one! It's not quite as twisted as Gone Girl but still has surprises and an ending that did not leave me questioning if these characters would really tie it all up like that. I love an unreliable narrator and there are 3 of them in this book.
708,H Stone,Very good! I liked it better than Gone Girl
709,Fatema Danyal,"HEAVY SPOILERS AHEADI was struggling between 4 stars and 5 stars and decided to go with a 5 because this book is honestly that good.People comparing it to Gone Girl are wrong in many ways but the major for me being that this book had an ending. And ending distinguishable from the whole story. My biggest problem with Gone Girl was that it eventually ended exactly where it started only with all the cards open and a kid in picture.Let's talk characters, shall we...Each and everyone is a friggin nutjob. Every character in this book has some sort of Mental disorder or is crazy in some way.Megan, with her crazy idea of victory when Tom kept coming to her and her wanting more than what she already had;Scott with his anger issues and, well, sleeping with a woman months after your wife's death ain't normal;Anna with the blind love and nervousness syndrome;Cathy with her constant sorrys;Rachel with her need to be involved and stalking;And the Lord of all the Crackpots, Tom, who literally had a need to lie and severe anger issues.Maybe that's what made the book so readable, you couldn't, as a reader, trust one single person. Hell, even the psychiatrist was in love with his patient.It is the best feeling when in a fast paced suspense killer, the bad guy gets his just desserts and that happened here.This book is great and no wonder everyone is loving it."
710,John Fish,"Paula Hawkins debut novel is the ultimate psychological thriller that will keep your pulses racing until the very last page.The story is narrated through the eyes and pen of Rachel a lonely somewhat miserable young woman who drinks a lot, let’s face it Rachel is an alcoholic. Every morning she commutes by train to London to work, there is also a fantasy going on here as she see the same couple every day from the window of her carriage and creates a fantasy world for this couple. What we then realise here is that the sub plot is that this couple live just a few doors away from Rachel’s ex-husband Tom and his new wife Anna. The narration from Rachel is something that makes The Girl on the Train something very special and incredibly insightful from a woman whose life really has come off the rails. Through the narration you begin to understand how Rachel lives a life through a glass and if often so drunk she has no memory of what has happened in her life. She has had a drink problem for quite some time and the fact that she lost her job because of it adds to the mystery of her daily train journeys into London.Many reviews I have read of Paula Hawkins debut novel said they could not show any empathy with Rachel, yet I totally became involved with her and she stands out to me more so than any of the other lead characters, yet I am not entirely sure why, I put this down to the incredible skill of Hawkins writing and how she has portrayed Rachel. When Megan goes missing Rachel believes she holds vital information as what happened, but alas Rachel’s memory is vague to say the least and struggles to recall exact details and the frustration that bubbles to the surface in this taught thriller. Add to this that Rachel continues to harass her ex-husband, lies and is viewed with incredible amount of suspicion by those around her. Rachel decides to take it upon herself to get involved in the investigation into the disappearance of Megan and also those very close to the investigation. There is a real twist to the end of the story that will keep you gripped until the very last moments as Rachel finally recalls some detail from one of her previous blackouts. There is so much more to The Girl on the Train that it is at times completely unpredictable a clever and refreshingly brilliant thriller.With the huge success of Gillian Flynn’s Gone Girl still very much fresh in our minds, 2015 has seen some brilliant thrillers based around poisonous relationships but without a shadow of doubt The Girl on the Train is the runaway success of the year and a global smash hit and with a film now due to hit the screens late 2016 staring Emily Blunt in the lead role will surely be just as successful on the screen as the book has been through 2015.If you have been living anywhere other than this planet and you have not yet experienced The Girl on the Train, make this a Christmas book choice to curl up with over the holidays and experience what the rest of the World has in this roller-coaster of a modern psychological thriller. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
711,Gail,"Is ""The Girl on the Train"" destined to be the Blockbuster Breakout of 2015? It's sure shaping up to be. I've gotta admit, now that I stayed up late last night, then rose early this morning to finish (in that delicious hour before anyone else, when reading feels like the guiltiest pleasure), HECK YEAH IT IS. All the buzz for this is that it's the ""next Gone Girl"" and it's an apt comparison. Only instead of one unreliable female narrator, Paula Hawkins' gives us three--all great, all wanting something different and yet, in so many ways, the same thing. There is Rachel, the drunk who starts the story with her keen observations aboard her daily train into London; Megan, the woman Rachel sees from the train whose life she fantasizes about (though for reasons she'll soon discover, shouldn't); and Anna, the one who unites them, whose philandering gives her what she wants yet will burn her in the end.The book is fast-paced and leaves you guessing until a point where, even though you suspect the outcome, you still plow through to find out how Hawkins takes you to the end. As I often do, I read some articles on the book and discovered the author sold ""The Girl on the Train"" on a partial manuscript (fewer than 100 pages and an outline): If you're unfamiliar with how the publishing world works, you should know this is EXTREMELY rare. Meaning her agent and her editors all knew she was on to something (and what a satisfying something it was--particularly that ending...I loved the last line and the way it brought the story full-circle).In interviews she gives, Hawkins seems surprised at the book's success, but she should hold on--the buzz is only going to build from here. As the bookseller in this article noted, “The Girl on the Train is intense, and it’s in an Internet sense ‘shareable ...by that I mean, once you read it you want your friends to read it too so you can talk about it. Once a book becomes viral like that, there’s no slowing it down.” (Source: http://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/b...)So yeah, prepare yourself to hear a LOT about this one, if you haven't already. And if you want to talk about it afterward, well, I'm all ears!"
712,Steve Sarner,"Girl on the Train could easily be entitled Girl on the Train Wreak. Nevertheless, I found this to be a very entertaining read and I think the movie will be a thriller too.I don't give many books 5 stars but GOTT hit my personal criteria to earn the top rating from me. My approach to star ratings is based on my eagerness to continue reading a particular book. Three stars means I look forward to continuing and probably finishing the book at some point. Four stars equates to looking very forward to picking up the story again soon and will finish it for sure. And 5 stars indicates that I actually rearrange my schedule and priorities to continue reading the book and finish it asap. GOTT started as a 3 star for me but, quickly went to 4. At about the halfway point it moved to a 5 as I became more engrossed and connected to the characters and intrigued with the mystery of what’s coming next (as well as what Rachel was going to drink next)I particularly enjoyed the format of breaking the happenings of the days, and therefore the story, into two parts – morning and evening and also stating the dates. It gave the book a manageable and predictable pace around a number of unpredictable turns. It also allowed me to keep organized around the different players and, of course, the time frames too. The fact that I had a visceral frustration with the characters as the story unfolded speaks to the effectiveness of Hawkins writing. I can fully appreciate why this was a Goodreads choice award for 2015. "
713,Lindsey Robbins,"I wasn't sure I'd like this book when I started but the thing about reading a book for a book club is that is makes me keep reading when I might have otherwise stopped. And in this case, I'm glad I kept reading. The further I got into the book the more hooked I became. I was dying to figure out what happened and Rachel's black-outs just added to that suspense and mystery. I felt for her as a character because I believed she was a good person who just needed help."
714,Allyson Abu-hajar,"This has got to be by far the most intriguing book, I have read this year! I highly recommend reading this book. This is a new author for me, and this is her first thriller. This story is told from many point of views, it starts out with Rachel, who daily rides the train, each day she passes by one house, where she notices a couple. She envisions that this couple is perfect and dreams up their ideal life; even giving them names of Jess and Jason, who really are Scott and Megan Hipwell. Rachel has made a mess of her own life. Rachel drinks too much, and it is easy to get annoyed with her for not seeing the destruction, she is bringing into her life. She is divorced from Tom Watson, who is remarried to Anna, and Rachel is living with her friend Cathy. The story is told from Rachel, Anna and Megan's view. As the story unfolds, one begins to understand what leads to Rachel's drinking, then one day as the train goes by, Rachel saw something that involves the couple, that she deems perfect. After a newscast, Rachel realizes that maybe what she saw is vital information, and goes to the police. Rachel gets drawn in further and further into the investigation, but is she helping or hindering it?"
715,Dawn K,"What a ride! I read this in 1 1/2 days. Great from start to finish.Rachel is such a wonderful character. Both good and bad. I really felt for her.If you love thrillers, give this one a read. You won't be disappointed."
716,Tani,"Two damaged characters are the main contributors to this storyline. Their everyday lives have been shattered by their past, so as you discover their backstory, you also uncover the mystery of their present situation. I gave this book five stars because I felt that the two protagonists are very well described as they react to some of womankind's oldest problems (but I don't want to give any spoilers). Also, the book is perfectly paced and entertaining the whole way through while still managing to be a well executed literary work."
717,Jennifer Kampmann,Very good! Didn't suspect the ending!
718,Sebastiaan Leeman,"Terrific read. Main character sticks with you. The writer releases information of the plot carefully, and this contributes to the addictiveness of this book. Can't wait for Hawkins to release her second novel."
719,Kelley Wood,One of the best thrillers I've read! Highly recommend you carve out enough time to read in one sitting. The suspense is killer! 
720,Ilaria,"Sarebbero 4 e mezzo le stelle! Comunque davvero gran bella storia, l'ho trovata molto originale. Lettura molto scorrevole, l'unica pecca è che la parte più intrigante è concentrata tutta nelle ultime 100 pagine. Ma è un libro che consiglio a tutti coloro a cui piacciono i thriller. "
721,Manuela Santos,"“Ela está enterrada à sombra de uma bétula, ali junto aos velhos carris do comboio, com uma lápide a assinalar o túmulo. Não passa de um montículo de pedras, aliás. Eu não queria atrair atenções para a sua última morada, mas também não a poderia deixar sem lembrança. Há-de descansar em paz ali, sem que alguém a venha perturbar, sem outra companhia além do canto dos pássaros e do troar dos comboios a passarem.”Antes de começar a escrever a opinião, quero informar que estive quase para desistir de ler o livro.Perguntam vocês porquê?Porque bastantes pessoas se manifestaram muito antes do livro sair, e quando o quis comprar já estava saturada de opiniões, umas boas outras menos boas e por aí fora.Relativamente ao livro, é a história de três mulheres com personalidades e vidas diferentes, com altos e baixos, umas mais sofridas, traumatizadas e perturbadas psicologicamente. Rachel, Megan e Anna relatam-nos as suas vidas nestas páginas onde se entrelaçam histórias pessoais. Rachel é o elo de ligação entre elas e cabe-lhe a função da descoberta do mistério.Rachel é uma mulher igual a tantas outras, com defeitos, qualidades, virtudes e sentimentos. Como ela, muitas de nós que utilizamos o comboio como meio de transporte para o trabalho, e do trabalho para casa, deparamo-nos basicamente com a rotina do dia-a-dia. A mesma carruagem, as mesmas pessoas, as mesmas conversas e os mesmos panoramas.Rachel é uma mulher com problemas que no comboio vai fantasiando os seus filmes. Ela viaja duas vezes por dia na mesma linha, e a viagem faz-se na zona onde ela habitava antigamente. Olhando através da janela ela imagina vidas perfeitas com casais que habitam nas moradias adjacentes à linha. Ela até nome dá aos habitantes. Com uma depressão acentuada ela refugia-se no álcool e tem constantemente perdas de memórias, acredita nas mentiras que vai dizendo e no que vai recordando.Mas um certo dia Rachel presencia algo que a deixa inquieta, foi uma questão de segundos, mas a imagem que presume ser verdadeira e não querendo guardar segredo, decide contar à polícia.A partir daqui tudo pode acontecer e o suspense e novos acontecimentos se vão suceder! Depois de entrarmos na viagem, não mais vamos querer sair sem saber o sucedido.A autora explorou bem a situação do assassinato, quem matou quem e os efeitos do álcool no nosso sistema nervoso, causando dependência, provocando modificações de carácter, sonolência, depressão, desconcentração e até desmaios. Mostra-nos que ninguém tem uma vida perfeita, todas as pessoas têm problemas devem é saber lidar com eles. Os personagens muito bem construídos e desenvolvidos, quando pensamos que certo personagem tem a personalidade (X) de repente verificamos que afinal não é (X) mas sim (Y).As minhas viagens de comboio nunca mais vão ser as mesmas. A minha visão sobre as casas coladas à linha do comboio a partir daqui vai ser completamente diferente. A minha mente como é bastante fértil começa a imaginar o que se passará dentro daquelas paredes. As conversas, os hábitos, os costumes e as atitudes!A escrita da autora é simples, directa, pausada e atractiva.A leitura é intensa, contagiante, delirante, envolvente, compulsiva, surpreendente, emocionante, arrepiante, alucinante e empolgante.Uma história que mexe com os nossos mais sinceros sentimentos. São emoções atrás de emoções, e a autora prendeu-me ao seu enredo da primeira à última página.É uma viagem carregada de suspense, inseguranças, transtornos, mistério, intriga, segredos, opressão, recordações, alegrias, tristezas e fragilidades. Estamos perante um thriller psicológico intenso que recomendo sem reservas e, bem dita a hora que lhe peguei.O final é soberbo e encaixa na perfeição.Obrigada TopSeller e 20|20 por mais um livro incrível, belíssimo, viciante e intrigante, superou em muito as minhas expectativas.Não deixem de ler “A Rapariga no Comboio” como eu estava fazendo.Recomendo sem reservas a autora Paula Hawkins que irei seguir sem dúvida alguma.Excelente 5*****"
722,Kandi Steiner,"Loved it! A thriller much like Gone Girl with narrators you can't help but relate to - flaws and all. The author does a great job of making you guess until the very end ""who dunnit"" and once you find out, you'll catch yourself second guessing everything you thought you knew about Rachel. Wonderfully written and a solid 5 star read!"
723,M.M. Charles,This book was a complete mindf*ck!!! SERIOUSLY!!!! It was one of the best novels I read! READ THIS BOOK!!!!
724,Teresa Crawford,"Wow - a book written about real people! You never know what goes on behind closed doors. You never know what makes someone do the things they do. You never really realize how people are connected until you go digging around. Everyone in this book has something to hide, and they all could be guilty of murder, but only one is a true killer."
725,Emmett Hoops,"This was one of the most engaging books I've come across this year. It's hard to give credence to the negative reviews, because it's quite likely they never read the book in its entirety. Many people have a difficult time with the first 50 pages of any book, and one notices such reviews rarely give details. This book takes unreliable narrators to a wholly new level. Perspectives keep changing. You find yourself asking, ""Are my predictions based on unsound thinking, provided by an unsound narrator?"" In fact, the reader is never quite sure of anything but the inexorable progress of the central mystery. The solution is like an image in a thick fog, a life-size figure that only becomes visible as various narrators' points of view coalesce. It is a wonderful thing to see a talented author use such a daring literary device to such astonishing effect."
726,Isabel,Slow confusing start (partly because I didn't read a description of the book and never took note of the dates) but man once I caught on to the story it was a page turner. 
727,Kaylee Gwyn,"4.5 StarsWhoa. I mean, this is a good book. I was so doubtful when everyone kept referring to it like Gone Girl (mostly just because it's a well written thriller to from a female POV written by a female), but I'm glad I jumped on this train (pun intended). Rachel - I loved this character. I think she embodies that side of everyone that we keep locked away. That side of us that holds all of our embarrassing things. I've never been able to truly sympathize with an alcoholic and I didn't know if the fact that she was one would frustrate me to no end while reading. It did, but in a good way. I cannot tell you how many times I sincerely hoped she was sobering up for good and then when she would slip, my heart would ache for her. I felt a lot like her flat mate, Cathy. Rachel's blackouts, which are SO interesting on a psychological level, truly made this story and made Rachel one of the best characters I've read in a while. Anna - Four words for you homegirl: Chill. The. Heck. Out. I mean, I get it, I do, but chill. Just chill. You don't own your town. You can't call the police every time Rachel shows up. In this, I'm grateful for Tom. I'm glad he talked her out of it so many time. (view spoiler)[ actually, in hindsight, knowing that she lived with Tom really explains her crazy paranoia with Rachel. He probably used that paranoia against Anna and most likely heightened it. Ugh. Tom.  (hide spoiler)]Megan/Jess - Poor girl. My heart broke for her so many times. I can imagine how I would be even close sane after expediting what she did. She was another character that was interesting to read about. She seemed crazy and unstable like the other two women and then you find out the root and it explains so much. Then her odd behaviors make complete sense. You understand why she is restless and needs constant love and emotional attention. Poor, poo girl. (view spoiler)[ Tom - I kind of saw this coming. I was highly suspicious of him about half way through the book because, Komal was too obvious, as was Rachel and Scott, and I though maybe Anna was in on it, but I had to be Tom. He was the only one that it could have been where you weren't thrown for a complete loop. He was shady to me. Like hella shady. And now knowing how messed up he is, I wish we had more background. Like why he is that way, just like we got each of the women's background as to why they were ""crazy"". Also, as a thought, did he even go to work everyday? I mean, was he the boy on the train? We find out he lied about everything and then we have him coming home from work whenever he pleases and a huge debt owed to his parents. I doubt he did what he really did for work. Actually, I just doubt everything that he does and everything that comes out of his mouth. I'm glad Anna and Rachel were able to see his end together. I think it's the only way either of them would have been able to cope and move one with life.  (hide spoiler)]Overall it was a great book and I can't wait to read more from Paula!"
728,Leslie,WOW. ignored my finals to finish this. amazing. 
729,Gwendolyn,My kind of book. Couldn't put it down. Loved it!
730,Amber Gregg,"“I have never understood how people can blithely disregard the damage they do by following their hearts.” The Girl on The Train follows the perspective of three females that are initially only loosely connected. Rachel, an extreme alcoholic, takes the train every day and begins to feel like she personally knows a married couple that she sees as she passes every evening. When that wife, Megan, goes missing, Rachel feels the need to step in and figure out the case herself.Many people have compared this book to Gone Girl, which is one of my favorite books, and now The Girl on The Train has also won my Best Book Award. But I like these books for different reasons. In general, I would say that if you liked Gone Girl, you would probably like this book and vice versa. However, if you didn’t like Gone Girl, don’t completely discredit this one. While they are both thrillers with dysfunctional female leads, The Girl on The Train is much faster paced and not as horrifyingly disturbing as Gone Girl. Many people (including me) hate books where the lead character is unlikeable, but The Girl on The Train is one of those books where you don’t really need to like the main characters. Actually, you will probably hate most of them throughout the whole book. However, by the end I actually felt some sympathy for all but one of the characters—if you’ve read the book you know who I am talking about, but I won’t spoil it here.

731,Harry Brake,"Take the movie and novel Gone Girl, add a little fatal Attraction, and you have a chair-gripping version of Paula Hawkins FIRST debut novel. Let me repeat. DEBUT, as in FIRST novel. I whipped through all of this EASILY in two days and you have to wonder, if this is her FIRST novel, HOW will she EVER match this one in subsequent writings?Seen on Barnes & Noble bookshelves in the states everywhere rated in GoodReads as one of the top novel as well as in Booklist, I am SO glad I have this in our Upper School Library - I can't even begin to tell you how many times you will be shocked from the page turning plot Hawkins infuses - this is an all star find of the year :) You'll see..."
732,Jay,"Ok, I guess there are two camps when it comes to this book , HATE IT!!! and OH it was REALLY GOOD. Me? I liked it. I will pause for flying tomatoes ... Ok, now that half of you said WHAT out loud , that is why I like no, love this book. First book in a long time I would talk back to the characters in the book. I pulled for Rachel and wanted to stop drinking. I would cringe every time she would get black out drunk and wake up the next day and say ""Something bad happened."" This was a book about a woman , who is a real alcoholic , trying to figure out what happened last night when she was black out drunk , did I mention she woke up with bruised and battered and with a deep feeling ""Something bad happened"" . Oh, did I mention that a woman when missing in the same area and same time Rachel's last coherent memory of that night. Yes, I loved this book. "
733,Charleen,"There is someting about this book. You start it and when you look up again you are already half-way through and think 'How did this happen?' I am not particulary fond of thriller and crime novels, but it just gripped me, right from the first page. It is chilling and exciting. You don't like the characters much, but sooner or later you get their motives. You start to understand, that you are not supposed to like them, you are supposed to feel with them. The Girl on the Train is a perfect book to read during a summer heat wave, it will chill you to the bones. Great debut!"
734,Jaw,"AwesomeCouldn't put this book down! Very similar to Gone Girl. Apparently, this is the author's first book. Fantastic! Quick read!"
735,Diana Long,"This novel is well written, highly imaginative with twists and turns pulling the reader into a web of suspense. It doesn't get much better than this. The characters are not the sort you tend to feel any sort of compassion for, they are not likable and extremely faulty. The main protagonist of the story would be Rachel, a self destructive alcoholic followed by the mistress Anna who displaces Rachel (takes her husband for her own, her home...her life) and the neighbor Megan who has mega issues of her own, chiefly fidelity. The author writes the work going from the thoughts and actions of these three women as a first person narrative. I found a similar way of writing in “Gone Girl” by Gilllian Flynn, where the author moves back and forth like a she said, he said story. This involved into a three way thought process. The whole story flows and it's difficult to not want to know “what comes next?” "
736,Jas,"Who really know's anyone, really? If there was a underlying theme, I think this would be it. I found the book quite similar to Rachel Abbott's novel; Stranger Child in style and context. I can see the similarities with Gone Girl (Gillian Flynn) in the complexity of characters and storyline. I read The Girl on the Train, on the train and could imagine the scene so perfectly,the characters on the train and in street, as well as houses backing on to the train line. I loved this book, could not put it down from around 60% through, I read through to the end in the early hours."
737,Jan,"Een pageturner om U tegen te zeggen. Meeslepend, moeilijk weg te leggen."
738,Wolverinefactor,"Gone Girl didn't grab me like I thought it would and I got an advance readers copy of this from work and probably wouldn't have read it except the word of mouth was insane. That was some ride! I read about 100 pages before bed last night, woke up at 4am and devoured the last 120. Time didn't matter, I was so engrossed by the characters and the plot. Been a long time since I've been this hooked on a book. "
739,Britany,I loved this book! Little slow at first but got totally awesome. Kept me on the edge of my seat page turner and I loved all the characters.
740,Rachel Friars,"I'm thinking 4.5, what a rollercoaster :)"
741,Hala Salameh,4.5
742,Rachel Pierce,One of my favorite thriller books I've ever read! Did not disappoint!
743,Edyta,"Let me start by saying that I chose to go with an audiobook for this one. That being said, the narrators' performances were an enjoyable experience. It really brought the book to life. I think if I had done the ebook or paperback, I would still have liked the book but it may have dragged in a few places.  The story was simple, but written well enough to keep me intrigued. Everyone was a suspect in my book. I enjoyed the triple female POV. People can be so pathetic, twisted and selfish and all of it is showcased in this book. "
744,Karen Bartlett,"Well, I put off reading this one for a while - heard good and bad about it, and there were comparisons with ""Gone Girl"" (not all good) so I started it with some trepidation, and honestly, I couldn't have been more wrong! This is by far one of the most enjoyable and enthralling reads I have had in ages!Rachel catches the same train each morning, and again each night. She knows all the stops and as she rattles along the tracks each day becomes a voyeur into the lives of those whose houses back onto the train tracks, including the people who now live in the home she once called her own - her ex-husband and his new wife and child. She makes up names and creates a fantasy life for a young couple she frequently sees in their garden, and envies the perfect life they seem to have. But one day she sees something that shatters that fantasy, and she becomes entwined in the lives of these strangers, and her ex-husband - drawing them all together in ways that no-one could have seen coming.Some critics have said this story is predictable - I must be getting a little jaded in my reading, because I actually didn't see some of the twists in this story until they were upon me. The pace was fantastic (definitely an express train!), and I really liked the characters - so many examples of ""all is not as it seems"" here.Buy yourself a ticket, get on board and enjoy the ride!!!"
745,thewanderingjew,"If you like a good mystery, this is the book for you. This story will have you sitting on the edge of your seat, turning pages frantically until you get to the end. It was almost impossible to put down or to guess the outcome. The novel is written in the format of a journal or a diary, although the timeline is not a straight line. All of the main characters are introduced quickly into the narrative, and each slowly reveals personality traits.When it begins, it is 2013, and Rachel Watson is riding on a train to London. She spies some clothes at the edge of the tracks and her mind begins to wander as she imagines whose they might be and how they might have gotten there. Rachel is unable to accept her divorce from her husband Tom, although a couple of years have passed. She has gained weight, drinks to excess and is obsessed with her ex-husband’s new life. As she rides, she reminisces about her marriage. She was a different, happier person once, very different until she discovered Tom’s affair with Anna, until he left her. Anna became involved with Tom, even though she knew he was married. Tom and Anna have a young daughter and seem very happy. Rachel cannot accept this. From the train she can see her former home, but she avoids looking there, instead, she concentrates on a home a few doors away and watches a happy couple there that she has named Jess and Jason. In real life they are Scott and Megan Hipwell, but Rachel doesn’t know this. As she rides the train, daily, she looks for them and creates a fantasy about their lives. He is the perfect husband, idolizing Jess as he chats with her outside, and she is an adoring, loving wife. Megan Hipwell seems very happy when she is viewed from the train, but secretly her life is coming unglued. Both Rachel and Megan have lost someone they love, both have trouble sleeping, both have lost their jobs. Megan had an art gallery that closed. Rachel lost her job because she drinks too much, becomes rude and argumentative and also blacks out and remembers little of what she does when she is drunk. Rachel is ashamed of her degenerate behavior, but Megan kind of likes to walk on the wild side, to live a bit dangerously, to test the water. Both of the women have secrets in their past or present lives, and both of the women want to travel, although one dreamt of traveling with her brother, and the other had dreamt of traveling with her husband to recapture their spark. Both want to improve the life they are living. The lives of the three women intersect as we discover that Anna, Rachel and Megan are connected. Anna, who was “the other woman”, is afraid of Rachel and wants her to stop calling the house to harass them. Megan (Rachel’s Jess), briefly takes a job as Anna’s nanny. Rachel remains in love with Tom, and one night she returns to the neighborhood, gets drunk and blacks out. When she wakes up bruised and bleeding, sick to her stomach at home, she remembers little of how she spent the night or how she was injured. When she discovers that the woman Jess/Megan goes missing that same night, and does not return, she becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to her, of unlocking her lost memories. One day, on the train, Rachel notices that someone has written on the side of a building, “Life is not a paragraph”. She responds to that statement with her own, “death is not a parenthesis”. That short thought bubble stayed with me throughout the book as the mystery evolved. Death is not a part of the whole. Death is not an interlude or an afterthought. Life has a beginning and an end, and death is the end result, the final outcome.The lives of Megan and Rachel do not run concurrently. Megan’s begins a couple of years in the past, moving into the present, and eventually, each story line, Anna, Megan and Rachel’s meet, bringing the book to a satisfying, but surprising conclusion. "
746,Orlanda Machado,"Original Blog Review: https://myescapebookscoffeetea.wordpr...My Blog: http://myescapebookscoffeetea.wordpre... My Instagram: http://instagram.com/blog.myescape/Buy the same edition I got on BookDepository: http://www.bookdepository.com/Girl-on...BookDepository Affiliate Link: http://www.bookdepository.com/?a_aid=... Actual Rating: 4.5 StarsOk, I really am speechless.When I started reading this book I was so, but so confused that you really can’t even imagine. When I bought it I wanted to like this book because everyone in this world loves this book… everyone says awesome things about it… so why not? I wanted it, I saw it and I bought it.Since I was/kind of still am in a reading slump and I didn’t know what to read because I was not in the mood to read anything I picked it up just to see if it was that good… as good as everyone says it is… and OH BOY, yes, it is awesome.As I mentioned before yes, I was confused at the beginning and I was confused during most part of the book and I think that I am still confused with some stuff, but some things started making sense. There were a lot of characters… there were Megan, Jess, Scott, Tom, Anna, Rachel… and I was like “WHAT?”… and then I just started thinking and I discovered that some characters didn’t exist, some characters were just one character with two different names… yes I am not making sense because I don’t really want to spoil everything for you! So if you want to know what the hell I’m talking about go ahead and read the book…I think that the most important thing to read this book is to have some patience… and to pay attention while you are reading it… because there are some things that you can actually discover at the beginning of the book if you are paying that attention that I was talking about… and those same things that you can discover by yourself are only explained at the end of the book… so you can save some years of your life if you are paying attention, believe me… because otherwise you are going to get really nervous and you are going to feel like you are getting mad sometimes because you can’t figure out what’s really happening and your heart will start racing and you will seriously lose at least 5 years of your own life… (kind of, I am just being kind of dramatic).Now for real… this book was amazing, but I have to tell you… at the beginning it was quite hard to stay tuned… I’m being honest with you when I say that I wanted to give up… I was thinking that I couldn’t like this book because it was boring… I thought that I was going to be the only person in this world not liking this story… but I was pretty wrong… I finished the book and I just loved it… it was really good, you just have to be patient and to try to understand what the author is trying to show you… once you get into the story, once you understand what’s happening you can’t put the book down."
747,Ian Brydon,"Some books are very easy to review, and this is one of them. 'The Girl on The Train' is simply excellent. Immediately engaging and gripping, with a carefully constructed plot and readily believable (and even recognisable) characters. I had actually been a little reluctant to read this book following the immense hype that has surrounded its huge success on both sides of the Atlantic, and because a lot of people had compared it to Gillian Flynn's 'Gone Girl', which I had not liked at all. In the end, I relented simply because I was on holiday and saw it on offer at a very cheap price and decided to give it a go. That was certainly a fortuitous decision.The book takes the form of alternating narratives from Rachel, an alcoholic divorcee who regularly commutes from Hertfordshire into London on a route that passes the house where she previously li9ved with her ex-husband. She becomes intrigued by the house just four along from her old home, which she comes to observe on a regular basis as her train is invariably brought to a halt at the foot of its garden. Seeing the occupants (who had arrived since she lived in that street) she starts to imagine their life, even assigning them names and speculating about their respective jobs. Rachel is not a happy person, and as her narrative proceeds we gain an alarming insight into her lifestyle which is not as it initially seems.Interspersed with Rachel's story we are offered Megan's narrative, which starts about a year earlier than Rachel's. Megan lives in the house that Rachel observes almost every day, but the story that she unwinds reveals a very different life from that which Rachel had imagined for her.The portrayal of a personality unwinding, and the events that unfold as a consequence is fascinating. Hawkins combines very sharp observation with immense suspense, producing a heady and addictive brew. Having started the book I found it very difficult to put it down."
748,Phrynne,"Well I am giving that five stars because I though it was original, exciting and very very readable. I thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience including the unpleasant but quite real characters, the clever story line involving the trains and the final twist regarding who the murderer actually was. I did guess that in advance but knowing did not in any way spoil the last chapter. I loved the parts where the girl is looking out of the train and making up stories about the people she sees. I ' m sure lots of us peer out into people's windows and back yards when we are travelling by train. I know I do! Any way I enjoyed this book much more than the blurb led me to believe I would and that made me very happy:)"
749,Sean Smart,"An amazing thriller, couldn't put it down. "
750,Kate Saunders,Listened to this book on Audible. Couldn't stop listening. Finished it in two days walking around everywhere with headphones. 
751,Grace,"Wow okay this book. As you can see I gave it 5 stars so it was a good one. I don't know if thats because it was so brutal that I was so shocked and had to kept reading to find out or because I liked the writing.""What on earth's wrong with you? Are you drunk?"" he asks, but I can see in his eyes that he knows I'm sober and I'm betting that for once he wishes I wasn't.""Thats some good writing.The story starts out in the first-person perspective of Rachel; a reckless, depressed, newly divorced, drunk who rides the train everyday to portray to her roommate that she still has a job, that she got fired for, for being too drunk.Then the story switches to Megans perspective. A depressed, reckless, run-a-wayer kinda girl from all her problems. Seem familiar? Megan lost her brother in a motorcycle accident and is still grieving. So she hooks up with men to try and make her feel wanted; good. And just like Megan all of these characters in this book are whack. They all have profoundly messy lives and are just trying to figure it all out. Rachel rides the train everyday to get away from her life and looks at this one perfect-looking house in particular and starts to make up a story about the couple that lives in that perfect-looking lifestyle. And reflects it on her own marriage before the divorce. You learn that the people that living in that perfect house are none other then Megan and Scott. So when Megan goes missing Rachel sees her in the papers as an opportunity and decides she can do something that might be useful in her life and find out what happened to Megan. Did Megan run away, or was she kidnapped? What about the man that Rachel saw kissing Megan one morning? Megan's sections then become flash backs in time to before she disappeared. Slowly learning about Rachel and Megan and why she finds warmth in being with so many men. The Girl on the Train is a must read(to kids over 16..) Its super creepy.5/5 10/10Would read again."
752,RJ,"I was not prepared. This book is dark and controlling, and I could not stop until it was done. It does have shades of Gone Girl but a somewhat more satisfying ending. I'm already casting the characters in my head.Damn. That was a trip."
753,Bryana Braxton,"Cheating husbands, dead wives, drunks, and so much more drama!At first, I didn't understand the hype around this book. I didn't like it. The beginning is really sad. The characters are all very flawed, marred by their own vices. But getting towards the end, the plot suddenly twists and everything you expected to happen doesn't. You thought you knew the characters but then you learn the truth. No one is who you think they are. You're just as surprised as the characters. The author straps you into a rollercoaster of a dramatic triumphant ending. Wow! What an exciting read!"
754,Emily ,"HOLY S**T ! This book is so so so good! It has me wanting to read more and it wasn't predictable! Which was great because I don't like books were you can tell the ending! The only thing I didn't like was that it was a little bit confusing but other than that, it was a absolutely AMAZING!"
755,Janna Wong,"When I first began this book, it frustrated me: the three lead characters were: an alcoholic, a depressed and unhappy woman and an embittered new mother. How would I ever get through it when the protagonists were unsympathetic and annoying? I am so glad I persisted because the book is a thrilling read and so worth the investment of time and energy.Anyone who has commuted to work will understand Anna's situation: as she takes the train to and from work every day, she looks out the window and imagines the lives of those who live in the homes along the route. But, when this situation is combined with Anna's alcoholism and her inability to maintain control of her life, her memories and her stories, you can see just how scary it can be when a real, honest-to-goodness crime occurs on her train route.After I got over my initial annoyance with the three characters, I was riveted by the story and by the author's creative ability to keep the mystery fresh and have it unfold slowly, not revealing the culprit until the end.Excellent read!"
756,Sharon Herron,This novel kept me in limbo all the way to the end. The author is exceptionally talented at setting up the characters and plot. I loved the Hitchcockian style of writing---twists and turns were unexpected. I hope this author is working on her next thriller.
757,Yue Dong,My two dear friends recommended me this book and said I would like it since it is similar to the gone girl. Then it turns out I really love it! I am crazy about it! It is the first English novel I have ever finished! I couldn't stop reading it even English is not my first language. I always stayed up the whole night last night to finish the book. The ending is so unexpected and surprising to me. I love stories that I can't guess the end:)
758,Jaynie,One of the best books I've read in a while-finished it in 2 days because I couldn't put it down!
759,Liane Almeida,"just loved it, it´s the kind of thriller where you can´t put the book down."
760,Kaitlin,Fun book that kept me staying up late just to read another chapter
761,Nadine Jones,"Wow. Just wow. On the one hand, I don't want to give this too good of a review, because I don't want to make others' expectations too high. That might ruin it. This book need to sneak inside and wow you when you don't expect it. On the other hand, this was exquisite.It's a bit like a roller coaster: steady yet fun at the start, the tension builds slowly but surely thought the first half - you're intrigued, not quite certain if this is going to be amazing or just fun, and it's okay if you need to set the book down now and then. The tension crests at the midway point, and there is no setting this book down, it is a breathless ride to the end.The story is told from three points of view: Rachel, Anna, and Megan. If I have one quibble with this book, it's that the three voices are not sufficiently distinct - there were a few times she I would lose sight of who was speaking, and I'd get ""you"" and ""I"" confused, and have to go back and check. That said, I definitely identified best with Rachel. She is the one I think of as the main character, the one who has the most depth, the one I understood the best. Rachel is fucked up, but I could easily see myself slipping into the mess she's in.Through the first half, I found myself comparing this to other recent thrillers: Before I Go To Sleep and Gone Girl. This story is the one that might be told if the main character of Before I Go to Sleep was investigating the disappearance in Gone Girl, but both of those books were a bit too over the top to feel real. A mistake this book does not make.Hawkins' writing is exquisite in its spareness. The character's musings appeal to my Inner Bitch.
Beautiful sunshine, cloudless skies, no one to play with, nothing to do. Living like this, the way I'm living at the moment, is harder in the summer when there is so much daylight, so little cover of darkness, when everyone is out and about, being flagrantly, aggressively happy. It's exhausting, and it makes you feel bad if you're not joining in.*She must be very secure in herself, I suppose, in them, for it not to bother her, to walk where another woman has walked before. She obviously doesn't think of me as a threat. I think about Ted Hughes, moving Assia Wevill into the home he'd shared with Plath, of her wearing Sylvias' clothes, brushing her hair with the same brush. I want to ring Anna up and remind her that Assia ended up with her head in the oven, just like Sylvia did.*Cathy is waiting for me when I get home. She's standing in the kitchen, aggressively drinking a glass of water.

That simple image, of ""aggressively"" drinking a glass of water ... it communicates so much in so few words: Cathy, normally ridiculously nice and accommodating, is angry, justifiably angry, she's stewing, she's simmering with all the things she wants to say, but she is also passive aggressive in her anger, she withholds the words and lets it out in small gestures. I would never think to describe it that way, but it is perfect.Things I liked:1. The characters are complex, with both good and bad qualities (except for the villain, in the end).2. I did not guess who the villain was.3. I LOVE the Unreliable Narrator trope, it makes the puzzle that much more fun to solve."
762,Ann M. Noser,"FREAKING LOVED THIS!This book was the Best birthday present ever!Couldn't stop reading it, didn't see the ending coming.And, best of all, now I want to go back and read it all over again--dissecting every chapter for the clues."
763,Marlene,"Like Rachel, I dream up lives of the inhabitants of houses I pass when traveling. Unlike Rachel, I never intend on getting mixed up in the realities of those neighbourhoods.Way better than ""Gone Girl"", I actually felt empathy towards the women(especially Rachel and Anna)in this psychological thriller. I didn't feel anything positive towards Nick and Amy in ""Gone Girl"" and nearly closed the book part way through. At least all of main characters got what they deserved in both books.In the upcoming film version, it will be interesting to see if the director can repeat the story's tension and how Emily Blunt fares as Rachel. Hopefully I won't be disappointed."
764,Betsy Ross,"This gripping thriller will keep you up all night. It's no surprise that it has been compared to Gone Girl, because just like Gillian Flynn's riveting mystery, the characters are well-developed and the plot is filled with endless twists. Just when you feel that you get to know the characters, they shock you with secrets from their past or bold, unexpected actions.Rachel is a depressingly hopeless alcoholic, riding the train to London daily to avoid telling her roommate that she got fired from her job. From her seat on the train she observes the people in the houses she passes. One particular couple, whom she names ""Jess and Jason,"" appear so happy and makes Rachel long for the life she once had when she was happily married to Tom and beginning to plan a family. Rachel: ""They're a match, they're a set. They're happy, I can tell. They're what I used to be.""Rachel's fantasy of ""Jess and Jason"" (really Megan and Scott) could not be further from the truth, as both have secrets to hide and a depressing relationship. Megan: ""I can't do this. I can't just be a wife. I don't understand how anyone does it - there is literally nothing to do but wait. Wait for a man to come home and love you. Either that or look around for something to distract you."" Rachel discovers a secret about her imagined ""Jess"" shortly before Megan disappears. While Rachel feels betrayed by a person she thought she knew (but never actually met), she finds a new purpose in her life and dedicates her existence to solving the mystery of Megan's disappearance. Rachel: ""I am no longer just a girl on the train, going back and forth without point or purpose."" She becomes deeply tangled in a mess of deceit and lies, and realizes quickly that no one can be trusted.All the characters are so tainted by their flaws, and yet they are so honest and depressingly real that you can't help but relate to them. This story goes to show that even the seemingly happiest people have their secrets and baggage. Rachel can't stop drinking herself into a blackout stupor, while longing to get back together with her abusive ex and become a mother, believing that this would make her worthwhile. Meanwhile, Megan was unhappy in her marriage, seeking comfort elsewhere, and happened to cross paths with Anna, the new wife of Rachel's ex-husband. Everyone is mysteriously connected, and it turns out that Rachel is actually the good one, the one who loves unconditionally, forgives the faults of others, and recognizes the dangers of following one's heart. "
765,Vishaya87,"Jedna z lepszych książek, jakie czytałam od dłuższego czasu. Decydując się na lekturę tej powieści, zasugerowałam się rekomendacją mojego mistrza, Stephena Kinga. King po raz kolejny mnie nie zawiódł - Paula Hawkins stworzyła ciekawy, zaskakujący a jednocześnie - czasami nawet okrutnie - realistyczny świat, który wciąga od samego początku. Rachel jest kobietą upadłą - posypało się jej małżeństwo, praca, topiła smutki w coraz większej ilości alkoholu. W pewnej chwili okazuje się, że czyjaś tragedia jest dla niej odrodzeniem. Rachel wychodzi wreszcie z wielomiesięcznej depresji i marazmu, odkrywa że alkohol nie jest panaceum na przygnębienie. Lekiem tym jest aktywność. Główna bohaterka okazuje się dzielną, nieustraszoną kobietą, która mimo upokorzeń walczy o prawdę. Choć zakończenie ""Dziewczyny z pociągu"" trudno nazwać happy end'em to jednak niesie ze sobą nadzieję i refleksję, że można wyjść z każdego życiowego impasu. Wystarczy tylko bardzo mocno chcieć. "
766,Ashley Hebert,"So stinkin good! I haven't read a book this fast since ""Gone Girl"". If you love suspense and a page turner, you must read!"
767,Aileen,"La verdad es que este libro fue todo lo que prometieron, rápido de leer, buena escritura, buena trama, un gran giro en la historia (que no vi venir) y más.Creo que el un gran thriller psicológico que realmente cumple con la definición de ""no puedes confiar en nadie"".El único pero que tengo con este libro, pero que no es algo malo, es que todos los principales me producían cierto rechazo, ya sea por sus personalidades, sus acciones o motivaciones, pero eso hace que el libro sea diferente y refrescante. Debo aclarar que no he leído Gone girl, por lo que no tengo punto de comparación con otro libro de este estilo.100% recomendado. "
768,MyACPL Athens County Public Libraries,"from Erin:I don’t generally read ""The Book Everyone is Talking About,"" but for some reason The Girl on the Train appealed to me. The story begins on a regular Friday with a regular commuter on her daily trip to the office. Rachel is an unhappy alcoholic, recently divorced, who still pines after her ex-husband and is consumed with jealousy for his new wife and baby. Every day she sees a house and a couple from the train, and has invented a happy back story for them that she clearly wishes for herself. Inevitably, things are much messier than they seem on the surface, for Rachel, the couple, her ex-husband and his wife, and just about everyone in the book. This book reminded me of Gone Girl in some respects, in that a woman’s disappearance is at the heart of the story, many of the characters are awful people, and everyone’s life is a wreck. But the central mystery is so engaging that you want to keep reading. If it tells you anything, I read the entire book in one sitting. Get on the list now because it’s really long!"
769,Alecxia,Mind blowing. 
770,Isobel Pratt,"Full review will be up asap, for now tho... i loved it!"
771,Oocha,"Holy cow!!! I enjoyed this book immensely. It was intense and gripping, and very well written. I would not compare it to Gone Girl, which is how it's described in a lot of reviews. It was soooo much better. While it does have an unreliable narrator, she's unreliable in a different way. Highly recommend!(I listened to this book twice in 2015- Feb, July)"
772,Tamara Rodriguez,The beginning was a bit dry but a phenomenal ending!
773,Beth 'Misselthwaite',"Ok. Wow. Looks like it is the year if the thriller for me where favourite stories are concerned. Triad, Before I Go To Sleep and now this.After an admittedly shaky start for me that left me dubious about the potential rest of the novel with the initially jarring switches between characters and dates, at some point I seemed to find the 'signal place' and from then on was swept up in the speed of one desperate to see the story through to its conclusion. I even lost track of time towards the end, reading in huge chunks that felt like no time at all lost in the thrills, red herrings and suspense. I can count on one hand the number of novels that have had me in that situation in the past year so far, but this has proven a wonderful addition to that list.Suffice to say, I can certainly see why this book has remained in it's chartered positions and garnered such public interest. My instinct told me when I first found this book when it was initially published that it would become something big. For once I was right, and for once I agree. I guess all I can add now is that I hope the supposed film adaptation anticipated about this can/will live up to the transfixing nature of the novel. Kudos Ms Hawkins, the best debut thriller I have enjoyed in a while."
774,Heather Catlin,excellent book!
775,Lauren Stoolfire,"Rachel rides the same commuter train every day on her way to and from work in London. While the train stops at a signal as it's going behind a row of suburban homes, she's able to watch a young married couple have breakfast on their deck. She doesn't really know them, but just by watching them every day she feels like she does. She's even made up names for them (Jess and Jason) and life stories, just based around what she sees of them for a few seconds every morning, but they seem like a perfect couple. But then one morning, she sees something shocking, something that urges her to go to the police. After she tells them what she knows, she becomes inextricably entangled in the ""perfect"" couple's life whether she wants to be or not. And, Rachel's involvement just might cause more harm than good.I could not put The Girl on the Train down. I found myself really invested in the mystery surrounding both Rachel and ""Jess"". I love a good psychological thriller and this is no exception. Hawkins characters and plot are complex, require focus, and are bound to pull you in. Usually I have problems making it through books where the main character isn't likable and let's just say Rachel is someone you wouldn't want to be friends with, or acquaintances with, at all. For that matter, none of the characters are all that likable. But, in the case of this novel, I was so wrapped up in solving the mystery and piecing our unreliable narrator's story together that I developed a love/hate relationship with the character.If you like Alfred Hitchcock films, Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn, and unreliable narrators, you might love The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins. I expect this addicting novel will be one of my favorites of 2015 and I'm interested in anything Hawkins has coming up!Seriously, just go read the book already!"
776,Mariah,Really good suspense novel. Kept me on edge and guessing the whole book. I like the writing and it has good flow. 
777,Dr. Lloyd E. Campbell,"The Girl on the Train is an entertaining book. The five main characters in the book are well drawn. The nagging question that haunts me about the book is, ""What is the meaning of the train?"" The train acts as a sixth main character in the story. For me it read like an Agatha Christie Whodunit. The author wove together the three female characters' narratives like an impressionistic painting. This book is well worth reading "
778,LeeAnne,"THE GIRL ON THE TRAINThis psychological thriller is being labeled this year's ""Gone Girl"" but I think it's better. It's fast paced and addictive. The twists and turns kept me guessing all over the place, until the very end.Dreamworks has already snatched up the movie rights! THE GIRL ON THE TRAINFasten your seatbelts. It's going to be a bumpy night.Rachel is divorced, unemployed and considers herself worthless. She believes women are valued for 2 things: their looks and their roles as mothers. Rachel is barren and she considers herself too plain looking. She also drinks too much, to the point of regular blackouts. The next day she can’t remember where she went, what she said, what she did, etc... She's a hot mess, but you can't help but feel sympathy for her. Rachel rides the commuter train twice a day, pretending to go to work, so her landlady will not evict her. Every day her train slows and stops near the Victorian row home she used to share with her ex-husband, Tom, who now lives there with his gorgeous wife Anna and their new baby. To distract herself from obsessing over her ex, Rachel turns her focus to another couple who live two doors down. She refers to them as the “golden couple,” she gives them names and fantasizes about their perfect life together.  A voyeristic photo by Gail AlbertOne day Megan, the female half of the 'golden couple', goes missing and her case becomes headline news. That same night, a few doors down, Rachel was reported to the police for harassing and stalking her ex-husband and his new wife, Anna. Anna and Megan bear such a striking resemblance to one another, the police suspect a case of mistaken identity and foul play involving Rachel as the perpetrator. Rachel was so drunk that night, she can't remember a thing, but she has a sinking feeling she did something really awful. You ride along as Rachel tries to piece together what really happened that night.  (photo by Gail Albert) A lot of readers are comparing this book to Hitchcock's ""Rear Window,"" because of the mysterious and voyeuristic way Rachel observes unsuspecting people through the windows of their homes. I agree! I can't wait to see how they visually translate this book to film. If you are in the mood for a great psychological thriller, don't miss this one!"
779,Laura Wiliams,LOVED this book. Couldn't stop reading it. So well-written and suspenseful!
780,Andreea Păunescu,Loved it!!
781,Caroline Mitchell,"I enjoyed this very original story which I downloaded on audio book for my morning commute to work. There was something very surreal about listening to The Girl on the Train as I travelled to work, allowing my own train journey to draw me into the lives of Rachael, Megan and Anna. Rachel’s character was written in great depth, so much so I found myself liking her despite all her self imposed problems and insecurities.I got through this book very quickly and it kept me captivated throughout. The only thing I will say is that this is not my normal genre and I usually read fast paced crime thrillers or Stephen King novels. I’m not sure this book would have kept my attention as well if I had bought it in paperback form, and it was partly due to the fantastic narration that it kept me listening into the wee hours. I would recommend to anyone wavering between audiobook and paperback to go for the audio version. The plot was good, I guessed the ending three quarter ways through but this is not your classic whodunnit, to me it’s all about the characters and how their relationships interact, develop and change as their worlds collide. There was a lot of hype surrounding this book and it is very well deserved. It’s very cleverly written and I look forward to reading more from this author in the future."
782,Rachel Wallace,"5 StarsGreat read!! I rarely give 5 Stars but this book totally deserves it. I loved the plot; a very sad, lonely, drunk, yet sympathetic woman cannot seem to let her ex husband go and move on with her life. She certainly has reason to be angry with him, he dumped her for another woman, but 2 years later she is still obsessed to the point of losing everyone and everything in her life. At times you really feel for her but other times you just want to shake her and tell her to get over it. One drunken night, while she (Rachel), acts on an impulse and decides to show up at her ex husband's house, she finds herself in the middle out of a missing persons investigation. The story is told alternately between the points of view of Rachel, Anna (former mistress, current wife of Rachel's ex) and Megan (missing women). As the plot unfolds, we find out more about each woman, their lives, histories and motives. We also realize how little people really know about others and how outside impressions can be very deceiving. While reading this book, I didn't really find myself reflecting on the writing style. To me, that means it was written seamlessly for the story. The book was easy to get hooked on, I couldn't put it down once I got started. The ending was not what I had expected. Although the 'bad guy' was one of several on my list, I really didn't figure it out until very near the end. I highly recommend reading this book. I'd love to hear others thoughts on it. It would make a great book club read. "
783,Caroline," I loved The Girl on the Train. It's much more than a who-done-it, although it is a fabulous one. Rachel, the main character and narrator, takes the same train into and out of London every day. A couple, who she soon nicknames Jason and Jess, catch her attention, and she enjoys seeing what they do every day when they have breakfast and an early evening drink on their terrace. They seem to have the ideal happily married life. She becomes fiercely protective of them even though she has never met them. One day she sees that something seems to have gone terribly wrong with Jess, and she decides it is her job to warn Jason. Only before she gets up the guts to warn Jason, whose real name is Scott, Jess, whose real name is Megdan, turns up murdered, and her face is plastered across the newspapers' front pages . Rachel, named by a main character as a sad, no-life alcoholic, inserts herself into the police investigation, in part because she has some personal business of her own down the street from the couple's home. However, she also has seen something in a drunken stupor that she senses is key to the police investigation--only she can't remember what. Although Rachel's obsessiveness with the murder and her alcoholism should have been toned down, the depiction of her poor self-esteem is right on target. Reading her detailed thought process and her interaction with the other characters shows excellent writing. The plot twists and turns many times, and each time I had to put down the book, I was excited to get back to it. I knew what the end was gonna be (who-done-it) about 100 pages beforehand, but I still loved getting there. Yes, about 50-100 pages could have been easily deleted, but it still was great. I mean, one doesn't dislike ""Gone with the Wind"" because the movie is four hours long. Right??"
784,Deborah,"I was really on the fence about whether to give this book 4 or 5 stars. In the end I opted for 5, because I enjoyed it as much as most of the (relatively few) books that I've rated 5 stars. But please, Paula Hawkins: learn what a semicolon is for, and use them as needed."
785,Margherita Auditore,"Non riuscivo a smettere di leggerlo e l'ho finito in una giornata.La storia vista da tre donne, ognuna diversa dall'altra.L'investigazione è assolutamente assente. è tutto solo nella testa della protagonista. è lei che pensa, che riflette, che cerca di ricordare, che va in giro per la città a racimolare indizi, che cerca di capire che cosa sia successo..E anche se verso la fine capisci cosa è successo veramente ancora prima che lo racconti lei, è proprio questo il bello: che tu conosci la verità ancora prima che la protagonista lo ammetta a se stessa, ed è come se le dicessi ""stai attenta! non andare lì! no, non farlo!"" "
786,Jennifer Struss,"This is a page-turningly, sleep-losingly suspenseful story. It reminded me a little of ""Gone Girl"" with shrewd use of the unlikable and unreliable narrator. Great read for mystery lovers."
787,Farnoosh Brock,"I'm new to psychological thrillers, and thrilled (ha ha, no pun) to have read this book as my first foray into the genre. I listened to the book on Audible and enjoyed every second. I am going to dissect why that is, because I didn't like any of the characters in this book and that's interesting, don't you think?Why would a book captivate our attention when we dislike everyone in the story? I haven't read Gone Girl (yet) but I do agree with one of the Goodreads reviewers in that none of the characters in this book were likable to me. What I loved was the powerful slowly-unfolding story-telling, the gripping, captivating way the author carries you along, leaving you absolutely no choice but to go with her. You simply have to know where this leads, what happens, and in the process, you are willing to put up with the unlikable Anna, the selfish, self-centered Megan, and the drunk, over-apologetic, and yes, at times, pathetic Rachael and the nervous anxious and overly concerned Tom. Okay perhaps I liked Kamal, the shrink. Yes, he was the least unlikable and the more sentimental character, and most of the time, he was doing the right thing.Anyway, this to me says that curiosity is a stronger driver for knowledge than emotional attachment. Either way, I devoured this book in one week, I listened carefully and enjoyed the three narrative voices so much that I couldn't bring myself to speed up the audio to even 1.25x even though I was dying to move forward on the story.""Girl on the Train"" was satisfying from start to finish and here are the things that Paula Hawkins did extremely well:- Chilling start. One for sorrow, two for joy, three for a girl. A nursery rhyme that is running through Megan's mind.- Three points of view. We have Anna, Rachael, and Megan, although primarily Rachael, unfolding the story for us one tiny layer of onion at a time, and this she - the author - did extremely well.- The depiction of sorrow, depression, abandonment, shame, jealously and how that all manifests itself in self-harm, in this case drinking.- The assumptions people naturally make about one another from the outside, and how that rarely if ever matches up to reality.- The fascinating way in which Rachael gets herself tangled up in the lives of strangers and past relationships.- The whole science around blacking out and memory loss.- The writing is exquisite. I enjoyed reading a current (2013) themed book for a change.Sadly, this is the kind of book you read just once, and it's so very good the first time around. Don't read any plot spoilers, grab the audio version and hey, if you're about to embark on reading this, I'm envious. Maybe I should read ""Gone Girl"" next! What do you think?"
788,Aishwarya,"Brilliantly written! While reading, you can totally relate to the feelings that Rachel goes through. You ought to feel sorry for her. The end of the story literally makes your jaw drop and makes you think ""oh my! This has been it?!?!?!""Also, many people didn't like it as much as I did. I lovvvvvveed it, especially after reading 'Pretty Girls' by Karin Slaughter. Different people different tastes. Peace ✌"
789,Elizabeth,"Everywhere I looked on our Spring break vacation, people were reading this book. And I suspect those reading on Kindle and tablet were doing the same. I loved it. I don't typically pick up thrillers. Only occasionally when I hear a lot of people talking about a book, will I voluntarily pick one up. And this one had a lot of buzz. I loved this book because I didn't like any of the characters. It sort of reminded me of Olive Kitteridge in that regard. But the book was nothing like that one. Can one call it a page turner when you read on a Kindle? It was a button pusher or a screen swiper! Didn't quite keep me guessing until the end, but I sure did want to race through."
790,TinaB,Heart pounding fabulous...!!! Its only January but my favorite read this year so far..... (RCS)
791,Joy,"So good! Now... how to stay spoiler-free?Heard a lot about ""The Girl On The Train"" being another ""Gone Girl"", which actually put me off choosing it for a while. Glad I downloaded it, because it was so much better. The characters - with one notable exception - were sympathetic. They were complicated because of their beliefs, weaknesses, and misunderstandings, not because they were bat guano crazy.Figured out who the ""bad guy"" was fairly early on, but was on the edge of my seat to find out exactly how it was all going to come out into the open."
792,Theresa,"I read this book almost a year ago and I still think about it. ""The Girl on the Train"" is either a book you will either love or hate, it's just one of those kind of books because it was so popular. I really liked how real and flawed Rachel was. She's a depressed, overweight, lonely, unemployed alcoholic still nursing romantic feelings for her cheating ex-husband, Tom. Rachel is NOT perfect which made her such a relatable and honest protagonist. I also enjoyed reading about Megan's traumatic past and turbulent present. She was another character that wasn't cookie-cutter or predictable, she was full of inner-conflict and self-loathing. And as for Anna, well...she was a stone-cold bitch but hey, at least she didn't pretend to be somebody she wasn't - warts and all. I really loved the emotion I felt when I read this book. Women are complicated creatures. I think we should embrace that truth and not criticize or run from it. A gripping psychological thriller. Enjoy! "
793,Blonde224,"First and for most I must say WOW just WOW this book was a roller coaster ride, Ive never read a book where the main character is constantly intoxicated. This book is a must read I do have to say it takes about 5 chapters to really get into the book. Once you get into the story it all starts to piece together quite nice. I love the fact that this book has you pinned you want to find out who did what etc.. I was not expecting the twist at all!! Did not see it coming at all.. If you are a fan of Gone girl you will deff love this book by far it kept me on my toes. I could not put this book down as I finished it in 2 days! I needed to get to the bottom of the story, I had to know who did it!!Thank you Paula for writing such a beautiful masterpiece !! 5/5"
794,Joe,"Books do not come any better than Girl on the Train. The plotting, the pacing, the characters, all of it, flawless. I was hooked from page one, read it practically in one sitting, and I see why so many people love it. Like Stephen King said, Hawkins nails that alcoholic narrator and uses the device to perfection. GOTT, like Gone Girl before it, is a perfect blend of literary and popcorn thriller. Simply put: a masterpiece."
795,Maureen,"If you liked Gone Girl you will love The Girl on the Train! The similarities are there - most obvious in the switching of viewpoints from one chapter to the next. Rachel drinks too much and is never sure of what she's done or what she thinks she remembers. Anna is her ex-husband's current wife. Megan is the perfect, beautiful neighbor. The scene is set, the mystery begins and off we all go! Expertly crafted, it is hard to put this one down, even though you may figure out what's coming. I felt for each of these women as the tension built and they shared their stories. All in all, a satisfying read - one that was hard to put down! "
796,Josie,"If I could give this 4.5 stars I would, but I rounded up. I thought the book was thrilling and suspenseful. The descriptions of Anna's drinking made me cringe! Which shows how well it was written, that I could really feel what these characters were going through. The lack of characters made me think the killer had to be someone we knew already, but it kept me guessing. Some parts bothered me, but I won't nitpick."
797,Alye,I could not read this fast enough. Brilliantly written and delivered. Loved how flawed the characters were and the three narrator format.
798,Jamie Holzberg / Fluff Smut & Murder,"Wow. OMG. So far, it’s the best suspense novel I’ve read this year. It does start out a little slow, but once the narration moves from Rachel to the other characters, the speed of the novel picks up like a traveling train, bits and pieces begin to fall into place, and then you see the ending coming like a train wreck and cannot stop reading because you have to know how it end and most importantly – why.What I loved: The red herrings, the misdirection – all brilliant ploys to disguise the truth.What I didn’t love: Rachel is not the most sympathetic of main characters for over half of the novel and it is hard to warm up to her, but I understand the author’s purpose within the story for making her so unlikable. What I learned: You never really know a person.Overall Grade: A"
799,Judi,I couldn't put it down!
800,Stefan Yannelli san roman,"I’ve only marathoned my way through books on three occasions, reading The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, The Martian by Andy Weir and now.After reading a couple of YA-novels I really needed a good dose of more mature writing and this book is beautifully written and captivating. Collins narration is extremely vivid and I can’t help but to fully immerse myself in the book. (I included a small excerpt from the book at the end.)Paula Hawkins manages to make you feel hate, love, disgust and pride towards the characters all at the same time. The characters in this book feel extremely realistic. They are multidimensional and have believable character development. The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins and The Martian by Andy Weir are definitely my top choices for 2015!“It’s a glorious evening, warm but not too close, the sun starting its lazy descent, shadows lengthening and the light just beginning to burnish the trees with gold. The train is rattling along, we whip past Jason and Jess’s place, they pass in a blur of evening sunshine. ”Excerpt From: Paula Hawkins. “The Girl on the Train.” "
801,Valerie,"The Girl on the Train is a best-selling novel by British author Paula Hawkins. The novel debuted at number one on the The New York Times Fiction Best Sellers of 2015 list dated February 1, 2015. It was the first book recommended by a book group promoted by the ITV television programme, Loose Women. Coleen Nolan, the singer of The Nolan Sisters fame suggested this book. I had not read anything by Paula Hawkins, but the title caught my interest.Although Paula Hawkins was born in Harare, Zimbabwe, on 26 August, 1972, she now She was educated at Oxford University, Oxford, England and now lives in London. She worked as a journalist for many years before writing The Girl on the Train which is her first thriller, although it is her fifth novel. The earlier works are romantic fiction written under the pseudonym, Amy Silver. The Girl on the Train has sold more than 120,000 copies in hardback since January, and sales of ebooks and copies in other countries are at around 2m. The US market has taken to it especially – the book has been at the top of the New York Times bestseller list for 13 weeks, and the film rights have been bought by DreamWorks. In The Girl on the Train, Rachel, the ""girl"" in the title is a divorced woman in her 30s who staggers along, unsteady and unsure. On her daily, morning commute, the train always stops at the same signal and Rachel starts to become obsessed with the couple whose garden backs on to the train tracks. They have, she believes, a perfect life. Rachel, herself, is being sucked under by alcoholism and the heartbreak of her failed marriage. However, she is shocked by something she sees in the couple's garden one day. Shortly afterwards, the woman goes missing and Rachel becomes entangled in their lives for real. This is complicated by the fact that she suffers from blackouts and memory loss, and is such a mess that neither the police nor the woman’s husband can trust what she says. The Girl on the Train is more than a straightforward crime thriller; at its heart are the threats, pressures and judgments made on women. These include, domestic violence to ageing and to how they approach motherhood. Although there is a murder and the victim is female, it does not feel like the gratuitous, sexualised murders of attractive young women that pile up in so much crime fiction. It is a beautifully crafted book. I enjoyed it far more than I thought I would, so, if you enjoy a good thriller, I highly recommend The Girl on the Train. Valerie Penny"
802,Kassie Adams,I listened to the audio book with my husband. We thoroughly enjoyed this book. At first we were confused with all the different characters narrating but once we sorted it out we became engulfed in this mystery. Loved the ending and loved the story! 
803,Judy,very exciting
804,Amie,"While I cannot say I really liked any of the characters in this book, I did like the book. I read it in three days, so I would say it is a fast read.Oh, and how ironic-I was so into it, I almost missed my stop on the subway-seriously!"
805,Joe Jones,How well can we trust our memories? Can we really know another person? Two questions to ponder as the story of a woman’s disappearance slowly unfolds. Told from multiple viewpoints we have to decipher the truth based on some very unreliable narrators. I can see this one being a popular pick with readers. 
806,Laurel Osterkamp,Very clever and suspenseful. I did not see the twist coming. The characters were flawed but compelling.
807,Mike Cuthbert,"Rachel Watson is the girl on the train. She is there every day because she is trying to keep up appearances of being at work and valuable to someone after being dumped by her husband, Tom. He dumped her because she is a boozer—gin and tonic in a can is her drink of choice—but he didn’t wait very long before hooking up with Anna whom he subsequently married. Tom and Anna live in the house Rachel used to share with Tom and, as the train passes each day, Rachel is able to get a glimpse of their new life as she passes by. Needless to say, it’s like tearing the scab off an old wound every time she sees them. It’s made clear that Rachel is still in love with Tom, though it is certainly not reciprocated. One couple she sees each day in her stupor she idealizes and even re-names as Jess and Jason. Things start to go off the track one day when she sees Jess lip-locked with a guy who is NOT Jason. The idyllic relationship she has created for her couple is thus shattered. We discover that, far from ideal, the marriage between “Jess and Jason” is not solid and Jess (aka Megan) is coming apart thanks to Megan’s love for her therapist. As Megan disappears, and her husband, Scott, despairs, Rachel tries to inject herself into the investigation surrounding her disappearance. Unfortunately, when she does try to help she is often in an alcoholic stupor which makes her a less-than reliable witness or informant. Rachel uses the investigation as a form of therapy for herself but she can’t escape the confusion alcohol brings and she ends up trying to kidnap Tom and Anna’s baby. This is a pathetic act, brought about in part by alcohol and partly from the fact that Rachel is sterile and frustrated for many years because of it. Adding to the complexity is the fact that Megan, being out of work and at loose ends, becomes nanny to Tom and Anna’s baby and, unfortunately for her, Tom’s mistress. Tom has strong sperm and they soon attack Megan’s womb and she becomes pregnant, Scott discovering that he is not the father. One of the odd factors of the book comes to light gradually: nobody seems offended by anything that the others do. There is little blame placed though there is much to go around. Perhaps too much. What started as a dreamy mash-up of “Peyton Place” and “Rear Window” turns into its own type—a demented thriller that has enthralled millions from this first-time author. A complex but very satisfactory read."
808,Erin,"This book is written in the point of view of three of the characters in the story. Mainly it is written by Rachel, a divorced woman who imploded and spiraled into drinking and depression. Fired from her job, she continues to ride the train to and from work daydreaming about the people she sees from her train window. I don't want to give too much away. It took me longer than normal to ""get into"" the book, but once I did I couldn't put it down. I was very VERY surprised by the ending. Certainly didn't see it coming!! A highly enjoyable thriller that keeps you guessing right up until the end!!"
809,Kristine Hansen,"This is one of those books that I was thinking about even when I wasn't reading it. My go-to book when I was waiting in lines or at the doctor's office, that would engross me to the point where I would forget I was waiting for anything at all. (Unlike that book on my nightstand that I glance at and get that surprised ""oh yeah, I'm reading that. I should finish that sometime."") The Girl on the Train demands your attention and is very hard to put down.When I first picked up the book I was angry that the flap on the inside cover let me know the narrator was unreliable. But then when I started reading, I realized that myself within the first handful of pages. This will probably be one of my favorite books of the year, where the reader is invited to see the ending of the story and watch how it unraveled in a sort of drunken stupor that makes you vow to never drink again by the end of the book. (Not a hard vow for me, as I'm not a drinker, but dang, this book is enough to make anyone long for sobriety). I was annoyed at Rachel way too often. I hated most of the characters. Yet I couldn't stop. And I refuse to tell more about it here as there are enough spoilers in the reviews already.So yeah...worth reading for many reasons. "
810,Cathy Elliott,"This was a stunning thriller! It captivated me in tone rather like The House of Mirth by Edith Wharton, a favorite book of mine. That sad spiral downward that I didn't want to travel with the character, but so well written, so intimate in voice, that I couldn't help myself! I kept thinking, ""No, Rachel! No! Don't do it..."" when she'd be about to repeat a bad decision. ""Don't you ever learn?"" I hung on to the end, hoping that she would become the hero of her own story, with my doubts growing. Some of the situations were difficult for this (usually) cozy-mystery writer. But they all supported the story, adding to the angst of both characters & reader. Hat's off to Paula Hawkins. What a stellar first novel. Congratulations!"
811,Diana Botto,Loved it!!! Never wanted to read a book so fast to get to the end! Very good novel of suspense
812,Marin Thomas,"Wow...from page one this book grabbed my attention and didn't let go. Hawkins' characters are so flawed that it was almost too painful to read their chapters. The author did an excellent job keeping me guessing until the later half of the book when I saw where the story ending was headed. This is a gripping story full of angst, pain, anger, dysfunction. If you're looking for a feel-good reading experience this isn't it--but if you're looking for a story that rips your gut open and doesn't let you go until the very end then this is your book!"
813,Eric,Great murder mysteryRead entire book in 24 hours. Story is told from each lead female characters point of view. Very clever and a worthy read 
814,Bruno Neves Pires Silva,"Este livro que está há 8 semanas em primeiro lugar na lista de best sellers do New York Times (http://goo.gl/zww74), é um suspense eletrizante, que atiça curiosidade, que não deixa vc largar o livro enquanto não souber o final.Incrível porque é o primeiro livro dessa moça do Zimbábue, Paula Hawkins, que vive em Londres desde os 17 anos.A Editora Record vai lançar esse livro no Brasil em junho."
815,Blanca,"I finished this in one day. I could not put the book down. It was easy to read and really a great thriller. Well, written and the characters are strong and unforgettable.It begins slowly but once more information is discovered the roller coaster ride begins and you cannot get off of it until you find out who done it. Female characters are damaged and untrustworthy and the males appear to be strong and protective but then things turn upside down.Wonderful book, no wonder it on the best seller list. My highest recommendation to all."
816,Asia,Dont compare this to Gone Girl the story. Its the same genre of mind eff for sure though.But not the same.This was well thought out story. She left you thinking it was one person on one page and another person a few pages later. It was a fun train ride for sure.
817,Gilly,"Non guarderete più fuori dal finestrino con gli stessi occhi...Recensione presente anche sul blog: http://gillyinbooksland.blogspot.it/2...“Il caso editoriale più esplosivo del 2015” così reca la fascetta sul romanzo … La Ragazza del Treno è stato definito un vero e proprio “page turner” ovvero che ti spinge, in parole povere, a girare pagina, andare avanti nella lettura compulsivamente e per quanto mi riguarda non potevano trovare termine più adatto!Una volta cominciato infatti mi è stato letteralmente impossibile staccarmene e considerando che non appartiene al mio genere preferito, è veramente incredibile … non me l’aspettavo!Ciò che mi ha spinto a leggerlo è stato il fatto che anche a me è capitato spesso di viaggiare in treno (più negli anni passati che ora) e anche io, come Rachel, mi chiedevo come fosse la vita delle persone che incontravo in viaggio, oppure di chi era in macchina sulle autostrade che spesso costeggiano i binari, oppure di chi vive nelle case sempre nei pressi dei treni. Certo … non sono mai arrivata ad attribuire nomi fittizi o a concentrarmi più volte sulle stesse persone ma capisco perfettamente quanto la mente possa vagare e giocare di immaginazione quando non si ha nulla da fare … se poi si considera che Rachel ha un motivo più che valido per soffermarsi su quella casa e sulla via su cui essa sorge si capisce ben presto l’ossessione della ragazza.Ad ogni modo si tratta di un thriller e non voglio rivelare nulla per non rovinare il piacere della lettura …Rachel è una ragazza un po’ borderline con un serio problema con l’alcol e durante i suoi quotidiani viaggi in treno verso Londra si ritrova ad osservare la vita all’interno di una casa in particolare fino a che, un giorno, i suoi occhi vedono un qualcosa che la scuote nel profondo … e della trama non rivelerò più nulla.“Quella Rachel se ne frega delle conseguenze: è in preda a deliri di ottimismo oppure accecata dall’odio. Non ha un passato e nemmeno un futuro: vive soltanto nel momento.”Rachel però non è l’unica voce narrante del libro. Ne La Ragazza del Treno infatti tre donne si contendono la scena e le loro storie per quanto diverse e strutturate su livelli temporali diversi si ritroveranno a percorrere lo stesso binario che ci condurrà verso il finale!Paula Hawkins ha scritto un libro davvero particolare e avvincente. Complice uno stile decisamente semplice sono stata trascinata a forza dentro il libro e dentro la storia di queste tre donne diverse ma inesorabilmente legate da un destino terribile … tre donne apparentemente comuni ma che solo pian piano, particolare dopo particolare, si apprende quanto sia complicata e unica la loro vita.Vorrei dire e aggiungere altro ma rischierei di rovinare quel finale che invece dovete gustarvi sorso dopo sorso …Perciò mettervi comodi, salite sul treno e preparatevi al più particolare e avvincente dei viaggi perché una volta arrivati a destinazione non guarderete più fuori dal finestrino con gli stessi occhi!"
818,Kimberly Kay Mcbride,I loved it! I'm glad I stuck through the first 100 pages because it just got better and better. It reminded me of a Hitchcock movie. 
819,Mary Beth Busby,Wow! What a terrific vacation read....thank you Tammy Siegel! Kept my attention from beginning to end. Great psychological thriller with plenty of twists and turns
820,Sarah Pearce,"I love birthdays. You get stuff you probably would never buy for yourself. My son gave me an iTunes gift card for my recent birthday. And, in anticipation of a long solo drive, I purchased this book on audio. Audiobooks are not cheap and you have to be careful what you choose. Or you could end up falling asleep at the wheel! However, this particular book is ideal for the audiobook medium as it is entirely in first person with both of the main characters, Rachel and Megan, relating their interior monologues. And because it is in first person, you get the feeling, as it is read to you, that the characters are actually speaking to you. Thus there is an instant and personal connection. Plus, this is a compelling story of Rachel, an alcoholic voyeur with an active imagination, building a story in her mind about a couple, Megan and Scott. Rachel watches this couple, who live in a house on the tracks of a commuter train Rachel rides each day. Then we get to hear Megan's side of the story. I won't give it away because it took me by surprise. It also helps that the three actors reading the story have amazing voices. This is a rather sad and depressing story but some of the take-away lessons and insights are worth the read/listen..however you choose to enjoy this book."
821,Pirate,"Wonderful and original thriller and makes you think how many people while away their daily commute -- though the heroine's is not exactly a normal one -- with creative thoughts to ease the daily boring grind of the journey. Heroine's character may well strike a chord with male and females alike in her battle with drink and the awful realisation of the downward spiral and the loss of memory etcetra, embarrassment and on and on. All the characters are well drawn and I would gladly recommend it to all, with a fantastic unexpected climax...although I guessed the killer halfway through....but that is no criticism. Terrific. "
822,Karen Pink,"I'm currently listening to, rather than reading, The Girl on the Train but I can't resist writing a review. It is being compared, a LOT, to Gone Girl and fair enough there are some similarities I guess. However, as much as I loved Gone Girl, I really love this. The protagonist is superb and much different to anything I've come across before. I recommend that if you haven't yet bought it, buy the audio version, as the reading is fantastic and listening to this book is enthralling. I keep overrunning on tasks such as cleaning my teeth in order to not stop. If you're hesitating don't! Buy it!"
823,Carrie Ann,"Unexpected!I didn't expect to like this one so much! It had so many emotions in it. You can't help but loathe and yet feel sorry for Rachel's condition, I loved the story told between the 3 women. Great unexpected ending! Can't wait for the movie."
824,Monica Vidal,"Fan-fucking-tactic! A thriller to keep you glued to the book from the moment you open it to the end of it. I found some similarities to ""Gone Girl"" and I can totally see this one being made into a movie too. I'd absolutely watch it! "
825,J.P.,"	I have heard many people compare this book to Gone Girl. I really liked Gone Girl, but even that book didn’t get five stars from me. The Girl on the Train did. I am stingy with that fifth star, so this shows how much I enjoyed this book. 	The Girl on the Train is the story about a woman named Rachel struggling with alcoholism and is still trying to come to grips with her failed marriage. She spends much of her time riding a commuter train back and forth from her apartment to a job she no longer has.	During the trips, the train frequently stops at a signal where Rachel can look upon a house just a few doors down from where she used to live. At this house, she watches a couple and believes they have the dream life. She knows nothing about them, but has built the story of their life in her own mind.	She soon learns more about them then she ever expected and becomes embroiled in a mystery. Despite knowing her shortcomings, she just cannot resist getting more involved than she should.	Author Paula Hawkins captures the personalities of her characters brilliantly. The book is told entirely from the first person perspective, but the perspective shifts between three different women. While that might sound like it could get confusing, it was actually quite easy to distinguish the three different characters. They led very different lives and had their differing personalities.	It was very interesting to read how Rachel saw an event, and then see how one of the other characters saw it. The viewpoints told different stories and did a good job of preventing me from solving the mystery too quickly. I figured out what had happened earlier than I expected, but I realized that was probably Hawkins’ intent. Thanks to the knowledge, I got to join in the feeling of dread as I watched the characters walk into trouble I knew was coming.	The first person narrative also allows the reader into the heads of these people. That was especially important for getting to know Rachel. The woman was very screwed up. That would have been obvious even if it was told from the third person, but by making it first, you got to read the mental ramblings, the broken reasoning, the frustration, and pain straight from her mind. The reader can feel just how screwed up Rachel has become because of her past.	There are times you just want to shake some sense into her as she continually does things that screws up her own life, but creates trouble for those around her. While she intended to help, she proved to be very unhelpful throughout the story and gets herself deeper and deeper into trouble.	Hawkins’ pacing of this story was perfect. You get to know Rachel quickly and see the monotony of her life from the opening pages. But you feel the tension as well. The tension grows fast as she witnesses something she never wanted to see. The mystery unravels in a way to where you just cannot resist turning to the next page.	Because I am usually a late night reader with a day job that requires me out of bed early, I had to force myself to put the book down and crash several times during the week I read it. But as the pace picked up, my reading sessions grew longer, my desire for sleep grew less. I read the final 80 pages in one marathon read, a marathon for me anyway, because the race to the climax was too good to stop.	This is a must read for any fans of Gillian Flynn. Even if you aren’t, or have never read Flynn’s book, I strongly recommend this one. There are only two other books to which I would consider five star books."
826,Aimee Salter,"very, very goodI spent 90% of this book with my head spinning with trying to figure out what was going on. I love that."
827,Dot,"I'm a librarian, so I see lots of booklists and read plenty of reviews. I knew that ""The Girl on the Train"" was a book I would be reading as soon as it was delivered in our next book shipment. This book did NOT disappoint! I absolutely devoured it in about three days (and that's only because I couldn't devote every waking moment to it). I simply couldn't put it down. Here's the crazy part....I figured things out about halfway through the book and still couldn't put it down. That's how much of a page-turner it was for me. Rachel is a young British woman who rides the commuter train to work in London each day just like clockwork...the 8:04 train in the morning and the 5:56 train in the evening. During her daily commute, she sees the same houses and people outside her seat's window at a certain signal stop and begins to feel like she knows them. Well, that is, she knows them via the fictional life she has made up for them in her mind (she's even given them names and occupations!). So, she sees ""Jess & Jason"" each day on their deck and they are the perfect couple...in fact, they remind her of the REAL life she used to have just a few doors down from them in the same neighborhood not too many years ago. However, Rachel no longer has that perfect life. In fact, her ex-husband, new wife, and baby girl still live in that house, which is also a source of pain on her daily train ride. One day on her commute, she witnesses something at Jess & Jason's house that would suggest they don't have the perfect life either. This new information consumes Rachel and she feels she needs to help, but Rachel has problems of her own and perhaps she's not seeing things clearly. Due to some deep-seated personal demons, Rachel has become her own worst enemy. Would authorities believe her if she came forward? Is it even a good idea to get involved? Are ""Jess & Jason"" even close to who she's dreamed up in her head? The story is told from the perspective of the three women in the book...Rachel...Megan (Jess's real name)...and Anna (the woman who stole Rachel's husband away from her). It's hard for me to believe that this is the author's first book. Paula Hawkins does an incredible job of weaving these three women's stories together in this suspenseful thriller! This is one of those books that leave me sad because it's over. I hope Ms. Hawkins is already busy on her second novel. I'm ready to put it in a future library order! :)"
828,Susan Moss,"The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins (finished 2/11/15): Note to Self: Do *not* start what you know to be a page-turner novel two days before one is to have dinner company, and four days before one is to present a big concert. Worried that I'd have to feed my guests delivery pizza... or that my audience would enter to an empty stage, I was compelled to finish this book in less than 24 hours (that's my excuse and I'm sticking to it... :-)First of all, it employs my favorite literary device: alternating narrators (swoon). The writing is fast-paced, the characters' human frailties and feelings are believable, and the plot zig zags just often enough to keep you guessing, but not so much as to make you dizzy.“Hollowness: that I understand. I'm starting to believe that there isn't anything you can do to fix it. That's what I've taken from the therapy sessions: the holes in your life are permanent. You have to grow around them, like tree roots around concrete; you mold yourself through the gaps.”I did feel as if I'd figured it out with about 100 pages to go, but maybe she meant to do that, such that I was feeling quite clever, but was really only being manipulated. I daresay (Britishspeak) it's the new Gone Girl (and I mean that in the best possible way!)."
829,Katherine Dennihy,This is an amazing book. I was guessing the whole way through. I loved the characterizations and switching narrators.
830,Jordana Horn Gordon,Wow. Comparisons to Gone Girl due to subject matter but the more fair comparison is in how this is a page-turner that you can't put down.
831,Margarita,"When you read for leisure, you do it to entertain yourself. When you read for school, it's to learn and get a good grade on a test. Sometimes leisure reading can provide both entertainment and education, sometimes it just provides entertainment. This book provides entertainment and it did its job well. Sometimes we just need to read for the pleaser of reading and not be so critical of the way a book was written. This book was not meant to be part of an English literary class, it was just meant to entertain and it did. I loved it!"
832,Christina ,"This one I finished at the speed of light partly because it's unputdownable, partly because I didn't have to stop every few sentences to proofread or correct usage in my head. Kudos to the author on her winning debut effort and to Penguin for their ongoing commitment to quality. How rare professional copyediting has become in the publishing industry."
833,Shari Stertz,"I really liked this one and I especially enjoyed the ending- truly vindication for Rachel. Well-written, and, though a little slow in the beginning, it was really quite a fun ride.Quotes""Cathy's a nice person, in a forceful sort of way. She makes you notice her niceness.""""I can't get comfortable, because every way I turn I run into dead ends; the closed gallery, the houses on this road, the stifling attentions of the tedious pilates, the track at the end of the garden with its trains, always taking someone else to somewhere else, reminding me over and over and over, a dozen times a day that I'm staying put.""ReflectionThis one is still weighing on my mind...wow. Just such an edge of your seat ride. I kind of want to read it again. And I don't usually re-read books."
834,Hayfa Yehya,"Amazing. Everything about it is amazing from the characters and their personality (or should i say personalities) that are cleverly chosen, to the plot that is intriguing, to the style of the author. I loved how she tells the story from different perspectives. Each chapter would be from a different person's view. The reader will try to resolve the mystery and analyses to find the killer, gathering every piece of information available to be surprised at the end... (i will not give a spoiler). You should read the book to find out. I enjoyed every detail in it."
835,Beverly,"I'm not sure what I expected but this was another great read (listen) for this month, I'm on a roll!! The audio was read by 3 different readers who were fine but I thought their voices were so similar that they were difficult to tell apart. This example of unreliable narration reminded me so much of Gone Girl but I liked this so much better. Rachel takes the train into London every day and every day she pays close attention to one house. The house is very close to where she used to live, before she and her husband broke up, and she loves to watch the young couple there having their breakfast. They seem to be a perfect couple. She has even named them--Jess and Jason. But one morning, she sees something she can hardly believe and soon nothing can stop her from entangling herself in something that can only go from bad to worse. This is the definitive book for helping you to remember to mind your own business!! :)"
836,Charlie Hay,"Rachel catches the same commuter train every morning. She can’t help but stare into the gardens and windows of the houses that back onto the line. She knows the train will wait at the same signal every time. Same signal. Same train. Until she’s sees something shocking. But I shouldn’t be telling you too much about the plot. The author has perfectly structure the book to keep you guessing, keep you on your toes. It is unpredictable, which is what makes it one of the stand out thrillers of this year.It’s not just about the girl on the train. There’s also the girl in the house and the new girl. Each chapter is told by one of these three women and at different periods of time. When you think you know what’s happening, you’re left in doubt as each narrator has their own version of events. No one can be trusted. Rachel is an alcoholic. Megan has tainted views of Rachel after being told stories from her husband. Anna is hiding something from everyone.What was refreshing about this novel was how ‘normal’ it all was. It’s not the story of psychopath killing as many people as possible while being chased by a rouge cop with his own problems. Its flawed human beings making mistakes and bad choices. It’s all behaviours we are also guilty of. Peeping in houses through the train windows. Painting your ex as a mad, bad, sad woman. We are capable of terrible crimes and we can also be victims just like the characters in this book. It’s all too real.The way in which I read The Girl on Train speaks volumes about how good it is. I was up until 4am. I had to know what was happening. I had to know the truth. As I said, there are many twists and turns and red herrings. All the clues are in front of you but everyone is coming to different conclusions. Everyone I’ve spoken to has had their own theory. None were right. It’s a testament to the brilliance of the book. It demands to be read and talked about."
837,Karen Brooks,"I wasn’t quite sure what to expect from this novel as it entered the literary world with both a great deal of hype as well as comparisons to the hugely successful book, Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn.I am delighted to say, this was a terrific read. Sharing more in common with Flynn’s work than the use of “girl” in lieu of “woman”in the title, such as the notion of unreliable narrator/s, it's an original, dark and compelling story told from three female points of view. The primary narrator is Rachel, the “girl” on the train who, when travelling to and from her work daydreams about an apparently loving couple she sees for a few seconds each time the train pauses on its journey and who happen to live a few doors down from her old house. Inventing a life and even names for them, she invests heavily in her imaginary scenario so much so, one day, when she sees something that doesn’t accord with her imagined view of their world, she is distressed. When she discovers the young woman she has named “Jess” is missing, she is compelled to uncover the truth of what she thinks she saw and what it might mean.Things, however, are a little more complicated than a blurring of the lines between fact and fantasy, or adhering to the adage “seeing is believing”. It just so happens Rachel was in the area the night the woman, whose real name is Megan, goes missing. Rachel knows something terrible has happened and she may have borne witness to events. The only problem is, Rachel is an alcoholic who has “blackouts” and cannot recall what occurred or even if anything did…But she has snatches of memory… snippets of images and very strong feelings that she cannot dismiss. Do they mean something or is it the drink playing tricks?The other two narrators are Rachel’s ex-husband’s new wife, the young mother, Anna, who lives a few doors down from the missing Megan (who is the third narrator), and in the same house Rachel used to dwell in and which represented such promise and happiness, until her marriage unravelled.The three women’s stories and, indeed, version of events, are all interwoven with Rachel’s painful and desperate need to recall, interfere and discover what is true, what is not, and overcome her battle with the bottle and the demons of her past being dominant.I don’t want to give away too much about this plot because it is clever. There were times I thought, how on earth is Hawkins going to pull this off? There is no way I am going to be able to suspend my disbelief regarding this…. But I did. The reader does, and that’s because the flawed and oft-times pathetic and frustrating narrators of this macabre tale are as believable and human as are the stupid, reckless and tragic decisions they make and the lives of those they draw into their stories and actions.Light on police procedural (which is where I struggled a bit with some of the actions and behaviour of characters), this is far more a psychological thriller that plumes the depths of perception, of memory, of how we construct our lives, make excuses, accord blame, and reinvent ourselves in an effort to erase the past and shore up a future. It’s how the same people can view an identical event in completely different ways and react accordingly.It is also about manipulation, violence – emotional, psychological and physical - betrayal (of ourselves as well) and the impact this has on others.Once I started this tale, I could not put it down and felt quite wrung out at the end. Like the train Rachel rides, you hop on board and find yourself hurtling towards a destination that even if you see it coming, the arrival is daunting and haunting.A great and unexpected novel containing beautiful prose and some genuinely marvellous reflections on people and life, featuring weak and real characters embroiled in events that will chill and thrill, this is a cracker of a read."
838,Lonna Pierce,"A chilling adult thriller with multiple disjointed, dated entries confuse and tantalize the reader. An unreliable narrator, (Think ""Gone Girl."")Rachel, a divorced drunk, is sliding down a black hole of depression and self-loathing. Though she lost her job months ago, she continues to ""commute"" daily on the train to London. She passes her former ""happy home"" on the way next to the tracks. It is now occupied by her ex, Tom, his wife, Anna, and their toddler, Evie. Also on Blenheim Rd. a few doors down are Megan & Scott, who appear to live an idyllic life, from Rachel's vantage point on the train. Then Megan goes missing, Rachel gets inextricably involved, and the mystery twists like a knife into your heart. Read it."
839,BookWitch_Namine," I was thinking it may end up 4* but golly, the ending was amazing. I just finished the book and I'm kind of speechless. One thing I noticed, the grammar was different. There's no problem in that. I just found learning the differences interesting through reading it. A well-written book (vocabulary, literary devices, plot, etc.), a first experience, according to my memory, of British grammar (not too different from American/English.) OK, now the actual contents of the book. Only recently have I been taking note of things such as where the author is from and if it is a debut. I think if debut novels are this good, someone give me a list. The dates subtitled in the story are important, well, some of them are, so I advise keep note of the dates and changes in time or confusion may arise. The story is told through three women: Rachel, Megan, Anna. Megan has quite the tale. Rachel was like my child. I felt proud when she stopped touching the alcohol. I liked how she connected the pieces of her memory and didn't get so offended being a terrible category of ugly (Sad, isn't it?). One thing that slightly bothered was she calling, texting, 'visiting' her ex-husband. Anna wasn't much of my favorite because she was like all for Tom and like I said, Rachel is like my child. The story mainly revolves around Rachel. Megan has more of a role in the story than Anna in terms of the story-telling perspective. They have a lot of problems in their lives, exes and lust, insomnia and blackouts, lying and cheating, etc. etc. I liked that about the story for a reason I can't explain. There's the police and detective involved whom I did not like honestly. The men in this story besides the therapist, Scott and Tom,...wow. Scott ""Jason"" wasn't my favorite character. Scott is Megan ""Jess""'s husband. The funny thing is how in  The Heroes of Olympus Series, I didn't like Jason. Scott did bother me a lot. I hated him for the paranoid way he acts. TOM. TOM. TOM. Oh, how happy I am you're damned in hell! This man is not just an ex-husband of Rachel, husband of Anna, father of Evie. Oh, awaiting readers, you'll see what I mean.  This story is all twists and turns. I'm a perceptive person but this story is nearly impredictable. Some twists are nice though predictable. The last 60 something pages were mind-boggling. That kept the story very interesting and I would be telling random people ""OMG RACHEL WHY? I NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO RACHEL."" or ""...AND THEN SHE DIED AND RACHEL STOPPED DRINKING AND..."". Just all the twists made this story perfect. Of course, and the wonderful phrases and sentences far more than worthy to be recognized as quotes. Any few words can be quotes. This author's words were worthy of that. A wonderful debut thriller. I can certainly see why so many people love this book. "
840,Alexis Whitzell,Very clever suspense novel! I really enjoyed it! 
841,Rachael Conrad,"I avoided reading this one for a while because I was worried that its constant comparison to Gone Girl (a personal favorite of mine) would be untrue... which they were. Yes, this is a gripping thriller, and, yes this is a mystery but that is where the similarities end. While Amazing Amy is dazzling and brilliant (and undeniably brutal), Rachel, the titular girl on the train, is decidedly human, as are most of the characters who occupy this story. And what a story it is! I finished this one off in three days and hardly put it down. It's unsettling and spooky from the first page to the last. If you're a fan of thrillers that will leave you guessing (and second guessing your guesses) then I recommend reading this one ASAP. (reviews can also be found on instagram at #rachaelreviews)"
842,ليلى المطوع,انتهيت منها خلال 6 ساعات رواية ممتعة ومشوقة للغاية 
843,Teresa,Absolutely fantastic. Best book i've read in years.
844,Tara Mcpartland bridges,Couldn't put it down! Done in 2 days!
845,Marydawnschuck,I loved this book!
846,Alan S Hiwa,"Rating: 4.5 The girl on the train is told from the perspective of three different women, Rachel, Megan and Anna. and from different time periods 2012 and 2013. Rachel is the main character, who is alcoholic and takes the train everyday to work, Megan is the typical suburban housewife, and Anna is the most ""sane"" out of the three. and their lives is intertwined somehow... I enjoyed the writing, it was straightforward, but nothing fancy, i would have enjoyed it more if it was a bit more poetical with good quotes, but it wasn't bad. The character development was great, even the side characters had good development through out the book. I didn't figure out the twist easily, so props to Paula Hawkins for crafting such a good Thriller/Mystery book."
847,Jo Hughes,"I would like to thank Transworld Publishing for approving me on NetGalley in exchange for a fair and honest review.As you all know I’m not a thriller reader, preferring chick lit or fantasy. I had heard so many wonderful comments about this book that I thought I would stick my toe in the world of thrillers and give this a read.The story is told from the point of view of the three main female characters, Rachel, Megan and Anna.Rachel is the main lead character but she isn’t your typical main character, she is very flawed with so many problems that I wouldn’t know where to start, she passes the same houses every day and gazes at a couple whose life she wishes she had, thinking everything is perfect. ‘Jess and Jason’s’ life is far from the perfect picture in her head, catching a glimpse one day in passing takes Rachel on a voyage of discovery, not just about Jess and Jason but about herself, her past and her alcohol addiction.I have read that someone found this hard to get into, what I found was that it is a little confusing to start offwith as it switches between main characters, and also years, this all becomes clear later in the book and it is a unique way of showing the background to a story without it being told to another character in the book. I ended where I really enjoyed how the story was told in this way, it was confusing but in a good way.So what do I think of it? Especially given that I’m not into reading thrillers, I did enjoy the story on the whole and the more I got into it I wanted to find out what had happened. I was gripped by the story and the twists and turns in parts had my head spinning.Would I read any more thrillers? Yes, I would. This is a tense, gripping story that had me on the edge of my seat, I was intrigued with what would happen next always wondering who? An excellent debut and I will look out for more books by Paula. I think anyone that loves a good thriller will really enjoy this book. I’m off back to chick lit and fantasy for now but will be dipping my toe in to more thrillers this year."
848,Margaret Dilloway,"Great thriller with highly dysfunctional, unlikable women characters (which I happen to like, which makes me think I should try writing thrillers instead of women's fiction, because ""difficult women"" happen to be my speciality). I usually guess what happens fairly early on but I did not with this until pretty late in the book. Quick read, too. I think people who were dismayed with the ending of GONE GIRL will find this one more satisfying."
849,Amy (Stockton) Nobbe,reminiscent of Gone Girl with a MUCH better ending. I enjoyed this one.
850,Alejandra,"And so the Gone Girl phenomena continues! When a theme hits and scores with the people, authors must milk it until it runs dry, huh? Just hope this doesn't turn into a Da Vinci Code thing because if so, it will loose all its glory.On to the review!Rachel commutes every day to London on the train. To pass the time, she looks out the window and looks at the houses she passes by. One in particular has her attention though, and she slowly starts to create a story for the couple she snoops on.All is well and whatnot until she sees something unusual. It's that day she decides to start participating in the lives of this couple and it's that day everything starts going wrong. Very wrong.I don't want to say anything more because I don't want to give anything else away because this is a book that needs to be read so you can find out the messed up story hidden in it. I will say though, that the character of Rachel is one of the most pathetic I have ever read. I can't express how much I dislike this woman! In my world, when a book makes you develop such strong feelings, be they good or bad, it is one fine written book.I look forward to reading more by Hawkins and I deeply hope it won't be another Gone Girl emulation."
851,Vera Neves (Sinfonia dos Livros),"OMG.... alguma coisa me dizia que tinha sido aquela pessoa a culpada!!!!Juro que não estava à espera disto! De uma história destas! Se no início eu estava a detestar as personagens, não pela maneira como elas foram criadas, mas sim pela maneira de elas agirem umas com as outras, sempre cheias de mesquinhices e fraquezas, não levou muito tempo a que eu ficasse simplesmente siderada por elas. O facto da narração ser em trio, Rachel, Megan e Anna, ajuda imenso a que sejamos completamente absorvidas pelo que elas dizem. sentem, fazem e pensam. São três personagens cheias de sentimentos contraditórios e cheias de emoções reprimidas.Opinião Completahttp://sinfoniadoslivros.blogspot.pt/..."
852,Tami,"Creepy, but so good!"
853,Cleide Martins,"Para quem gosta do gênero, vale mesmo a pena ler este livro. Ao início, não prende muito, mas a dada altura não se consegue parar de ler. Muito bom, mesmo. "
854,Adriane Devries,"From page one we feel sorry for protagonist Rachel, self-professed alcoholic and all-around loser: divorced, unemployed, living in a bedroom of an old school mate’s apartment that is barely big enough to walk in. She has no money or life to speak of except for her daily train route, a pretense of still going in to work to keep her landlord at bay as finances continue to dwindle. On this commute, she passes by her old home, where she spent several happy years with her ex-husband before her marriage, and mind, began to unravel. Now, watching these homes in her old neighborhood, she becomes obsessed with the lives she sees behind French doors and in sunny gardens along the rail track, the seeming utopian bliss she so desperately wishes to recapture. Through her typical boozy haze, she is caught off-guard one morning when she sees a startling change in the status quo, which sets off a horrifying chain of events fraught with murder, deceit, and maddening twists of perception that leave the reader guessing until the very end. Engrossing and intelligent like Hitchcock’s Rear Window, A Girl on the Train is a gripping thriller that will rob you of your ability to sleep until you discover the dreadful truth. The brilliant audiobook performances of Louse Brealey, India Fisher and Clare Corbett add thrilling new paranoia to your morning jogs in suburbia."
855,Maricarmen Merchan,Excelente thriller que te tiene sin aliento hasta la última página . Merecí disipas las buenas críticas recibidas por los medios americanos y británicos . Será una de las novelas de este verano .
856,TheWellReadLady,"Well, well, well! May have just found the hot new darling of the crime novel scene. ‘The Girl On The Train’ is in works for a movie, which I can see as this is a very visual book. The new 'Gone Girl' for 2015. And only her debut to boot!""Now look. Now look what you made me do"" is a creepy little opener to this fabulously un-putdownable novel. The scene is set, the crime is underway, the tension is there. Hawkins is an ex-journalist, and I can see how that career has seeped into this book as the writing is taught and snappy. One minute you think you may have sussed it all out, but the next page, that's all in the dust and you sit there thinking 'like what the hell just happened there?' We all know that Rachel (our main protagonist) is super-flawed, an alcoholic with a crazy imagination, but we can't really trust, or like, the other two narrators of this tale, Anna and Megan, either. All three have issues, all three can be nasty little bitches, all three can be utterly charming at times. The tale of the unreliable narrator - who can we trust, if anybody at all? As Rachel, our train journeyer, states several times, “something bad has happened” and she tries her best to help solve the crime, but can she trust her alcohol-fuzzed memories? Hawkins kind of reminds me of Gillian Flynn, but I think Paula Hawkins is more fast-paced with her plotting and writing. I really did enjoy ‘Gone Girl’, and thought Rosamund Pike was superb as Amy in the movie adaptation, but actually prefer Flynn’s novel ‘Dark Places’ to ‘Gone Girl’ (though all three of her novels are a great read and gripping.)This book was so hard to put down, and I didn't want it to end. For the movie, I can absolutely picture the wonderful Welsh actress Eve Myles in the role of Rachel. Highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a good, gritty, super teeth-crunchy crime book. 'The Girl On The Train' will twist your mind, make you think, try to nut it all out, and mistrust. The characters are flawed, creepy, nuts and I love it. Seems some reviews I've read on GF are negative, they find this kind of book abhorrent, pathetic and the characters horrid - er, they are meant to be! This is real life, this shit DOES happen (horrible, of course, but it does as we see this crap on the News every day) and people DO act in these ways and can be extremely bloody nasty to each other. Life unfortunately is not a sweetshop and unicorns.Anyway, please do yourself a favour and pick up this book right NOW! Looking forward to Paula’s next novel. "
857,Sarah England,"I know it's a bit trashy, and I had guessed the denouement before the end, but suffice to say I stayed up last night to finish it, and have read this in a matter of days whereas my previous book took me weeks. It is superior to 'Gone Girl' in that the characters are at least mostly sympathetic to a degree, whilst I couldn't give a toss about any of the narcissists in 'Gone Girl'. Clever use of layered narrative (hello Wuthering Heights) and its distortion of perception. Definitely would recommend, especially now beach reads are upon us. I defy you not to at least find it intriguing..."
858,Tori,"I listened to the audio recording of this story and loved everything about it: the tale, the characters, the writing, and the astounding performances of the three narrators. Well done!"
859,Masooma,"This novel is a magnetic thriller of two women, interconnected by thin threads of a secret.one for sorrow, two for joy, three for a girl, four for a boy, five for silver, six for gold, seven for a secret never to be told.Rachel is a broken, wretched woman relying solely on alcohol to soothe the violent pangs of her misery but the drinking has left enormous holes in her memory. She is frightened by her own blackouts, unaware of what could have possibly happened last night or the night before that. I can feel the heat come to my face, my stomach a pit of acid. Yesterday- sensible, clearheaded, right-thinking- I decided I must accept that my part in this story was over. But my better angels lost again, defeated by drink, by the person I am when I drink. Drunk Rachel sees no consequences, she is either excessively expansive and optimistic or wrapped up in hate. She has no past, no future. She exists purely in the moment...I want to drag knives over my skin, just so that I can feel something other than shame, but I'm not even brave enough to do that.This time, however, she has to to somehow remember what happened that dreadful Saturday night because there are no reminiscent tid-bits of memory, only some physical evidence. Megan is another sufferer. She's an insomniac frequently suffering from panic attacks and excessive anxiety. Although, apparently she feels happy but she is not bone deep happy. Rather she is not contend with her present life . She is engulfed by a hollowness and a deep sensation of incompleteness....and my brain is going to keep racing round and round and I know I've got a sleepless night coming. I can't just sit here, watching the trains, I'm too jittery, my heartbeat feels like a flutter in my chest, like a bird trying to get out of a cage.The ghosts of the past haunt both these ladies so much so that they find living in the present cumbersome. In their rather unstable frame of minds, they take some preposterous decisions and follow absurd pathways, often whispering of dangers ahead. The story is set in an suburban area of Whitney, the atmosphere of the area with undeveloped aura, passing trains, creaking their way every hour or so adds to the eerie atmosphere and thrill.It is clear that the author knows her subject very well and has taken care of presenting each significant minute detail of her characters. The psychological aspects in the novel are expertly dealt with. What is more is that, she knows exactly where to draw the curtains over which details. The novel is a blast of emotions- shame, guilt, anger, solitude that the reader feels on behalf of the characters but not only these, there is a different set of feelings that one feels for the characters viz; pity, sympathy and fear. All this just proves intimate connection with the characters which is another excellent feature of this novel.The pace is rather exciting. Indubitably, a phenomenal thriller which hooks you from the first page and doesn't let you relax until you've turned the final page and discovered it all.The Girl on the Train deals with how solitude and hollowness can make someone completely deranged and how, under such lonely circumstances, people can be open to/attracted to anyone paying just the mildest bit of attention to them and how faulty can be decisions that such people take. Last but not the least, the writing is superb, a major player in keeping you entangled and lost in the story with the lucid description.I simply loved this novel, in fact, it's the best that I've read in a while. The girl on the train is desolation, abuse, blood, tethering on the edge of insanity, fear and a deep mystery that goes unpredictable, thus enjoyable. I'd recommend it to everybody. Read it."
860,Barbara Copperthwaite,"“Strong storytelling, complex characters, and a psychological depth that makes it exceptionally believable”This is one of those rare crime books: it is one that could easily be read again, because it does not simply rely on the whodunit but on strong storytelling, complex characters, and a psychological depth that makes it exceptionally believable. It is a fascinating journey into the mind of Rachel, someone who is broken and flawed, who cannot trust anything that comes from anyone’s mouth – not even her own.If Rachel sounds awful, she is in good company. The other main narrators, Megan and Anna, aren’t nice either. Megan hides a dark secret, Anna is cold and selfish. In fact, all the characters, the men included, lie, cheat, and manipulate. Yet the author has managed to also make them sympathetic and realistic; at no point do they turn into one-dimensional caricatures.But of all the liars, Rachel is the biggest, unable to trust her own memories as she battles with alcoholism. Even her daily commute on the train is a lie, as she lost her job months before, and travels in to ensure no one realises. It is from her train seat that she bitterly recalls how her life has changed, because each day she passes her old home, where she used to live with her husband, Tom. Now he lives in the same home, with his new wife.A few doors down live a couple, Megan and Scott, who Rachel becomes obsessed with. And that obsession is about to shred her already torn life.As recollections and half-truths slide around Rachel’s mind, as she examines bruises and tries to put together what is happening to her, she is also trying to solve the puzzle of what happened to Megan.This is a skilfully told book, the three women each telling their take on the tale, each one different enough to make it clear that no one is reliable. Everything is constantly shifting, leaving the reader always wondering: just what is the truth?This is a brilliant book, and incredibly complex and assured for a debut novel. Paula Hawkins has a bright future ahead of her."
861,Jim Lyons,"A great summer read - in AprilVery much enjoyed the story as it unfolded, and its narrative approach. A definite page turner that I am sure many will enjoy."
862,Cheri W,"WOW WOW WOW. What just happened?! and omg what a story! If you love a good twisted crime novel, read this book now! I just can't put it down. very very interesting and fast-paced. "
863,Di,I thorougly enjoyed this novel. It started off slow and mainly concentrated on the main character. Gradually other characters were introduced and the novel moved a bit more quickly. The final third gained speed when the central mystery finally started to resolve itself until the very end when I could not stop reading! Sort of like a train. I sort of disliked the main character (alcoholic) but she grew on me. She was realistically portrayed as were the other characters in my opinion. After stating another novel right after this the writing was so awkward compared with Ms. Hawkins. That's when I realized that a good writer makes you forget that you are even reading.
864,Elisha Sherman harksen,"LOVED IT...hoping this novel turns into a film!! If you liked Gone Girl, you will love this book! It's fast paced, mysterious and thrilling! I will definitely read the next book by Paula Hawkins!"
865,Emily Deck,"This was SO GREAT! I can't remember the last time I read a book in a few days. I couldn't put this book down. It was such a page turner that I was half way through the book by the second day. Who can you trust? In this book, I thought I trusted Rachel... She seemed like she had good intentions, but was living a very hard life. She was dealt a really horrible deck of cards, but was trying to get through it with some dignity... minus the alcohol. Anna... well, what can I say. She's every woman's worst nightmare. I hated her in this book. She was such a bitch and reading her parts of the book was the least enjoyable.. at least for me. Megan...I didn't know what the hell was wrong with this girl. She had a very unfortunate life, but she was such a liar that I also had a really hard time liking her. This book was one of those books that I loved, but hated the characters. So... Who done it? Who was the person that made Megan disappear? Lets just say that there was a time where I had thought that every one of the characters had a part in her disappearance. In the beginning, I thought maybe it was Rachel... Then I thought maybe it was Scott or possibly Anna. I couldn't make up my mind on who it could be! Then, there was a certain part in the book in where I knew who it was... I'm not going to say.But, I am going to say that if you were on the fence about buying this book... GET OFF THE FENCE and RUN TO YOUR NEAREST BOOKSTORE! Get your hands on a copy of this book! I promise, you won't be disappointed. Happy Reading! "
866,Cariena,Wow..... 
867,Yera Chez,"I love books that I can't put down! As soon as I finished The Girl on the Train, I messaged my friends and told them to pick it up! I see the Gone Girl comparisons but unlike it, this moves so much faster and it leaves out a big chunk of unnecessary reading. Rachel-the main character, not very likable, even heard myself calling her a Dumb *$@$ at times buttt can you blame the poor lady!? She drinks. And the issues there are real. As much as we want her to stop drinking she knows it won't stop today. Maybe tomorrow. We learn quickly that she's alone. She longs to feel the touch of another person and the only thing close to that are the joys she experiences from riding the TRAIN.The rides give her an inside look at the homes by the railroad...and that's where we meet Jesse & Jason through the perspective of alcoholic Rachel. Until one day it's not Jesse and Jason ...it's Jesse and a new tall, dark, and & handsome man. Rachel feels betrayed, how can she do this!? The feelings in her gut are all too familiar considering that the same thing happened to her. And it just so happens that Tom (ex) and his new wife, Anna live a few houses down. Happily, with their baby girl.Suddenly we find out that Jesse is missing. Jesse is really Meagan. Another lost character that has a void to fill and does it by cheating on her husband, Scott (aka Jason). Rachel, knows she has a lover, and now feels the need to go and tell her husband and the police. Her credibility is not too good considering she's always harassing her ex and his wife. The lies that come pouring out this book are endless. It really goes to show that not everyone is who you think they are.I think what I like the most is that Paula Hawkinscreated characters with such realistic personalities. The women in this book are flawed ...searching and finding themselves in the wrong places. I had my guesses on to what happened to Megan but it was great seeing it develop through the perspectives of Rachel, Anna, & Megan. I'm a fan!"
868,Mandie Kok,"I completely missed the hype on this one. I mean, I knew this was a book that existed, but I didn't know how popular it was. My mother is not a reader AT ALL, I'd say she's read maybe two books in her lifetime, so when she asked me to borrow this book, I couldn't believe it. Unfortunately reading proved too much for her and she was unable to get through it, so I gave it to her in audio format. That was also not enough to keep her from falling asleep, so my mother has never read the book. That meant I had to read it, then tell her the short version.I read the entire book in less than a day. It was utterly engrossing. The characters are completely horrid, yet I found myself intrigued by their stories. Told from multiple characters' perspectives, the mystery slowly reveals itself, with a few unexpected twists and turns.I must admit that usually I am rubbish at guessing who the ""bad guy"" is, but in this tale, I found it rather obvious. It was obvious (view spoiler)[because of the fact that all the characters had massive character flaws, except the one, who appeared downright normal in comparison. You just know he had to have the most skeletons in his closet. (hide spoiler)]As with most mysteries, the story could be summed up in one sentence, which I relayed to my mother, but these types of stories aren't about who done it, it's about how we got there. And this journey was very satisfying. I recommend this book to fans of mystery thrillers."
869,Cosied,Great read from a first-time author. The book has been compared to Gone Girl because it's a thriller about a girl who has gone missing. I liked it better than Gone Girl. Very satisfying until the very end. Looking forward to her next book.
870,Carolynne,"WOW. Could not put it down. Stayed up WAY too late to finish this book. I can see why the library's waiting list for this book was so long! Well worth the wait.Hawkins drew a well-crafted thriller and at the same time, drew non-judgmental attention to the issues of substance abuse and domestic violence. Telling two (and later, three) parallel stories of women's lives and their relations to the men around them, and how Rachel, Megan, and Anna deal with love and loss. Can't wait to see what else Paula Hawkins has written."
871,LeAnne Franke,"I haven't read a book this deliciously fun in a long time! The story itself is interesting and kept me wanting more, but what really hooked me was the excellent characterization of the three lead characters (all women, btw). All three women are seriously flawed, their unreliable narration colored by personal bias and profound emotions. The writing style changes beautifully with each perspective switch, and this adds another layer of doubt for you the reader trying to sift through an already complex and suspenseful story. The tension is just right, each scene revealing just enough to tease you into reading the next chapter, and then the next, until the novels heart-pounding, well-earned and well-crafted ending. Wonderfully written, fun to read and kept my attention the entire way through. I gobbled this one down in a day, I hope to read more from this author if her next books are anything like this one!"
872,Heather Balog,"I kept hearing about this book, how it was being compared to Gone Girl. This was no Gone Girl. This was Agatha Christie on crack. I literally could not put this book down until I finished it. Did I have an inkling of the ending? Sure I did, but only because this book is so similar in Christie's formula. But it's different, oh so different. The three different story lines converging is entertaining and just enough to throw the reader off the scent. Or just to question it enough. Is Rachel really crazy? Or is everyone else deceitful? Awesome book. Do yourself a favor and read this one. "
873,Angie Lopez,Loved this book! I couldn't put it down and it had me guessing right up to the very end! I see the parallels with Gone Girl BUT don't let that stop you from endulging in this great read!
874,Craig Allen,"AMAZING!!!! This seems to be the book everyone is talking about these days and it was even better than the hype made it out to be, IMO. Rachel and Megan, the definition of unreliable narrators, alternate telling their story of how things are never what they appear to be from the outside looking in. A great book full of secrets, lies, twists, turns, lust, and even some humor thrown in. Kept me guessing (I had about 8 theories going at once)--I can't recommend this one enough. A+++++++++++++++++!!!!!!"
875,Laura Brill,"If you liked Gone Girl, you will love this book!This story starts out with a lonely, troubled woman who is riding the train into London every day. We gradually discover why she's doing this, what her situation is, and then the really interesting things start to happen as she observes different people in their homes each day, and what is happening in those homes that she can see into as the train slows and stops on its way into London and on its way back to her home each day.This is a story of mistaken assumptions, characters who trust the wrong people, and lie to themselves and others. The plot turns in very interesting directions with the tension and suspense gradually escalating through 2/3 of the book, and very quickly escalating in the final 1/3. At then end of the book, you realize how easy it is to judge people by only the limited facts you know about them."
876,Sarah,"Incredible book! Never have I read a novel where I failed to like a single character, it was so refreshing. When I first began reading the girl on the train I wasn't sure what I was reading to begin with, I had heard so much about this book that I was unsure with what I was given when I began to read. This was soon washed away as the plot started to unravel and all the core characters came into play. It is clear Rachel is a tragic and lost character, who through her obsession for a child has torn her own life apart. The great thing about this character is although she is aware of this she stills holds hope that she can recover what she lost with Tom. The fact you can empathise for her but also get really annoyed at her behaviour and inability to stop drinking is a true show of the authors skill as a writer.You want her to move on, rebuild her life and forget the past but the fact she cannot do that shows a very human quality that allows the reader to build a strange relationship with Rachel, it also helps you establish her point of view to cloud your opinion of other characters such as Tom and Anna. The fact that the narrative is split between the key antagonists of the story is also what makes this such a great read. The author has allowed you to see the story through several pairs of eyes to build a more rounded picture of Rachel, her relationship with others but also you get inside the thoughts of the characters themselves which gives the story a more gritty appeal.Although I saw a potential twist that I managed to guess before it happened, it still added to the shock and dislike of Tom as well as every other character. This is not something I have com across before, it is brave as people are so used to having a nice(ish) narrator that they can relate to and cheer on, but everyone in this has done something awful and are basically just not nice (or more realistically human when put to the test)I would recommend this book to anyone as it is something that stands alone in its agenda to be what it is and doesn't set out to make heroes and villains, just to show a very human and tragic story. It is a book I could read a thousand times."
877,Diana Pardee,"This psychological thriller started out slowly, building layers of personalities, neuroses and lies until the climax knocked me out of my seat. For the last three hours, I curled up in my comfy armchair and didn't budge until I was finished... then wished it hadn't ended so soon.Kudos to first time author, Paula Hawkins for one of the most compelling reads I've enjoyed this year!"
878,Didi,"Utterly fantastic. This book was incredible. When I read books like this I think, I REALLY need to expand out of just romance. I just finished and my head is swimming with everything I read. Brilliant narration, complex characters, some of whom I hated and loathed, a tight and compelling plot and wonderful pacing. This was a fantastically suspenseful, psychological thrill ride. From the first page I couldn't put it down. Every time I thought I figured something out my theory was trashed. It wasn't until the last third where I really put my mind into gear, desperate to gleam something, anything before all was revealed. At that point I had my suspicions, mainly because everything else was foiled! Many compare this to Gone Girl, and yes, I see the similarity. But this was much better. Very different too, and needs merit all on its own. This was taught with nail-biting adrenaline and build up. I loved it. I felt so sorry for Rachel while at the same time begging her to get it together. It's amazing how little you really know about people, how much they could surprise you with the depth of their depravity. Go into this blind. Don't do your homework, don't ask around. JUST READ THIS. When it ended I felt gutted, in a good way but also in a, wow...that was intense, way. I couldn't believe this was a debut. Anyways, bloody brilliant and highly recommended."
879,Allison,"I don't know why there are so many negative reviews of this book! I consider myself a pretty discerning reader (admittedly quite inexperienced with thrillers) but I thought this one was awesome! The story pulled me right in, and kept me there. Other reviewers complained about unlikeable characters, but while sure, there's some nastiness, I never felt repulsed by them personally (actions, of course, but not THEM). I liked the book! Five stars! I read it immediately after Gone Girl because there was so much comparison. In my view, this one is MILES ahead of Gone Girl, which I thought was boring, dumb and absolutely full of uninteresting, unlikeable characters. There's barely a comparison to be made -- this one is far, far better. Read this, and skip Gone Girl!"
880,Kirstie,Loved this and devoured it in three sitting - would have been one of I didn't have a toddler 
881,Keri,"If you like books with positive, uplifting messages and characters you can root for, pass on this book: you're not going to like it. If, on the other hand you like twisted, complicated characters and stories, like I do, you just might like this book."
882,Kater Cheek,"This is the second book I've read that's been described as being similar to GONE GIRL, but this one actually comes pretty close. It starts with Rachel Watson, an unemployed alcoholic who is maintaining the illusion of a normal life by continuing to commute daily to London. Every day she looks at the perfect couple in their perfect little house, just a few houses down from where Rachel once shared her own perfect life with Tom.Except none of them are perfect. Tom cheated on Rachel with Anna, and is now married to her. The perfect ""Jess"" cheats on ""Jason"" her husband, and it turns out not only is she not Jess (she's Meg) but ""Jason"" (Scott) may have murdered her.Rachel does a lot of horrible things, partly because of her alcoholism and partly because of her inability to get over Anna destroying Rachel's marriage to Tom. She can't stop calling Tom, and the only thing that seems to let her break away from her sad story is the idea that she might be able to help find Meg's real killer.Rachel gets further involved with Tom and Anna, gets involved with Scott, and even gets involved with Meg (the dead girl)'s therapist. She vacillates between pathetic and sympathy-inducing as she tries, and fails, and tries again to sort her life out.I got the audiobook, narrated by three different women. The actress who does Rachel is good, but the actress who does Meg has the most beautiful voice I've ever heard, especially when she does the Bosnian accent of Kumar Abditch. Chapters alternate between the three women, unfolding the story of what happened with great pacing.This novel has everything I could hope for in a psychological thriller, and even though it's only January, I wouldn't be surprised if it was my favorite book all year."
883,David Harris,"I am grateful to the publisher for sending me an advance copy of this book. It is though going to be tricky to review - much of the information is hinted at, inferred and only emerges after a degree of teasing. There’s a lot of potential for spoilers.If, like me, you commute by train I'm sure you will have gazed out of the carriage window into the back gardens of houses beside the line. Often, the track is raised up, and you can see right into the garden, or even the house. Though people are protective of their privacy at the front, nobody seems to realise just how much you can see from the train - the weed choked gardens, of course, the neat gardens, those with trampolines and sandpits... the house with a pair of deck chairs on a flat roof, the bike stored on a fire escape, posters in the bedrooms… what Hawkins has done is to imagine how much you might see if you really looked, if you saw the people as well (which, to be honest, you generally don't at eight in the morning, as they're probably also on their way to work too).That idea of peering into someone else’s life is very powerful. But of course lives seen like could be very deceptive.Rachel travels into London every day, looking out of the window, observing the gardens, the couple she calls ""Jason"" and ""Jess"", weaving happy little daydreams about them. We sense something a little strange about Rachel: but what it is, the book only reveals slowly. Likewise, only gradually do we learn why she is paying such close attention as the train passes that particular row of housesHawkins shows great delicacy and skill as she hints at Rachel's problems. The focus is on the situation she's looking into, not on her. But drawn into that situation she is: there are natural comparisons with Hitchcock, perhaps. ""Stranger on a train seeing what she takes to be evidence of a crime"" is an obvious one, but there are others, too (spoilers!) as the book digs deeper into the relationships between the various couples who live beside the railway track.I loved the way here that Hawkins makes it oh so plausible for Rachel to be trying to find out about what has happened. She comes to believe she is involved, and that only by filling gaps in her own past (if there are gaps) will she solve the crime (if there was a crime) and only by solving the crime will she fill those gaps. So far, so logical, but Rachel is damaged, blundering, both a threat (so some) and, perhaps, herself in danger. While she is not immediately sympathetic, Rachel is a complex and engaging character who wins over the reader, especially as it becomes clearer what has happened to her. By the end I guarantee you'll be cheering on (though perhaps cringing at what she may do next).It is an absorbing read, perhaps a little slow to get moving - but if you commute regularly you'll be used to sitting waiting. It's all part of the journey, and can be put to good use. I once lived in a house by the railway, in a town an hour from London. We could hear the station announcements from our back garden. We could see the garden from the train, just for a moment. I don't travel that way now but sometimes I take the train from Paddington and I spot that garden, wonder who lives there now, are they happy… perhaps I should take that train more often, and watch more closely, get to know them better..."
884,Kristin Yeager,"The Girl on the Train is suspenseful, gripping, and provocative in all the right ways. I read this book in six hours. Hawkins' portrayal of the stark truth that the people in our lives we feel the closest to and think we know so well are often no different than passing strangers is both captivating and disturbing. Her gritty and thoughtful representation of depression and addiction is compelling.Tom and Rachel are a seemingly happy couple that eventually become plagued with the crushing realities of infertility. As a result, Rachel spirals into alcoholism and Tom finds solace with another woman. Flash forward and Tom is now a happy husband to Anna, the woman he left Rachel for, and a father living out his life in the house him and Rachel bought together but she left when their relationship went sour. As a result of her alcoholism, Rachel loses her job but must keep up what little facade she can to placate her flatmate and convince her to allow Rachel to continue to share her apartment. Rachel takes the train to and from London at work hours everyday to ease any suspicions that she may be unemployed. Unfortunately, this train ride takes her by her old home, the now happy haven of Tom and Anna and everyday she's reminded of her failures and her loss. As a distraction to this sad reality, Rachel becomes fixated on the couple three houses down. A couple she affectionately refers to as Jess and Jason but later learns are Megan and Scott. In Rachel's mind, Jess and Jason appear to be the perfect couple, passionately in love with bright futures as a doctor and fashion designer. In reality, Megan and Scott are facing a growing distance from one another, Scott always at work as an IT consultant and Megan constantly imagining a different life for herself after the failure of her dream art gallery. This reality comes as a slap in the face for Rachel when one morning, from the train, she witnesses Megan kissing another man on their back patio. The next day, Megan is missing and presumed dead. From here, the reader embarks on a suspenseful journey along side Rachel to expose Megan's killer and reveal the dark truth about the people she imagined she knew so well. Hawkins skillfully weaves Rachel's addiction throughout this piece and has the reader rooting for her to find sobriety and get to the bottom of what happened the night Megan disappeared. The cons I found with this book are so few and more due to personal preference and gratification, I don't feel they're even worth noting here. Enjoy this book for what it is, a page turning, suspenseful murder mystery that will have you on the edge of your seat eager for answers. "
885,Rawan Alherz,THIS BOOK IS SO DAMN GOOD I MEAN OH MY GOD LOVED IT 
886,Jenny Cohen,Un muy buen thriller . De esos libros que te dejan picada y no puedes parar de leer. No es de esos libros que te dejan algo que aprender solo un libro que no quieres dejar de leer para ver que pasa al final. Si me gusto mucho porque a mi si me gustan los thrillers como estos jajaja.
887,Celeste,"Great thriller, fast paced, in depth character development. Reminds me of Gone Girl. Read it in two days. Very enjoyable!"
888,Jessica Russell,"It's been a while since a book sucked me in right from the beginning, and this one really did. I really enjoyed reading it and couldn't wait to pick it up again when I had to put it down. "
889,Ashanti,I LOVED this book!!! Every time a new book is compared to “Gone Girl” I end up being disappointed. “The Girl on the Train” lived up to the hype. This book was exciting and suspenseful. All of the twists and turns made it impossible to guess the ending. I would definitely recommend this book. 
890,Audrey,"J'ai adoré l'intrigue, le livre est très prenant ! A lire absolument !!"
891,Leora Williams,Hard to put down; wanted to get to the end. 
892,Jessica Coughlin,"Hells yes! This is my kind of book! I suspected everyone but the actual killer. I even suspected maybe Megan ran off for some time. Basically, I thought everyone was potential but the actual killer. I also really related to the main three girls in some way. It was raw and real and suspenseful, and just great all around. I have nothing negative to say about it. Such a great murder mystery!"
893,beloved books by Tine,Meine Rezension:http://lovelybooksbytine.blogspot.de/...
894,Wes,"A fantastic thriller, moves at a keen pace, believable characters and what a good thriller should do is keep you guessing right to the end. If you haven't already read it it's well worth it highly recommended."
895,Stephen,"A very good vacation read. In fact, I was always racing back to my beach chair just so I could get that girl off the damn train! Throw in lots of drinking, infidelity, violence and a few train rides and you've got an action-packed suspenseful thriller that I think has a good chance of getting made into a movie. Many are calling it the British version of ""Gone Girl"" since the story is told in first person from the perspective of the three main women in the story, and since there is some suspense when one of the girls (as seen from the train) goes missing."
896,Ari Preston,"One of the best books that I've read in quite some time! The storyline and characters were top notch. Overall, I enjoyed this book more than Gone Girl...especially the ending."
897,Tess,"I loved this book! I was hooked from start to finish. I love myself some ""unreliable narrator"" and this book had some to spare!I liked the main character Rachel alot. I really felt for her and wanted her to pull through. I loved how they used her blackouts to create tension and obscure the truth. I loved how the view points would switch so that you could relate a little to all the women in the story.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone that likes a murder mystery or likes unreliable narrators or to just anyone in general!

898,Tanya Nekrasova,"Я жертва рекламы, даже не буду пытаться говорить, что шум вокруг это книги не коснулся меня и руки не чесались ее прочитать. Хотелось и чесалось, я долго ходила кругами еще вокруг электронки на инглише, но не решалась браться за книгу. А тут уже и русских перевод подоспел, еще один знак, что надо читать. Но в последнее время книг с надписью ""MUST READ"" в России стало выходить много и на всех времени и сил не хватает. Так что ""Девушка"" могла бы пролежать еще бы не один год, если бы не другой книголюб, который подтолкнул меня к нее прочтению, за что ему спасибо. «Она похоронена под серебристой березкой рядом со старыми железнодорожными путями. Могила»… Так зловеще начинается история девушка по имени Рейчел, которая ежедневно проделывает путь из небольшого городка Эшбери до Лондона, притворяясь, что едет на работу и потягивает горячительные напитки, глуша душевные раны. Коротко, Рейчел - разведенная, безработная алкоголичка. Она в глубокой яме и выбирать из этой самой ямы у нее нет никакого желания. Коротает свои часы Рейчел прогулками по Лондону и подглядываем пары, которая живет в доме, рядом с путями. Она зовет их Джесс и Джейсона и выдумает целые истории об них, наблюдая за ними через окно электрички. Они воплощение семейной идиллии – молодые, красивые, влюбленные. «Они то, что я потеряла, они являются всем, чем мне хочется быть».И вся каша начинается однажды, когда проезжая мимо их дома, в окне поезда Рейчел замечает, что на террасе рядом с Джесс, не Джейсон, а другой мужчина, которого Джесс страстно целует и через несколько дней в новостях сообщают, что Джесс бесследно исчезла…Безумная книга. Безумные герои. Безумные повороты событий. Пробрало до мурашек. Я чертыхалась, злилась, мне хотелось дать Рейчел пару оплеух и сказать «соберись тряпка»…. В общем, эмоции били ключом. А это я люблю. Советую всем (кроме особо нервных xDDD). Оценка 10 и 5"
899,Bianca,"Review posted first on my blog.I finished this book yesterday, and afterwards I sat in silence, stumped for a good five minutes. It was a thrilling whirlwind of emotions, confusion and anticipation. I had absolutely no idea what to expect--I heard it referred to as ""the next Gone Girl,"" but that was about it. It also just came out in January this year and it's so talked about that I finally had to throw aside the rest of the books that were next on my list and dive into The Girl on the Train.And I'm so glad I did. The story is gripping and riveting. The narrative switches from the point of view of three very different but equally disturbed women, and Hawkins does a great job distinguishing between their voices. I was concerned at first that I was going to get lost in who was who, but I never had that problem. It flowed smoothly and effortlessly between narrators and periods of time.I came across a few other reviews stating that they guessed exactly what happened, but I honestly had no idea. It was completely unpredictable and kept me guessing the whole way through. "
900,Michal,"Heard this through audio-book. Both a good fast-paced read/listen and very well done with three different readers doing the 3 women who alternate in narration in the first person. The readers have a good range of English accents so you really feel you're in that space. I highly recommend. As for being better than Gone Girl, this is up there with that book, and both are a mystery, but it's a totally opposite type of imperfect protagonist than ""Amazing Amy"" who is so in control, while (and I'm not giving anything away) Rachel is an alcoholic wreck struggling to maintain her sanity while everything is spinning out of control and everyone is turning against her. "
901,Marge Mclaughlin,Enjoyed this novel from the first sentence to the last. Absolutely engaging.
902,Cristina Oliveras,I haven't read a book that fast in awhile. But I couldn't put it down. Each chapter that ended kept you guessing. The points of views kept changing but they were easy to follow and things weren't too obvious to figure out. The book started off interesting and ended great. I recommend! 
903,Rebecca Ann,"It took me 25% of this book to warm up to it but when it clicked I became obsessed. The very best part of the story is how deeply flawed and complex the characters are. I don't want to be friends with any of them but I loved trying to decide who was ""bad"". Rachel in particular was detestable to me at first and through much of the book. I was so convinced of her guilt that when other plots began to unwind it was like a slap of cold water to the face. Sociopaths aplenty. "
904,Under Milkwood,"Although this book is nothing like ""Gone Girl"", it appeared on the shelves at an appropriate time, just as the film of the said book was inspiring heated dinner table conversations.Paula Hawkins novel can only be described as a 'ripper of a page turner'. Sure, there's a few implausibilities throughout, but name a thriller that doesn't have at least a few. Without giving anything a way, the book features three narrators via virtual diary entries and there's minimal time shifts. It may sound complicated but its actually brilliant in its simplicity.There's a disappearance, a murder and a whole lot of time spent travelling on an outer London train - observing the world outside the carriage. I was seriously sucked in by this book, and as Paul Simon once said -""Everybody loves the sound of a train in the distance."""
905,Thelastwordreview,"Paula Hawkins debut novel is the ultimate psychological thriller that will keep your pulses racing until the very last page.The story is narrated through the eyes and pen of Rachel a lonely somewhat miserable young woman who drinks a lot, let’s face it Rachel is an alcoholic. Every morning she commutes by train to London to work, there is also a fantasy going on here as she see the same couple every day from the window of her carriage and creates a fantasy world for this couple. What we then realise here is that the sub plot is that this couple live just a few doors away from Rachel’s ex-husband Tom and his new wife Anna. The narration from Rachel is something that makes The Girl on the Train something very special and incredibly insightful from a woman whose life really has come off the rails. Through the narration you begin to understand how Rachel lives a life through a glass and if often so drunk she has no memory of what has happened in her life. She has had a drink problem for quite some time and the fact that she lost her job because of it adds to the mystery of her daily train journeys into London.Many reviews I have read of Paula Hawkins debut novel said they could not show any empathy with Rachel, yet I totally became involved with her and she stands out to me more so than any of the other lead characters, yet I am not entirely sure why, I put this down to the incredible skill of Hawkins writing and how she has portrayed Rachel. When Megan goes missing Rachel believes she holds vital information as what happened, but alas Rachel’s memory is vague to say the least and struggles to recall exact details and the frustration that bubbles to the surface in this taught thriller. Add to this that Rachel continues to harass her ex-husband, lies and is viewed with incredible amount of suspicion by those around her. Rachel decides to take it upon herself to get involved in the investigation into the disappearance of Megan and also those very close to the investigation. There is a real twist to the end of the story that will keep you gripped until the very last moments as Rachel finally recalls some detail from one of her previous blackouts. There is so much more to The Girl on the Train that it is at times completely unpredictable a clever and refreshingly brilliant thriller.With the huge success of Gillian Flynn’s Gone Girl still very much fresh in our minds, 2015 has seen some brilliant thrillers based around poisonous relationships but without a shadow of doubt The Girl on the Train is the runaway success of the year and a global smash hit and with a film now due to hit the screens late 2016 staring Emily Blunt in the lead role will surely be just as successful on the screen as the book has been through 2015.If you have been living anywhere other than this planet and you have not yet experienced The Girl on the Train, make this a Christmas book choice to curl up with over the holidays and experience what the rest of the World has in this roller-coaster of a modern psychological thriller. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
906,Susan Crowe,"Will be out January 13, 2015. READ THIS BOOK!!!!"
907,Sarah Brennan,"I have read Gone Girl and whilst these two books are compared, I enjoyed Girl on the Train so much more. The book kept me reading into the wee hours and that is rare. I really enjoyed the flawed characters and the anti hero. You struggle to like anyone in this book, but at the same time the flaws and the characteristics you despise, you find yourself thinking ""so I am not the only one who thinks that"". As a debut novel I thought this book was great and would highly recommend it....better than Gone Girl"
908,Saat Omar,Hard to put down. I mean it. U want to continue reading and reading and finish it in one sitting. Believe the hype.
909,Gillian,"I loved this book. The narrative structure, with its disrupted timeline, and the characterization, which is accomplished through a pattern of small revelations kept me reading all night long. Rachel is a fascinating, complex character with flaws, fears, and fantasies. Highly recommended for readers who enjoyed thrillers like Gone Girl, Before I Go to Sleep, or Reconstructing Amelia."
910,Normandie Alleman,I enjoyed this book. The audiobook performance was wonderful!
911,Jamie Puleo,"YES! Finally a book that I was dying to finish! There are so many comparisons to Gone Girl, but honestly, I didn't see it. Both psychological thrillers? OK, but that was about it. This book completely stands alone on its' own merits. I couldn't wait to see how this one ended and at one point or another, I thought all of the characters were suspects. Great read and so much more satisfying than that other book that everyone else seems to love!"
912,Κατερίνα,"Although I had guessed who the killer was from halfway through, my interest didn't diminish till the last page. It was a compulsive read and I finished the book in less than 24 hours, neglecting chores, forgetting everything until I was done. The characters were well drawn (Rachel and Megan, especially) and the revelations of the various backstories well paced and masterfully done."
913,Denise,"I was given this book by a friend and looked at it very uninterested. I am used to being given books by people about things I am not interested in because ""I enjoy reading so much"". Long story short I picked it up yesterday and didn't sleep until I read every page. I loved every word, I was so into the book. The thought of it ending actually mad me sad. It has been a really long time since a read a book this gripping. This author is amazing. The characters felt real to me. She didn't try so hard like most authors to make them perfect and over sell them. I questioned each character and formed a love/ hate relationship towards each one of them. She made me understand addictive in a way I didn't think is possible. I loathe addicts (strong words I know but we all walk a different part in life). I would only give this book to people that appreciate and take pleasure in the joys of reading. "
914,JoLene,"Have you ever played the game of looking at someone (or couples) and making up a story about their life. Rachel Watson, who takes the train daily to her job, does this; however, when she sees something that doesn't fit in with her version of the truth, it sets off a series of events that leaves the reader wondering who are the good guys and the bad guys in this story.I really enjoyed this book, but don't want to give away any of the plot points as that is part of the fun. I thought that Hawkins did a brilliant job of showing how everything is not as it seems by using three different narrators with slightly different timelines. Rachel is definitely a flawed character, who you simultaneously feel sorry for and turned off by her behavior. As a debut novel, I think Hawkins hit it out of the park. "
915,Emma Browning,"This book was definitely a page turner. Like some others have mentioned, I did click with who was to blame pretty early on compared to most thrillers, but for me this didn't spoil it... It simply added to that suspense of how it was all going to end, the sense of oncoming dread... The reason I've given 5 stars is mainly because of the characters. The emotional journeys which you observe them going through are completely believable and it reminds us of the hidden stories that hide behind everyone's 'normal' appearances..."
916,Allen,2016 starts off with a page turning thriller about a woman dealing with her broken marriage and a drinking problem who becomes involved in the disappearance of another woman who lived on the same street that the she used to live on. 
917,For the Love of Books & Alcohol Blog,"


“In the morning, I take the 8:04, and in the evening, I come back on the 5:56. That’s my train. It’s the one I take. That’s the way it is.”
Sheer brilliance. That’s what this book is. I am in awe.I had the great honor of meeting the author, Paula Hawkins, a couple of months ago. Naturally, I was excited to read Rachel’s story after listening to her discuss this book and the voyage that led to it. Nothing, I mean nothing could have prepared me for what I just read.I think Rachel is one of the most interesting and complex characters I have come across in some time. She is just a woman like any other. Sad, downtrodden and defeated by the everyday cruelties of life, but a woman nonetheless. A bit pathetic and definitely lonely, she spends entirely too much time in her head. As we are introduced to Rachel and her current state, it is painfully clear that this poor thing is about to take us on a harrowing journey.One of the things that make this book so remarkable is that each character has great depth. They all have a story. As their truths are exposed, you become more and more entrenched in the story. This plot was more realistic than I think we want to acknowledge. Knowing that there are people out there who are this sad and desperate… and common. It makes me look at everyone I see a little differently.The settings for most of the book are almost claustrophobic. There is a stifling sense of dreariness throughout the story. I loved the moments when Rachel was on the train. I loved the symbolism. We heard this story from multiple points of view. This added another layer of profundity to the mystery.In the end, there is a mystery to be solved. The character development and the world building is so fascinating that one might forget that if the writing wasn't so brilliant. So the mystery… I had no idea who was guilty. I really didn't. I went back and forth several times suspecting each and every one of them. But what it came down to is that you were not going to know until the author was good and ready to tell you. And when the killer was revealed? WOW. Just Wow.Even after the mystery is answered this book held me for just a few more pages and offered a couple more twists. I actually smiled at the wickedness of the revelations.6 stars and a gin & tonic for this dazzling book! Here’s to many more to come!

"
918,Kristin Anderson,"Brilliant. I had so much fun with this book, and I'm sure I won't be forgetting it anytime soon "
919,Kristine Walker,"It's easy to see why one critic compared this novel to 'Hitchcock.' Written in what has become a popular format, the story is told from the points of view of three different women: Megan, Rachel, and Anna. Rachel is the protagonist, the 'girl on the train', and the ex-wife of Tom, with whom she seems obsessed. We are told of her obsession riding the train so that she can peer into the backyard of her old house and those of her former neighbours. She sees Anna, Tom's pretty new wife, from her vantage point of the train. One day her former neighbour, Megan, goes missing, and the remainder of the novel is Rachel's search for the truth of what happened the night she got off the train, the same night Megan disappeared. Is Rachel herself somehow involved? What did she see? Because of her wine-soaked memory blackouts, she has no recollection of that night, only that she was near the station and was seen by a 'red-haired man' with whom she later meets to obtain an account of her actions. Is he involved in Megan's disappearance? Is Scott, Megan's husband, a killer? Or was her therapist, with whom she was having an affair, responsible for her disappearance? It's a cliche to say it, but this novel really is a 'page-turner' and our suspense to find Megan's killer is matched by our concern for Rachel herself, our unreliable narrator, whose life, due to excessive drinking, is out of control as we see her shunned by nearly all those who know her. As she tries desperately to puzzle together Megan's disappearance and her own possible involvement in it, we see her climb in and out of an alcoholic stupor that gets in the way of her ability to find meaning and stability as well as her attempt to help solve a mystery she may have done more than just witness. A great read."
920,Maprang,"It's bound to be compared to Gone Girl. I like both. They are different, despite the missing girl and the infidelity themes. The Girl on the Train is more addictive. I finished it in less than a week, which is a record time for me. All the twists. the interwoven tales, the frequent lines that demand you to stop and think ""wow, this is great stuff"", they make up for a true page-turner. I can't remember the last time I felt this challenged, like trying to solve a puzzle or a math question, only with this one you feel very emotionally-involved. In that sense, I like it more than Gone Girl.But I knew there was something off. I knew when I was about 90% done with the book. I couldn't make it out at first. But just now, 2 days later, I can. It's the not-so-surprising quality of the answer. In Gone Girl, you are left with awe and admiration and fright for Amy. She herself is complex. In The Girl on the Train, the story is complex, while the revelation simply ends the whole thing. The villian is boring. When I think back to the book after finishing it, I think about Rachel and her accurate portrayal of depression and addiction. I don't really care too much for the ending."
921,Patricia,this was a really good book to read. I couldn't put it down. I love the flow of the story. I felt sympathy for the main character Rachel and was proud of the way she took charge in the end. I didn't care for the two main men in the book but I think we are not suppose to like them. They were both controlling and arrogant. I felt for the other two female characters but I didn't really like Anna. I thought she was cold and self centered but again I think that is how we are suppose to feel for her. I felt sorry for Megan although I think she brought on most of her issues by making bad choices throughout her life. I think she realizes that too. I love the twists and turns through out the story that either make you change your mined on the villain several times or totally confuse you. I usually figure things out with the first 100 pages but not in this book it took me quite a while to put it together but I wasn't sure how it would end. I usually find the ending or the revealing of the bad guy anticlimactic but this time I wasn't disappointed. I found it to be interesting and pretty much on the edge of my chair kind of thing. I really liked this book. A must read. 
922,Lizziespringer,I couldn't put this book down. I was actually reading it while standing in my kitchen trying to cook at the same time.
923,Melissa Heerboth,"I can honestly say there are very few books where I can’t figure out what’s going to happen very early on. I couldn’t put done the book because I had to know who killed Megan! Literally I forgot I was cooking dinner and almost caught my kitchen on fire --- never has a book had me come close to that. LolAnyhow Rachel, The Girl on the Train, is a drunk. We’re talking black out can’t remember anything total mess. She watches this couple every day while she’s on the train (going to her “fake” job, a job she lost but is embarrassed to tell her flatmate). She thinks this couple have the perfect marriage and she fantasies about it and how they must be like. Wow, was she way off on that one! One day she see another man kissing Megan and then one day Megan goes missing. Now she knows she witnesses something that happened the day Megan went missing (of course she was drunk and trying to get to see her cheating ex-husband who just happens to live on Megan’s street); however, she can’t remember what happened. She afraid, bleeding, has a cut on her head and she can’t remember anything that happened. She gets involved in the case and desperately wants to figure out what she can’t remember. There’s murder, black outs, secrets, lies, infidelity, public drunkenness, you name it, it’s in here. It’s a great book and like I said, I can usually figures things out very quickly but, this book was close to the end when you figure it out. And remember, you can think other peoples lives are perfect and make up fantasies in your head and live them out in your mind but, it’s usually way off from what you believed. Happy reading!"
924,Debora,"A page-turner! Reminds me a lot of ""Gone Girl"" by Gillian Flynn. "
925,Alice Harbin,"It was a great mystery and it really told the sad tale of an alcoholics life; even the little known fact that when an alcoholic stops drinking, that when they take the next drink, no matter how much later, they become drunk just as quickly if not quicker than before they had quit. Their tolerance to alcohol is less, not greater. Then too the alcoholic blackout is described well. The arrangement of the chapters by character and dates made it a frustrating read; I had to look back often to determine where I was on the time line. "
926,KBev,Fantastic book with unreliable narrators. Really great story in the vein of Gone Girl. Highly recommended. 
927,Linnéa Söderberg,I am.. Completely startled. I have no idea where to begin or even.. Wow. Definitely worth reading.
928,Mary (scarletbloom),"Мне кажется, сравнения с ""Исчезнувшей"" Флинн, конечно, идут на пользу маркетингу, но при этом очень вредят восприятию самой книги. Потому что история, рассказанная Хокинс совершенно иная. Перед нами мозаика, созданная трями абсолютно разными женщинами. У них разное происхождение, устремления и восприятие жизни. Но при этом в них есть нечто неуловимо общее. Книга Хопкинс не столько детектив, в конце концов, довольно быстро становится понятно, кто совершил преступление, да и мотивы поступка преступника, сколько размышления о природе человека и силе творимых им иллюзий, в которые он сам же потом начинает искренне верить. Интересен взгляд на появление невольных соглядатаев и тихих свидетелей нашей жизни, которые незаметны для нас и у которых мы находимся под наблюдением, пусть и на краткий период времени. Рейчел, главная героиня, переживает крах во всех сферах жизни. Сначала проблемы с деторождением, а потом и с алкоголем приводят к тому, что она теряет всё: работу, мужа и, наконец, себя. Она прекрасно осознаёт свои поступки, понимает, что так дальше жить нельзя, понимает последствия и всё равно ничего не может сделать. Единственное, что невозможно сказать - когда была пройдена точка невозврата и началось это саморазрушение, когда была преодолена эта скользкая грань. Поэтому неудивительно, что Рейчел в попытке уйти от реальности начинает подглядывать за чужой жизнью и фантазировать на тему своих знакомых незнакомцев, наделяя их всем, чего сама лишена в настоящий момент. Как итог - построение иллюзорного мира, который при первом же столкновении с реальностью, оказался жестоко разрушен. Анна, нынешняя жена бывшего мужа Рейчел. Не удалось мне ей ни симпатизировать, ни сочувствовать. Понимаю её видение Рейчел, но то, как она вела себя в финале и мотивы, которые ею двигали, вызывают чувство омерзения по отношению к ней. Всё ради счастливой картинки. Меган. Как говорится, не родись красивой, а родись счастливой. У неё получилось первое и не вышло со вторым.Отлчиная книга и шикарный психологический триллер "
929,Marta Sande,Genial
930,Klaasje,"Heerlijk boek, jammer dat ik het uit heb! Halverwege had ik het idee dat de schrijver een beetje te lang doorging op de leegte en het drankgebruik van de hoofdpersoon maar op het moment dat ik dat dacht kwam er ook meteen weer een mooie wending in het verhaal: vergeven en vergeten dus. Niet voorspelbaar, leuke invalshoek en het feit dat je bepaalde zaken en dagen vanuit een andere persoon zijn perspectief leest was voor mij weer even een goede reminder dat De Waarheid een relatief begrip is. Rachel, Anna, Megan, Scott, Tom en natuurlijk ""Jess"" en ""Jason""...ze zijn je tijd waard. Een detective maar dan net een beetje anders."
931,Camie,"This book has three narrators Anna, Megan, and most importantly Rachel , who IS the girl on the train, an unemployed alcoholic who rides the commuter train carefully observing and fantasizing about what is going on in a neighborhood she passes twice daily, and whose ""blackouts"" further the mystery and glimpses of memory serve as clues to solve a devious crime in this new highly acclaimed psychological thriller about trust and betrayal. Very suspenseful and hard to put down . 5 stars"
932,Carolyn,"Wow, that was a page-turner! And set in a London suburb? Yes, please!"
933,Sarju Shrestha Marzullo,What an amazing read. A page turner. The story about an alcoholic woman who was recently divorced and staying with a friend in a tiny apartment gets tangled with a case of a disappearing person. Her intention to help effects everyone in her life. Paula Hawkins did an amazing job in this psychological thriller telling stories from 3 main characters going back and forth. The simply written language but each chapter leaves you with a question of what is going to happen next. love it!!! I finished the book in one day. I could not put it down.
934,Stephanie Garcia,"A book worth all the hype The Girl on the Train is the debut novel of Paula Hawkins. ( particularly excellent for a debut) Psychological thrillers are one of my favourite genre of novels and I must say i was in awe with this nail biting mystery. They said it was similar to Gone Girl but for me they are entirely different. “There’s nothing so painful, so corrosive, as suspicion.”The multiple points of view of the 3 women made the story bigger and richer. In the beginning I am lost, but really, each time I think I've figured out who murdered and then suddenly...I'm wrong! The twists and turns kept me guessing all over the place, until the very end. It was packed with confusion and doubt. The plot was compelling and brilliant, it has strange characters added to keep it exciting and intense.  This book made me go mind f*cking crazy and i super loved it. Recommend this to all the readers who love psychological mystery, suspense, thrilling story. P.SI am so happy that this book will be going to be a movie soon..Can't wait for it."
935,Kendall Daley,Took me no time to read at all!!!BATSHIT CRAZY and i lOVE ITT!!! kinda reminded me about Gone Girl!!! Similar feeling i had while reading it!!!!!!! 
936,Sherwestonstec,"Fantastic book, highly recommended! Fast paced and well written characters! Manipulation at its best!"
937,Casi K.,Loved it. Couldn't put it down. Started it this morning and finished this evening. So good! The way this is written just kept me enraptured. Great story!
938,Jeremy,"A taut suspense story that is also an elegantly-written novel - what a joy! (I'm used to one or the other: good action yarns are rarely examples of eloquence and insight.) The story's tri-focal point of view is a fascinating way to tell the story, as we are given three first-hand accounts of situations surrounding the central horrific event. Our narrators, the haunted, fragile Megan; whiny, pampered Anna; and bat-shit crazy alcoholic Rachel each have unique takes on the matters at hand. It's remarkable that the author is able to make us sympathize with two of the three: Anna is a hopeless case, but we warm to the brittle Megan in spite of her insecurities and most surprisingly, to Rachel, the main narrator, despite her self-destructiveness and wrong-headed choices at every turn. The woman is a disaster, but like so many train wrecks, we find it hard to turn our eyes away. The book screams for a film adaptation, but I hope they don't do it. The way to appreciate this one is to curl up with the book. Preferably during a thunderstorm (but away from alcohol and sharp objects)."
939,Skyler,Never thought I would love a mystery.
940,Tammy Boissonneault,Loved the book! Was a quick read and keeps you guessing!
941,Tonya,Big Little Lies meets Gone Girl!
942,Drew,Top 3 of the year for sure
943,Samantha Ridenhour,"At first I thought it was because I'm an Anglophile that I couldn't put this book down ..but nope...its that good! I thought I had it figured out then 27 twists later (ok, slight exaggeration)....THE END. Everything played out vividly in my head. Now I need to go find another book set in England."
944,Susan Barton,"Rachel’s life has become a pathetic lie. Because of her excessive drinking, her marriage has ended and now she’s lost her job. To keep her unemployment a secret from her roommate/landlady, Rachel continues with her daily train commute. The fact that her train takes her past the former home she shared with her ex-husband, and now the home he shares with his new wife, is a painful reminder of what once was. So, instead, Rachel concentrates on the home a few doors down, and watches the goings-on of a young couple she’s named Jess and Jason. She imagines a detailed and happy life for the couple until the one morning she witnesses something shocking. Rachel is drawn into a police investigation, but her frequent blackouts make her an unreliable witness. Even Rachel doesn’t know what to believe. Whoa, this was one crazy book with a bunch of effed up people if I ever read one. The author writes in present tense, which is my least favorite of all tenses, but I understand why she chose it. Paula Hawkins’ writing is so fantastic that I was able to forget what the tense was pretty early on anyway. The story is told from three separate POVs: Rachel, Megan (Jess) and Anna (new wife). One woman is more unstable, damaged and insecure than the next. Or maybe the dysfunctionality is equal, just different. Either way, it makes for some very entertaining reading. I read this book quickly, because it was just so darn good. The middle dragged slightly, but I’m impatient and I wanted to find out what happened. A few times I thought I knew who the “culprit” was, but the story zipped off in another direction so I was definitely kept on my toes. The Girl On The Train is suspenseful, appealing and thoroughly absorbing. Forget the comparisons to Hitchcock. This book is a unique modern day thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat and guessing until the very end. "
945,John Dobbs,"a great mystery I consider this a well crafted murder mystery! The way that Hawkins weaves the story together by going back and forth in time, from different perspectives, revealing just enough of the story to keep you turning the pages is masterful! "
946,Hollyberry,"I loved this one! It was curious to read about a situation from an unreliable narrator, she was drunk most of the time. Rachel is a 30 something year old who has been married and divorced with no children. At the beginning of the novel things were slowly put in to place by her and a couple other characters, and as you keep reading (especially from Rachel's point of view) you begin to wonder if everything is part of their imagination, or has it actually happened.There was things going on where I thought I figured out what the big twist was, but on more than one occasion, I was totally wrong, I actually love when this happens, you get more out of a story I think. The characters were generally likable, even Rachel sometimes, at other times you really just want to shake her with the drinking. One thing I can never figure out is why Rachel would want to put herself in the same situation time after time, but in the end it all seems to come together.I can sortive see where people are getting the comparison to Gone Girl, however, I think that they both stand on their own tow feet very well, and if you liked one you should like the other. At first I didn't know what to think when Jess went missing, was she really missing, or did she run away with someone else? That part kept the story going at a really good pace.I am not sure what else to say without getting in to spoilers, however, if you are looking for a great thriller that will keep you guessing right till the very end, this is a story for you! I give it a 5/5!"
947,Lauren Nicholson,"Wow....This book was a slow start for me, but man what a thrilling ride once it got going! Amazing character development, loved the perspective changes throughout. Kudos to the author!!"
948,Jessica L. Skiston,"Good ReadI loved the story line, a book I didn't want to put down. I love books with more then one side of the story."
949,Erin Rose wright,great twists and turnsVery enjoyable read. I loved the story and would highly recommend to other readers. I would look forward to other books by this author. 
950,Melanie,"As is always the case for me, when I saw all the hype surrounding this book, I knew immediately that I wanted to read it. The description sounded entertaining, and I had high hopes: and The Girl on the Train still managed to exceed my expectations in every way.The unreliable narration that lies at the heart of this book is enthralling, and it pulled me in and kept me on my toes for the entire novel. Usually, I get frustrated if I don't know what's going on when I'm reading, but Hawkins manages to perfectly balance on the line between reader understanding and curiosity: I never knew the whole story, but I knew enough to keep me interested.In the end, what I like most about this book is that the ending provides enough of a ""twist"" to be entertaining, while still providing enough hints for an astute reader to see what's coming, or at least the direction it will be coming from. It is not often that I say a book ends perfectly, but for me, The Girl on the Train did exactly that.I could go on, but in the end the important takeaway from this review is simple. As far as mystery/thrillers go, this book is, without a doubt, one of the best I've found.Rating: 5 Stars"
951,Gaby Meares,"All I can say is...wow! What a ride! I don't want to say too much and spoil the fun. This starts slow, and gets creepier, and the pace picks up, and then it really races at the end (a bit like a train picking up speed). I listened to this from audible.com and it was a perfect book to accompany me on my commute. The three female narrators were voiced by 3 actors which added to the tension. You don't know until the end who's a reliable narrator and who isn't. Very clever.I'm sure this will be adapted for the screen, but I highly recommend you read it first. "
952,Corinna Bub,"""Auf alle anderen in diesem Abteil wirke ich völlig normal; ich tue, was sie tun: zur Arbeit pendeln, Termine machen, Dinge erledigen. WIE MAN SICH IRREN KANN.""Dieses Buch ist wirklich wie Zug fahren. Ein kurzes Ruckeln und schon nimmt es mächtig an Fahrt auf. Ich werde nicht lange drumherumreden: Ich liebe dieses Buch - und zwar vom allerersten Moment an. Erwartet habe ich aufgrund des Hypes nicht viel, denn leider wird man ja des Öfteren von ""solchen"" Büchern enttäuscht. Einen Hinweis auf Gillian Flynns Gone Girl werdet ihr hier bei mir nicht finden, denn mir ist schleierhaft wo dieser Vergleich herkommt?! Natürlich ist nichts so wie es scheint - anders wäre ja auch doof... :-)Die Geschichte wird in drei Teilen erzählt.Rachel (Juli 2013 - September 2013)Rachel ist 33 Jahre alt und wohnt in einem Londoner Vorort, in einem kleinen Zimmer bei ihrer ehemaligen Klassenkameradin. Diese lässt sie nur aus Mitleid bei sich wohnen, denn Rachel bekommt seit der Scheidung von ihrem Mann gar nichts mehr auf die Reihe - zudem ist sie Alkoholikerin. Sie fährt täglich mit dem Zug zur Arbeit nach London und wieder zurück. Der Zug stoppt immer an der selben Stelle uns so hat Rachel die Gelegenheit, einige der Anwohner zu beobachten. Eine junge Frau hat es ihr besonders angetan - so ein Leben möchte sie haben - hier scheint alles perfekt zu sein.Megan (Mai 2012 - Juli 2013)Die 29-jährige Megan fühlt sich völlig unbeobachtet und führt alles andere als ein perfektes Leben. Sie geht kaum noch aus dem Haus, belügt und betrügt ihren Ehemann und geht zum Psychologen. Eines Tages verschwindet sie einfach. Kurz zuvor wird sie noch von Rachel mit einem fremden Mann in ihrem Garten gesehen. Auch am Tag ihres Verschwindens war ihre Beobachterin ganz in ihrer Nähe, aber da diese mal wieder total neben sich stand und einen ihrer Blackouts hatte, ist sie der Polizei keine große Hilfe. Doch noch während der Suche nach Megan, zeigt sich wer sie wirklich war und welche ""Leichen"" sie im Keller begraben hatte.Anna (Juli - August 2013)Anna ist keine Sympathieträgerin und ziemlich hinterlistig. Sie ist nun mit Rachels Mann zusammen und lebt mit ihm in Rachels ehemaligen Haus. Während diese ihm keine Kinder schenken konnte, wurde Anna noch während ihrer Affäre mit ihm schwanger. Fast täglich wird sie von Rachel belästigt - auf der Straße, am Telefon ... Sie hat richtig Angst vor der alkoholkranken Frau. Ihre Mann ist ihr keine große Hilfe, denn er hat Rachel gegenüber ein total schlechtes Gewissen und nimmt sie daher immer in Schutz. Obwohl die Geschichte aus drei Perspektiven erzählt wird, bleibt Rachel die Hauptakteurin. Ich konnte mich richtig in sie hineinversetzen und mit ihr mitfühlen. Man war richtig dabei, während ihr Leben immer weiter ""entgleiste"". Im Mittelpunkt steht die Frage: Ist Rachel die Täterin oder das Opfer? Soll man Mitleid mit ihr haben oder sie hassen? Paula Hawkins hat tolle Nebenfiguren eingeflochten, die eine Bedeutung haben könnten - aber nicht müssen. So legt sie ganz nebenbei noch ein paar irreführende Spuren, die welche sein könnten, oder auch nicht... Da wären Rachels Mitbewohnerin, deren Freund und ein fremder Mann aus dem Zug, Megans Psychiater und ihr Mann, außerdem noch Annas Mann bzw. Rachels Ex-Mann.Oft ist es nicht so wie es scheint. Die Autorin lässt einen hinter die Fassade dieser drei unterschiedlichen Frauen blicken und am Ende gibt es eine große Überraschung und man kapiert: Es ist wirklich nichts so wie es scheint.""Wahrscheinlich schaut jeder - jeder schaut auf diese Häuser, an denen der Zug vorüberfährt -, nur sieht jeder sie anders.""Die Hauptstory spielt im Juli - man kann richtig nachempfinden wie unwohl sich Rachel in dem vollgestopften und nicht klimatisierten Zug fühlt. Dazu noch ihr Übergewicht und ihre Benommenheit durch ihren ständigen Alkoholkonsum. ""Die Knöpfe meiner unangenehm engen Bluse spannen über dem Busen, und unter meinen Achseln zeichnen sich Flecken ab, die Feuchtigkeit liegt klamm auf meinen Armen. Meine Augen und meine Kehle jucken."" Fazit: Eine unglaublich fesselnde Geschichte. Ein unglaublich guter Schreibstil. Ein unglaublich gutes Ende."
953,Beth,Suspense!!!! Right up to the end!
954,Laurel L. Perez,"I've been ruminating on this story for a few hours, since finishing it I have been trying to find the right words. Here is what I have come up with, first off, the title of this book is a bit misleading, one might believe it's going to be just another cheesy thriller who-done-it, it's not. Sure, it's thrilling, and you'll be wondering who the heck did it up until the end, but that's such an understatement of this book. Secondly, this book has some complex characters, and though the book is told in alternating chapters between three different women, it manages to be real, and the differences between these women are very clear. This is not an easy writing feat. And finally, the thing that I was most surprised by, and was not expecting, this book is so deeply human. More often than not, books like this tend to have very flat characters, but each and every main player in this book has a full conception. I don't want to say anymore, for fear of spoilers, just know that if you like real people, complex, broken, terrible and beautiful characters, and a little who-done-it, then read this book, it is unlike anything else I have ever read in the genre."
955,Leigh Merriman,"Very good!The best book I've read in a while. Really quite suspenseful. Although I saw the end coming, it was a fantastic read."
956,Carol Lander,"Besides being a thrilling story, you can absolutely feel the emotion of the main character, Rachel. You can feel her obsessiveness, her pain, her shame, her feeling of unworthiness. You aren't practically in her shoes, you are in her shoes at times, feeling her desperation so acutely. But at the same time you are beside her wanting to champion her on to do what's right. ""No, don't do that! Yes, do that! No, don't do that!"" All the way through the gripping story until the end when she draws on her inner strength that seems to elude her throughout most of the book up until the last pages."
957,Jem Carmody,"A creepy psychological thriller.. When a woman on a train witnesses a potential crime, she is dragged further into a story that she struggles to escape.. Exacerbated by a drinking problem and various emotional issues, the main character is highly flawed, and not even necessarily likeable, but the plot is intriguing and the pace is quick and easy to enjoy.. This has been my first 'night-feeding' book since my little one turned up a week ago, and it was really easy to get carried along by this novel..Very good.. Just my cup of tea.. Worth a read. "
958,Ellen Cathey,"I listened to this as an audio book, which I'm glad of because of the accents which I adore. If you are someone like me who occasionally chooses to listen to a book rather than listen to music on the way to work, this is one I'd recommend as an audio because it makes it simple to keep the characters straight from the beginning. The only problem is that you won't want to turn it off until you get to the end. I was all-consumed until the last word of the last page. Found myself listening during my lunch hour, after work and lots of times I shouldn't have been-- it was captivating. I see why some reviewers have compared this book to Gone Girl. It has in common three things: a missing person; a narrative that shifts point of view and timeframe and forces the reader to start to put the pieces together; and the insight into the ugly underbelly of the human experience that great authors seem to gravitate toward and understand. And like when I was reading Gone Girl, I found myself obsessively shutting out the world to finish it.I latched on to the premise immediately. A lonely, desperate girl watches people from her seat on a daily commuter train and makes up stories in her head. Don't we all watch people and do the same thing to some extent? But then she crosses the line, several in fact, into non-normal and unacceptable behavior and we see that she is, as the book says, ""unstable"", and soon we aren't sure where the stories stop and start and reality comes in. But as readers, we want to know what is really going on here. And so the story is able to pull us along first into Rachel's pathetic, sad, booze-clouded narrative. This character is tragically messed up and yet oddly thrilling until we wonder if all of us don't have the potential to become a little like Rachel. Then we ask the the same about Ana,Scott, or Megan given the right set of circumstances. The thought makes me shiver. So in a way, it's almost a cautionary tale. Don't let yourself slip or you might slide too far and find yourself on the wrong side of a newspaper headline! I'll never ride a train without thinking of this book. Weirdly, I really want to. Ride a train, that is, and watch the people....A great read."
959,Darjeeling,Wow. Probably the best thriller I've read since Gone Girl. 
960,Bridget Budda,"Couldn't put it down... It won't stand the test of time as a classic or anything, but it's such a fast read and so absorbing that I had to give it 5 stars. Definitely worth reading. "
961,Roxanne Cordonier,"Really enjoyed it. The main character is such a hot mess, but very sympathetic at the same time. The twists and turns at the end will keep you riveted. If you've ever been dumped, divorced, had a crappy job or gone on an extended bender you will relate to this story."
962,Sharon Moonbeam,"Wow! This book just screams ""crazy psychological thriller"". It's the the kind of book or movie I am not normally drawn to..but I couldn't put it down. Well, I did have to put it down just to get out of those crazy brains for awhile. I might need to give it a 5star rating on those merits alone. It's like a Steven King novel in the way it gets into your psyche and it takes awhile to shake it loose. I was able to catch on to who the killer was, but all of the characters were so crazy, it kept you in suspense. I see it's picked up to be a major film. It could go either way as a film...super intense and edge-of-your-seat scary thriller, or a complete and utter dud. Let's hope for the former! Except, does it work when you already know how it ends?"
963,Laura Moore,Wow! I literally could not put this book down. Thanks mum for lending it to me! x
964,miss.mesmerized,"Jeden Tag im Zug beobachtet Rachel eine recht biedere Wohngegend und überlegt, wer wohl die Menschen sind, sie dort leben. Sie selbst wohnte dort ebenfalls einmal, in einem anderen Leben, vor der Scheidung und bevor sie angefangen hat zu trinken. Sie fährt eigentlich auch gar nicht zur Arbeit, denn ihren Job hat sie schon vor langer Zeit verloren, doch das mag sie gegenüber ihrer Mitbewohnerin nicht zugeben und hält daher den Schein aufrecht. Doch eines Morgens bekommt eine der Fassaden einen Riss, als sie eine der Bewohnerinnen einen anderen Mann küssen sieht. Es kommt jedoch noch schlimmer: genau diese Frau, Megan, wird kurz danach vermisst und dann ermordet aufgefunden. Was ist geschehen? Für Rachel tut sich ein Abgrund auf, denn sie war am Tatabend vor Ort, um ihren Exmann, der immer noch dort wohnt, zu sehen. Doch sie war so betrunken, dass sie sich an nichts erinnern kann. Kurze Erinnerungen schleichen sich ein, doch sie bekommt sie nicht in ein vertrauenswürdiges Bild. Auch die Polizei will ihr keinen Glauben schenken, obwohl sie diesen anderen Mann auch ganz sicher gesehen hatte. Daher wendet sie sich an den trauernden Ehemann und setzt damit weitere Ereignisse in Gang.Der Roman ist geschickt konstruiert, da er auf verschiedenen Zeitebenen spielt und unterschiedliche Perspektiven anbietet. Es sind die Frauen, Rachel als Beobachterin, Megan, das Opfer, und Anna, die neue Frau von Rachels Ex, die die Ereignisse aus ihrer jeweiligen Position schildern. Rachel als Alkoholiker, Megan mit offenkundigen psychischen Problemen und Anna als unsympathische und rücksichtslose „Neue“ bieten dabei alle drei keine vertrauenswürdige Berichterstattung an, so dass man hin und her gerissen ist zwischen Glauben und Zweifel, was der Spannung ausgesprochen zuträglich ist. Insbesondere die Figur der Rachel ist glaubwürdig und facettenreich gezeichnet, wie sie als Alkoholikerin kämpft für ihr Leben, gegen die Abhängigkeit, versucht, eine Normalität und Schein aufrechtzuerhalten und doch immer wieder scheitert. Der Mordfall wird ebenfalls in sich logisch erklärt und nachvollziehbar aufgelöst. Fazit: Für mich ist es kein Thriller wie im Klappentext angeführt, denn dafür fehlt mir die psychologische Spannung. Aber ein sehr überzeugender und unterhaltsamer Krimi ist es allemal. "
965,Sara Rocha,"""A rapariga no comboio"" é aquele tipo de livro que queremos levar para todo o lado. É o tipo de livro que quase nos impede de sair de onde estamos porque não queremos parar de ler. Gosto de livros assim. Que me obrigam a pensar neles quando estou a fazer outras coisas. Este livro é tudo isso e muito mais. Tem uma história brilhante e surpreendente. Personagens complexas e cheias de contornos arrepiantes e inesperados. Muito bem, Paula Hawkins!"
966,Rachelle Rose,"For the complete review please go to: Rachelle Reads!""...The story begins with Rachel. She is a divorcee who spends too much time at the bottom of a bottle. Yet, every day she commutes to London for work, and every day the train slows in the same spot. In this spot, Rachel has vicariously watched this couple live out their life through their windows. Despondent from her own failed marriage she imagines their marriage to be loving and warm. Everything she use to have, but her world quickly begins to unravel when the wife goes missing as she is inevitably drawn into the investigation.Megan, on the outside, lives a charmed life with her husband Scott. But on the inside, she is unraveling ..."""
967,Megan Lee,"The concept tag for this book is Gone Girl meets Rear Window, and I think that's an accurate description. This novel has all the page-turning suspense of Gone Girl combined with the voyeuristic delight of Rear Window. This novel resonated with me right away since I used to live in London and took the train often into English suburbia and beyond. I spent hours looking out train windows and wondering who lived in the passing row houses and what their lives were like. That's kind of the premise with which this novel begins. Rachel, the main narrator, travels on the same train at the same time every day. The train stops daily at the same signal light where she is able to glimpse the backside of a Victorian row house and the couple that lives therein. She's constructed a whole life for this unknown couple, given them names, talents, careers. The narrator soon reveals that this house is only four down from where she used to live in her old life that included a husband and a job. Her life is very different now, and as the novel unfolds, Rachel recalls life then and now. Because of her struggles with alcoholism and blackouts, she becomes embroiled in a murder mystery, sure that something she's forgotten is a key clue in solving the mystery.Told through the point-of-view of three narrators, this novel is a fast-paced and riveting dark mystery with well-developed, likeable, and believable characters. Rachel is a sympathetic character who is terribly flawed but recognizes her shortcomings. This is one of those novels I would term brilliantly crafted, as the writing is as good as the story, and the plot twists are well-paced and placed. The Girl on a Train is suspenseful and not predictable, and although I did figure out ""whodunnit"" before the end of the book, it took nothing away from the story.Not only is this the best book I've read this month, it's the best book I've read in several months! I dare you to put the book down!"
968,Lourdes,"I read this book because I'm a sucker for a murder mystery and I liked the synopsis. Now, I've read it's been compared to Gone Girl and to me it couldn't be further from. I read Gone Girl, didn't care for it and it was a huge struggle to finish it while I read The Girl on the Train in a day. This book kept my interested from beginning to end, I was more than eager than come to the end and I really liked the story and the way the author developed it. Some people have criticized the end, but Rachel is a woman struggling with big problems and we can't expect an immediate happily every after. I loved this book and would recommend it to anybody that likes a good thriller."
969,Razwan Mahmood,"OMG OMG OMG....... I'm SPEECHLESS!!! I just finished this book half an hour ago and I am still gob-smacked. This book is a gripping thriller that will keep you hooked onto every page. (SPOILER FREE) the story is about a woman called Rachel who commutes to London daily on a train. While on the train she fantasies about a couple who lives by the train tracks. she calls them Jess and Jason. she often wonders what life is like for them (as you do right?) until one day she sees something. It happens very fast but this shakes her world and the small world she's created. As days and weeks go by, terrible things happen and Rachel finally has meaning in her life, despite the fact she put herself in constant danger. She really is more than just the girl on the train. So much more... If you like thrillers then this is for you. This book also exposes the social taboos like drinking and affairs, it really opened my eyes."
970,Barbara,I read through this book like the speed of a train. Very hard to put down!
971,Rebecca Raeske-Grinch,"Life is cyclical. Events run parallel. History repeats itself. This story was intense. I was amazed I figured it out before I hit the halfway point, because usually I suck at that. "
972,"Vicky (Books, Biscuits, and Tea)","With its intriguing premise and Transworld’s reputation for publishing some of the best thrillers I’ve ever read, The Girl on the Train was one of my most anticipated novels of 2015 – and it completely blew me away. Hawkins’s debut took the blogosphere by storm and it has every right to be at the top of the charts. It’s so brilliantly written, so unpredictable and so full of twists and turns that I read the second half in one sitting and would willingly give it 6 stars if I could.One of the (many) reasons why it stood out for me is its narration. Rachel, our main character and narrator, is alcoholic. She’s had drinking problems for quite a while and she even lost her job because of it. And why it’s interesting, as far as the story is concerned, is because she’s unreliable. She often drinks herself to a state where she completely blacks out and has no memory of what she’s done when she wakes up the next morning. Add this to a story where she is the only witness and you’ll have no idea what to believe.All the characters are brilliantly – and very cleverly – written, in a way that makes it impossible for you to know who to trust or who to believe. Not just Rachel, but everyone has their own version of events and they are all acting suspiciously in one way or another. I love books with unreliable narrators and The Girl on the Train was no exception.

973,Tejas Janet,"I really liked this book. Came in with fairly low expectations - because I'm usually just not that into thrillers. But this one had an interesting slant that really pulled me in. It wasn't ""perfect,"" but I still will give it five stars. About the ending... (view spoiler)[ I didn't think it made sense for Rachel and Anna to lie about what happened. Then I thought about it and decided maybe they did this for several reasons. We don't really know what happens with this loose end about whether Scott will he be tried and found guilty for the murder of Megan? Is this because Rachel has decided he's dangerous and deserves to be put behind bars to protect other women from him? Anna's reason for lying might be to protect her daughter from the stigma of going thru life with a murderous father. Yes, he will be known as the father who physically attacked his ex-wife and was killed by her in self-defense. But he was ostensibly driven to it by Rachel's continued presence in their lives, at least that's the public façade they could adopt. Any way, these questions bugged me some, and I thought the ending would have been better if these had been wrapped up more forthrightly by the author.  (hide spoiler)]That said, I couldn't stop reading this. A real page turner for me!!"
974,Laurel,"The Girl on the Train blends the suspense of Gillian Flynn’s Gone Girl with the angst of Claire Messud’s The Woman Upstairs. Rachel Watson, divorced, alcoholic and “mentally unstable,” is the girl on the train. She rides it every day to and from a job she no longer has, past a house she no longer lives in, and looks into the windows of other’s lives. In particular, she fixates on No. 15 Blenheim Road, where Jason and Jess live, so-named by Rachel. She’s named them and given them fictional lives she covets, until one day she sees “Jess” hugged and kissed by a man not “Jason” and the next day is reported missing. Thus begins The Girl on the Train.Told in three voices, Rachel’s, Megan’s (Jess’s) and Anna’s (Rachel’s ex’s new wife), the novel, while gripping, is at its best in these characterizations, particularly Rachel’s. I was most affected by her torment, her shame, and yes, her alcohol-induced instability. The Girl on the Train makes for excellent reading and would make an equally first-rate film. I wouldn’t be surprised to see this happen."
975,Lauren,"The Girl on the Train was SUCH a thrill! I am not aware of the proper literary term, but I love the fact each chapter goes from the perspective of multiple characters. Usually, I find it hard to follow but this was so well-written. I loved the character development throughout the book because you were building Rachel's character along with her. As she was trying to remember who she is/was as a person, the reader follows along with her. I love books which make you constantly try and guess the ending, but this book's ending... UGH. I hate when girls say this, but I can't even.LOVED IT."
976,Büşra, Yanımdan geçen insanların ne iş yaptığını ya da bir eve bakarken içinde kimler yaşadığını çok merak ederdim. Bunun anormal bir şey olduğunu zannediyordum. Yalnız olmadığımı öğrenmiş oldum Rachel sayesinde :D Teşekkürler Rachel'a gidiyor. Ve katil... O.o Asla tahmin edemezdim ben.
977,Caroline Viola,"This book was really amazing. The characters were extremely dynamic and the writing was amazing. The beginning is a bit slow, but it's definitely worth it. If you liked this book, I suggest reading ""The Secret History"" by Donna Tartt. It has a similar twisted feel that keeps you continually guessing. Honestly, it's a little unsettling how much of myself and others I saw in the characters of this book. All the way through, I saw pieces of myself in Rachel. The most unsettling part is that I started to see my ex boyfriend in Tom towards the end. All in all, a wonderful and fast paced read. "
978,Jill Fedge,Couldn't put it down... Not of major substance but a page turner
979,Dee dee,"Loved this book! A great page turner, when I had time to read it, lol. Kinda reminded me of Gone Girl."
980,Caz Holland,"A book I couldn't put downA life of denial, routine, self-destruction and imagination, changes in an instant on a simple regular commuter train journey. Has this single event really altered Rachel's life forever? What are Tom and Anna doing? And where is Jess? I found this book easy to read and hard to put down almost immediately, as opposed to some novels which take a bit of work to follow and get into the story lines at first. That being said, the book is not simple and is therefore very well written; following the timeline diaries of some of the characters in order to weave a complex tale, in an unguessable plot until the last few pages.You cant help feeling that this book has been written by an author who has experienced or understands the twists and human emotions that have been captured brilliantly; and whom highlights varying human conditions as each frailty arises perfectly. In short a really good read for someone who wants a 'look over your shoulder' kind of book ~ enjoy"
981,Carol/Bonadie,"A pageturnerish mystery that begins when Rachel Sanders observes a couple in their apartment while she passes in the train, every day. She becomes interested in watching for them, creates a story about them, and we are off an running with a surprising, twisty story that sometimes get messy and out of control but is never dull."
982,Lindsey Caturia,"If I could rate this higher than 5 stars, I would! This is THE BEST book I have ever read! "
983,Alyce,"I read this book in one sitting because it was just too intriguing to put down. I immediately identified with Rachel, our first narrator, whose life has basically hit rock bottom. After trying to conceive a child only to be told she was barren, she began drinking heavily to ease her pain. Her marriage begins falling apart as a result, and her husband ends up leaving her for another woman. Alone, alcoholic, and depressed, Rachel moves into the spare bedroom of an old friend and survives of off cheap liquor and spending her day on long train rides to London and back. Much of her storyline is spent idealizing her past and acting out in drunken rages to try and get her life back. As a divorcee, I understood the hopelessness she faces at times and completely empathized with some of her struggles. She does, however, become frustrating as she refuses to move on and start her life over—she is happier living in a fantasy world where she makes up people and relationships in her mind. Enter Megan. Megan is a woman that Rachel sees every day from the train, and Rachel has constructed a fantasy world about Megan and the life she leads. Megan lives a few doors down from Rachel’s ex-husband and his new wife, so she often fixates upon Megan to pass the time as the train passes by the station. Rachel builds Megan up as a paragon of womanhood—representing everything she herself lost, until one day, she sees Megan doing something shocking. This causes Rachel to relive the emotions of her own sordid past and she grows angry at the fictional person Megan has come to represent in her twisted imaginary world. She soon learns Megan’s real identity as Megan turns up missing the following day. Rachel has no memory of the evening of Megan’s disappearance as she was on an alcohol-fueled rampage on Megan's street harassing her ex-husband and his new wife Anna. She wonders…where is Megan, and is she responsible?This event throws Rachel into a tailspin. Her life and hold on reality slips even further. As she struggles to remember what happened, she involves herself in Megan’s life and disappearance to a degree that is dangerous to her physically and legally. As she slips further from herself, Rachel comes closer to the truth. We briefly see Anna, the new wife’s, perspective on the events throughout the novel, but the reader is left wondering constantly, who can I trust? We have a drunk, a liar, and a home-wrecker. Whose intentions can we truly see and who has hidden motives?This thrill ride of a novel will keep you turning the pages until the end when the reader, Rachel, and Anna come face to face with the shocking truth."
984,Susanna,"Brilliant read - the pace of the book never slackens as the stories unfold. There is an honesty about flawed characters; the three women in this book are all struggling one way or another and the theme running through is how women punish themselves. I read a lot of reviews about the book before I bought it - a lot of them stated that none of the characters were likeable, but I really felt for Rachel - yes she is an alcoholic, but as we travel through her story I had a lot of sympathy for her.This is a story of hope, I was only a third of the way in and I realised just how blessed my life was - Rachel’s loneliness seeped off the pages. She was at her lowest ebb and while she might have done dreadful things, I believe she was trying hard to please everyone around her. Imagine going to London by train every day and hanging about in Libraries because you don’t want your flatmate to know you have lost your job. She never burdened Cathy (her flatmate) with any of the pain she was suffering, why she was drinking, she carried her burdens alone. Its pity that prevented her from opening up, when you are at your lowest ebb, pity is unbearable. Despite being labelled crazy, dismissed and scorned, she is very brave, she tries to help people, Scott, and Anna, even though they treat her with such contempt. Rachel does pull her life together the ending was very satisfying and hopeful. Paula Hawkins writing is excellent, this story drew me in, the characters portrayed so well - and the pace relentless. It takes talent and skill to pull that off, I can’t wait to read more, for a first book this is an astounding achievement. "
985,Amanda Barrett,"A slick, on the edge of your seat style thriller, with a highly original plot. I loved this book, so much so that I don’t want to give away any of the plot for fear of ruining the reading experience for others. What I will say is that having made the commute to London Paula Hawkins so vividly described, I felt like I was right there on the train with the main character, Rachel. The Girl on the Train is an excellent piece of writing for a debut author, I cannot wait to see what Paula Hawkins comes up with next."
986,Alyasa  Abbas,"OH MY GOD!one unreliable narrator makes it hard alone, but Three! Rachel- The most frequent narrator. Alcoholic, troubled, divorced, jobless.Anna- Pretentious, Self-obsessed, jealous, liar.Megan- LIAR, cheat, a Had-been-drug-addict.AND NO ONE AMONG THE THREE CAN BE TRUSTED.There aren't too many characters, which makes it even more confined, tight, gripping, enthralling. The prose is as simple as it is effective, with red herrings all over the place. you think it could be that one for a moment, the next moment you're convinced that it can't be them. Although you know you can't trust the narrators, you have But no choice. And you fall right into Hawkins' trap, guessing and guessing till the very end. Every single character is flawed, and their flaws well portrayed. Hawkins' character insight is Brilliant. And having the story narrated by three women was a masterstroke.Anyone who loves a mind boggling, deep and dark, disturbing and brilliantly crafted psychological thriller, go grab THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN! NOW!"
987,Angela (thegeekyauror),"Something happened that day. Something that triggered the events that connects three women: an alcoholic, a mistress and a cheater. Rachel, Anna and Megan, three different women and each one of them has a different role to play.Have you ever wondered how other people live their life? Have you created a story about those strangers you saw? Named them? Made a perfect story about them thinking it was you? Rachel, the girl on the train, did. Whenever the train stopped at the station, she will observe the couple, which she named Jess and Jason, through the train window until one day something happened. Something that destroyed her perfectly crafted story about Jess and Jason. Something that she cannot remember. Something that pulled her into their lives. Something that tied Rachel, Anna and Megan together.When I saw The Girl On The Train on my favorite book store, I searched it on goodreads and found that it is somewhat similar to Gone Girl. Somewhat similar because it's much more fast-paced and more creepier. Which I cannot fully agree because I haven't read Gone Girl yet. But it is fast-paced and creepy.The book is full of mystery, secrets and lies. Lies that leads to another lie that they didn't notice that they're living a life full of lies. Paula Hawkins wrote a book that is utterly unpredictable. I came up with at least five theories on how the book will end, and none of them was correct. It's just frustratingly beautiful.I recommend this book to those people who loves mystery and thriller.NOTE: Free yourself before reading this because once you start you cannot stop until it's finished."
988,Sue Lauzon,"OMG!!! This book was soooo good!!! So many twists in the plot it keeps you guessing until almost the end. Psychological thriller about a woman who witnesses something she feels the police should know except when the delve into her past they deem her an unreliable witness. Book proves the point that our memories and perceptions of what we think, are not always remotely close to what actually was or is. I think the only part I was remotely disappointed in was the ending. Didn't seem totally believable to me in the fact that we live in a more violent society today than in years past. But then again it is a psychological thriller so I guess he has to toy with her for awhile anyway."
989,Jazz,"It would be unfathomable to my slightly younger self that I would find so much to explore in the way of gender politics from mystery/thriller bestsellers, but authors like Gillian Flynn and Paula Hawkins have changed my mind. This is a book for every heartbroken woman who needs reminding that the lost relationship was never that good to begin with. Paula Hawkins spends ample time will all three of her narrators, all experiencing grief, all looking for power, and all struggling with being and being unable to be a mother--the only role for which women are valued. It isn't typical family drama, though it might sound that way. The Girl on the Train is a dark, puzzling story without sentimentality."
990,Mary Ann,Thoroughly enjoyed this mystery. It kept me guessing until the very end. The author alternated chapters based on the view points of the three main characters. It was cool to see each one's individual perspectives which was very different from the persona they presented to others. This book is in the vein of Gone Girl but not quite as good. Still I would recommend it. This is one of those books that's hard to put down. My only criticism was sometimes I just wanted to shake the main character and slap her across the face to stop making bad choices!
991,Kate Moretti,"One of my new favorite books! I couldn't put this book down, I was reading it sitting in traffic, when I got out of the shower. I was late to work, up in the middle of the night, and ignoring real life. The alcoholic flashbacks were appropriately chilling and terrifying: the ultimate unreliable narrator. To be honest, I guessed the ending at a little over halfway. I didn't care at all, the unraveling was psychologically riveting. The whole concept is fascinating: A girl watches a couple from the window of a train every day and gives them an invented identity. Neighbor watching is a common phenomenon and Hawkins turns it sinister in an ingenious way. This book lives up to the hype!"
992,Carol,"I very much enjoyed this book. It is told from three characters points of view with Rachel being the main character, as she is the girl on the train. I liked the short chapters which always keeps me reading and I also was eager to get back to the other women's stories.At first, I found the voices of the three women to be similar but in time I realized they in many ways had similar qualities. The ending is a bit over the top, but most thrillers end with a bang.I've seen comparisons to ""Gone Girl"" and a modern day Hitchcock and I found it to be all that."
993,Janaki Kuruppu,"Thrilling ride! Held me in suspense, with great characterizations. One of those books that has you saying to the characters ""oh, don't go there, don't do that!"" Right up to the end. Excellent twist at the end, and it didn't seem like a cheat. I highly recommend it, and the audio book version is excellent. Three actresses reading three characters, and do such a great job."
994,Geraldine,How did this collection of dysfunctional characters find each other? I enjoyed the book from beginning to end. Unlike other reviewers I didn't figure out the killer until almost the end so I was reading late into the night to get the answer.
995,Steve Sagonas iii,very good book love how it was told from different perspectives couldn't put it down
996,Cori Arnold,I started on page 18 in the morning... and I was done by the evening. I couldn't put it down. I loved the pace. I loved the unlikable characters. I was reminded at every stage of Patricia Highsmith's dark brooding and psychological twists.
997,Becky McKay Galante,Suspenseful and creative. Great story development and characters.
998,Lindsay (Little Reader Library),"The Girl on the Train is Paula Hawkins' debut novel, and it's a cracker of a read. She's delivered one of those stories that you don't want to stop reading until you reach the end because it becomes so tense and the chain of events and revelations keep you hooked, the fast-paced storytelling reins you in and doesn't let go. This is a gripping psychological crime thriller, a genuine page turner of a novel. The opening premise is a great idea, and so easy to identify with - how, whilst travelling by train, we might look out of the window and observe the lives of others playing out in gardens backing on to the tracks, and imagine what those lives might be like. Three young women narrate the story in turn, and each one of them had me questioning what was true, what was really happening, what could I believe, Rachel in particular I thought was very compelling the way her character was drawn and fleshed out. A couple of quibbles aside, which I can't really mention because they would be spoilers, I found this to be an addictive, twisty read and a cleverly told debut novel which I think will be massively popular with readers. 4.5 stars rounded up to 5."
999,Janna,"Wow! What an incredible story. I was constantly interested, always trying to figure it out, wondering what would happen next. And I love how she wrote the story by date from three different perspectives. I loved knowing exactly what was going on in each character's head. Paula is a talented writer, with a creative mind. What a crazy, twisted, incredible story.*SPOILER ALERT*My only complaint is all the evil. All the lies, the addicts, the affairs, the abuse. Even our heroine, Rachel, was a drunken liar. This book made we wonder if the author has never had a real friend or an honest relationship. (Which is clearly a super harsh and unrealistic judgment :P) But I would have felt better if she'd have included more good, honest characters in this evil little world of hers. I guess that's why I do better reading Teen Fiction ;)"
1000,Jocelyn Condenzio-Hall,"I'm not sure which book those who so vehemently disliked it were reading, but I found The Girl on the Train definitely lived up to its more positive press. The Girl on the Train was a taut, dark, psychological thriller that kept me glued to its pages until the end. Yes, the characters were not especially likeable and were, for the most part, extremely flawed examples of humanity, and that, for me, was one of the elements that kept this reader wanting to know how the mystery would be resolved. The author carefully wove the various threads of the story together so that the reader could gradually get to know the characters as fully dimensional people who were the engines of their fates, not as flat, stock character portrayals. This process of character development, while gradual, was instrumental in building the mystery's tension. As for the book's naysayers, I think perhaps their evaluation of this story was based on a lack of reading stamina wherein they wanted a quick, easy narrative fix that was not too mentally taxing and easily digested for instant gratification. My advice to them is to leave psychological thrillers alone and stick to Harlequin Romances..."
1001,Jennifer Kuchenbecker Thomas,This book was intense and fabulous and heartbreaking. A hell of a ride. I woke up early to take a shower this morning and ended up unshowered and late for work because I needed to finish this book. Great read. 
1002,Stephanie Karr,loved this book
1003,Michelle McKeever,"So good. I was glued to this book and read it in 4 hours. It was that gripping. If you are a fan of Gone Girl or Hitchcockian thrillers, this is a must read.The Girl on the Train is written from a few different perspectives, but focuses mostly on Rachel. To put it delicately, Rachel is having a tough time sorting out her life. Every day, Rachel’s commuter train stops at a signal, which gives Rachel the perfect view of a seemingly happy suburban couple, who she names “Jess and Jason.” Rachel dreams up a magical life for this unsuspecting couple, imagining them as a perfect couple, with a perfect life. However, one day Rachel sees something that shatters the illusion and cannot keep it to herself. Soon, Rachel becomes entwined in the life of this couple in dangerous and thrilling ways.If I haven’t made it clear above, you should definitely read this book. It is enthralling, engaging, and intriguing. It’s not a happy, fluffy novel, so don’t read it expecting any of that. But it is well-written and full of mystery.If you read it, let me know what you think in the comments below!"
1004,Liz Gribbon,"Very odd characters, quick page turner with lots of suspense created continually making you guess what was about to happen and who did it ... Not my usual kind of book but it was interesting "
1005,Tempo de Ler,"«Perdi o controlo sobre tudo, até sobre os lugares dentro da minha cabeça.» (p. 18)Enervante, inesperado e intrigante - A Rapariga no Comboio é um daqueles thrillers em que a leitura se transforma facilmente em compulsão.Mais do que a história, o requinte raposino com que esta é narrada obriga-nos a dedicar-lhe toda a nossa atenção, completamente absorvidos, morbidamente fascinados com as problemáticas vidas destes personagens.Narrado a três vozes, transferimos as nossas suspeitas a cada nova informação, o que acaba por tornar a leitura muito estimulante e dinâmica. Rachel, personagem de particular conceção, é o oposto da comum heroína; de índole autodestrutiva, Rachel comprometeu a sua vida a todos os níveis graças, em grande parte, ao consumo excessivo de álcool. Queremos acreditar nela, apesar de sabermos que recorre à mentira sempre que lhe é conveniente e tememos, tal como ela, pela revelação dos episódios em que o álcool lhe roubou a memória. Nada é o que parece… nem ninguém... Com o enredo inteligente e complexo de um livro que não pretende ser apenas mais um nas nossas prateleiras, A Rapariga no Comboio é já um dos meus preferidos deste ano!"
1006,Katie Ward,"This has been hugely compared to 'Gone Girl,'the huge hit from last year. (Or was it 2013? Time flies!). There are a number of similarities; both are narrated in first person and told from different points of view from the main characters, both tell the story of broken relationships and both are absolutely gripping.The Girl on the Train however keeps everything entirely secret until the last chapters, leaving readers guessing what is happening right until the very end.I found this really well written. Rachel, the main character, is someone that you both love and hate!Really great story and an absolute page turner. There were a few loose ends i would like to have seen tied up i.e. what happens with Scott, with the therapist, but on the whole great story."
1007,Rick Harrington,"I Make up Myself, in PassingMotive disintegrates beneath flaws in everyone's story about each other. I may have read hundreds of books between this one and the last I rated here, though that has to be some exaggeration too. I get put off by social media, as if thought were a train, and as if I wanted anyone to think I had somewhere to go. I'm as lost as the rest of us, and a lot less entertaining.This book popped up because it was on someone else's list to whom I've been algorithmically connected in ways someone more clever than me controls. Some team of people. It has always been the equivalent of being outdoors, naked, to say something, which must be why I flip binary between silent and weird. How should one dress in the social network scene?But we do make up stories about ourselves and about others, and they exist at the same distance that we each exist from ourselves, which is passing distance through a train window if it pauses enough to obey a broken signal. That's the conceit of this book, and it seems right on.It's almost a detective story, teasing a truth that never comes, sort of, but satisfying enough to call it an end and get some sleep, finally, without having to ponder any more than you already have while reading. Nice!There are multiple first persons, and you might be one or several of them, except that they are women and I am but a man who mostly deserves the motives imputed, guilty or no. Clueless.And one whose story is passing into someone else's, because the pieces of it lose coherence beneath memory rotted by age and drink and loss of motive, because someone else imposed theirs on me, is it? Too much self is itself a crime.All that is left are fragments, Tying them together is hard work for a reader, and the author's job is to make it worth the while.Nice work! Thank you!"
1008,Susan A DeeseRoberts,"Great storytelling, lots of twistsPaula Hawkins s is a great storyteller. The reader becomes the main character, Rachel -- the girl on the train. Haven't we all looked out a window, made-up a story about what we've seen? Fallen in love with an illusion? But Rachel with all her flaws, is the one with strength to finally face the truth about herself and others. Conflicts between a wife and the ex-wife, a guilty therapist, lovers and haters -- all could be such typical storylines, but the author takes us on an interesting and unpredictable ride. Gets better as you go along. Recommended read."
1009,Margarita Gautier,Me ha encantado!
1010,Daniel,"Paula Hawkins debut novel is one to remember.I must admit, I wasn't convinced at the start. I didn't seem to be able to understand the characters but I soon got into the storyline. I loved the character of Rachel and it was great to see how your opinions constantly changed throughout.I was gripped continuously at the end and I can now not wait until the film is released. A great job has been done by Hawkins."
1011,Samantha Kaatz Laury,"When I first started reading this book, my first thought was, ""How is this going to get suspenseful? It's just some drunk woman riding a train."" Well, I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly this book picked up the pace, and I had trouble putting the book down. This book had me scratching my head, and thinking, ""Rachel, You are being stupid!"" sometimes at the same time. My only complaint is I wished the author waited a little longer to expose who did it. At about page 250 (give or take) I figured it out, and then I was waiting for the characters to figure it out. This is a must read! "
1012,Rachel Colbert,"While I am a sucker for quite a few literary tools, there is none that I succumb to as much as the unreliable narrator. I think it is the closest thing to having a relationship with a book...god, I'm single. Seriously, with most fiction you accept that you are reading the story as is. No skewing the truth, no hiding (not that much anyway) and no funny business. While some people are that honest, I don't know a single person in the dating world that would assume that about another human being. In that way, a relationship is like reading a book with an unreliable narrator; you can sit for hours and invest yourself in a story and a narrative and completely forget that they have the power to SCREW WITH YOUR MIND. But, for the sake of experiencing the story, you keep reading anyway. You ignore the warning signs, maybe try to figure it out, but know that nothing can come from hypothesizing, you just have to wait for the truth to come then deal with what comes.The only thing better than having one unreliable narrator?Having multiple.No, that is not a metaphor for polygamy. "
1013,Eileen Goudge,"This is one of those books that builds steadily toward a slam-bam climax. I can't say I rooted for the main point of view character, Rachel, but she seemed real and I did feel for her, even though she was her own worst enemy at times. It has some tricky twists and turns, and though I did guess the ending, I still felt compelled to keep turning the pages. I can see why this novel is getting so much buzz. It's hard to put down! I gave it five stars for that alone. I was never bored. "
1014,Janča Jindřichová,"Ale jo, za to, že jsem četla, kudy jsem chodila, tak dávám plný počet hvězd. Hlavní hrdinky mi lezly na nervy všechny a ti dva kohouti taky. Nakonec si moje sympatie asi nejvíc získala ona samotná ""dívka ve vlaku"" Rachel. Jestliže je 50 odstínů ""porno pro mamky"", tak Dívka ve vlaku je ""detektivka/ thriller pro mamky"". Hlavním tématem tam je těhotenství a rodina, ať už chtěná, nechtěná, vytoužená či odmítnutá. Protože nepatřím k pravidelným čtenářům kriminálních románů, tápala jsem do posledních stran, kdo je vlastně vrah. A závěr se bude jistě velmi vyjímat ve filmovém zpracování."
1015,veganjilly,"AWESOME! I was hooked from page one; I could not put this book down. It kept me guessing until the very end, and the complex characters made for a thrilling story. This was a thoroughly entertaining summer read! "
1016,RebeccaS,"Wow. Just wow! I am blown away by this book, because in the beginning I didn't know what all the fuss was about. At first we are introduced to a women riding the train to work and depressed with her own life. Just because of her observations from the train window, she becomes embroiled in captivating missing persons case for a woman she doesn't even know. There are so many twists, turns, lies, and hazy memories that this story keeps you turning the page. (view spoiler)[ The last person I expected to be Megan's murderer was Tom! I didn't like him and thought he was a terrible husband, but didn't have any idea he would have been seeing Megan as well as murdering her. I was really stuck on Scott and I can see why the police and even Rachel thought he was the killer. I just wish poor Rachel had someone in her life to really help her get everything together. Tom used her depressing and drinking against her to make her feel worse and worse. And Anna really only cared about herself. and was blind to her husband's lies Even Rachel's mother was distant and Cathy didn't know Rachel well enough I guess. I also am shocked by how much Tom lied about. (hide spoiler)] This book really shows how complicated marriages can be and all the lies that can fill them."
1017,Kim Kanofsky,"I listened to this book on my commute and whenever I got to my destination I was sad that I had to stop listening! All three voice performances were great and definitely distinct so I could easily tell who was speaking at all times. The red herrings in this book were excellent and even though I grew suspicious early on, I wasn't sure until almost the end of this great mystery. Full of exciting flashbacks from Meagan and Rachael trying to fill in the blanks during her blackouts, this book was worth every second! Loved it!"
1018,Diana Zulkefli,So so so good! Un-put-down-able. Another favorite 
1019,Carolyn Fagan,I could not put this book down. I suspected EVERY character in the book and was still surprised by the ending. Paula Hawkins knows how to write!
1020,Candice Walsh,"Is this the new book that's now cool to hate? Haha. I actually really loved it, and was hooked from the first page. It's been a long, long time since I finished a book in one day. People kept comparing it to Gone Girl but I didn't find it to be that way at all."
1021,Jody  Julian,"“ I’m going to tell her that the line he used with her-don’t expect me to be sane- he used it with me, too, when we were first together; he wrote it in a letter to me, declaring his undying passion. It’s not even his line: he stole it from Henry Miller. Everything she has is secondhand.” Pg. 34, the Girl on the Train by Paula HawkinsHave you ever seen a stranger in your travels every day and wondered what their life was like? That curiosity is taken to a whole new level in The Girl on the Train. Rachel is still reeling from a bad breakup and grieving its loss by drinking more and more. A bright spot in her lonely life is seeing the same couple at a house that her train always stops near. In fact, that couple eventually becomes so real to her that she feels she knows them and gradually an obsession grows. One day, her burgeoning voyeurism on her daily train ride leads to witnessing something that is far out of the norm for this very happy couple she’s named Jess and Jason. What does she do? She knows ‘Jess’ and ‘Jason’ and is now very invested in their lives. Maybe she can help them. Maybe it is her DUTY to help them. Yes, she decides, it’s time to become more involved. Now, before it’s too late.I was so absorbed by this hypnotic book that really, I became the voyeur, too. I was reminded of Patricia Highsmith, and yes, (wait for it) Gone Girl. I was guessing till the very end. I felt a loss when this book was finished. I need more Paula Hawkins! "
1022,Kristin Herrick,I could not put this book down! It was just one thing after another. Great characters and story. THE ENDING. 
1023,Jamela Robledo,"All the characters were well developed even though they were a crazy mess. Definitely a page turner and would recommend this book for people who like a chic-lit mystery. Sorry for labeling it ""chic-lit mystery"" but the characters and their problems would annoy the hell out of some people. A good book though. "
1024,Amy Murphy,"Oh goodness, what a good read! This book kept me up well past midnight because I had to find out what happened. I really love when the authors keep you guessing and Paula Hawkins did not disappoint...and it's her first book! I will definitely read whatever else she writes. "
1025,Jackie Law,"The Girl on the Train, by Paula Hawkins, is a thriller about power within relationships, emotional abuse and the unreliability of memory. It explores an individual’s selective vision, the lies we tell ourselves in order to maintain the fantasies in which we wish to live. It lays bare how memory is a construct as much as a recollection, that interpretation can rely on corroboration. It questions the fanciful, selfish reasons for trust, how we judge and are judged.Rachel is struggling with her life. She has lost her husband, her job and her self respect. Each day she travels to London by train, passing the house where she once lived. She watches a young couple who now live nearby, imagining the happy lives they lead until she almost believes it is real. She feels that she has got to know them, so much so that when one of them disappears she cannot stop herself from becoming involved.Rachel wishes to help, to uncover the truth, but what of her story can be believed? She is an alcoholic, dogged by memory blackouts and vivid dreams. She is an unreliable witness who cannot even be sure herself what she remembers.The plot is compelling, multi layered and tightly written. Each of the characters adds intrigue leaving the reader guessing but never quite sure of where the tale will go next. As each character is forced to shed the blinkers they have chosen to wear and to face what has been happening around them the painful truths cause their lives to implode.The imagery of the train is a constant throughout the book and works well. A journey, strangers, the unrelenting presence like the elephant in the room. I was impressed by the author’s careful unveiling, the pivotal secret and the chilling denouement.This is an engrossing tale that will not disappoint. It may just cause a few more commuters to look out of train windows and imagine the lives that are being lived as they pass by."
1026,Maureen Horrigan,"This psychological thriller will have you turning pages quickly. The story is told through three women, Rachel, Anna, and Megan, whose lives are intertwined in ways they don't even know. The secrets, lies, and betrayals lead to misfortune for all the characters. Enjoy."
1027,Lacie Kronfeld,"Really good suspense, the ending was my favorite. Through the whole book the author Hawkins kept me thinking Rachel was just drunk and she was the one who killed Megan without knowing it, I was wrong. "
1028,Alethea,This book was defiantly a dark read. I had no idea who did it until the end. I was like ohhhhh snap. It was really good. I'm looking forward to seeing the movie next year.
1029,Knitter,A very impressive debut novel.
1030,Diane Vallere,"Disclaimer: I kept myself pretty much in the dark about this book before reading it, GONE GIRL comparisons notwithstanding. I didn't even know it was set in England. I thought the train in question ran from NY to Connecticut! So, the early pages required a bit of adjustment on my part, but before I knew it, I was at page 50, page 100, halfway, then 100 pages left. The narrators weren't immediately likable, but I think they were real with the kind of honesty that usually gets edited. I understand why people say they didn't connect with the narrator(s), but I did find the story to be compulsively readable, which is why I call it a five star read. And while I didn't so much enjoy the character of Rachel, I found that her growth propelled the story forward toward a satisfying ending. "
1031,Tina  M,OMG!!!! This ranks up there with GONE GIRL! Amazing!
1032,Emma de Beer,so good
1033,Katie Pesznecker,"Couldn't put it down. Rachel -- the primary narrator -- is an often unlikeable woman, delusional and depressed, drowning in booze and the dregs of alcoholism since the breakdown of her marriage to Tom. The narration also shifts to Tom's self-absorbed new wife, Anna; and to Megan, a hedonistic and impulsive woman who is suffocating in her role as suburban wife. When Megan goes missing, both Rachel and Anna find themselves involved. What do they know? Where is Megan? That Rachel is drunk nearly all the time and a compulsive liar on top of that makes her a highly unreliable narrator, both to the reader and to her own self. She struggles to reclaim memories from the night Megan went missing -- a night when Rachel was in that neighborhood and black-out drunk. This story is full of surprises, swings and turns, and is gripping to the very end. Anyone who liked Gone Girl will appreciate the creativity in the craft and the many layers of both light and dark in the characters. "
1034,Esseve Rin,"Trendeki Kız dün bitti. Kesinlikle aldığı her övgüyü hak eden bir kitaptı.Konusunu çoğu kişi biliyordur ama ben yine de ufaktan bahsetmek istiyorum.Rachel işini ve evliliğini kaybetmiş, her geçen gün daha da dibe batan bir umutsuz vakadır. Her gün trenle önünden geçtiği 23 numaralı evde yaşayanlara kendi hayalinde hayatlar, isimler vermiştir. Hayaline göre 23 numaralı evin sakinleri, Jess ve Jason, birbirlerine aşık son derece mutlu ve huzurlu bir çifttir. Bir gün yine trenden dışarı izlerken karşılaştığı bir sahne Rachel'ın kafasında kurduğu hayalleri yıkar. Ertesi gün gazetelerde okuduğu bir haber 23 numaralı çiftin hayatını trenden izlemeyi bırakıp bizzat dahil olmasına yol açar. Kitap polisiye türünün en heyecanlı, katil kim acaba diye merakla düşündüren kitabı değil. Ama yazar karakterleri öyle derinlemesine yazmış ki! Okurken kendinizi Rachel'ın duygularından alıkoyamıyorsunuz. Ben okurken onunla birlikte dibe çöküp onunla birlikte çaresizliğin tadına baktım. Diğer karakterlerin hepsinden nefret ettim. Acımasızlıklarından, umursamamazlıklarından, pişkinliklerinden nefret ettim. Gerçek hayatın tüm acımasızlığını önümüze serdiği için yazardan da nefret ettim ama aynı zamanda bu dürüst yönünü sevdim de. Bilmiyorum kafam hala karışık jhkjjg Kitabın sonunda boşta kalan ufak tefek şeyler var ama puan kırmaya değmeyecek şeyler olduğundan 5/5 veriyorum kitaba."
1035,Kelly Hager,"I've heard a lot of complaints around this book, mainly centered around the fact that none of the women in it are particularly likable (especially Rachel, the main narrator). That's true (and thus a valid complaint) but since when is it important that a story be full of good and wonderful people to be a story worth reading?At any rate, if you are thinking of reading this book, do it. And, if it's not already too late for you, try and go in as cold as possible, knowing as little as you can. It's the best way to go in.Also important: try and start it when you have a lot of free time. It's absolutely impossible to stop reading once you start. (Fun fact: the letter from the publisher at the beginning of my e-galley said that one of the Penguin staffers was actually reading this under the desk at a meeting because she was close to the end and couldn't stop. I completely sympathize---I was five minutes late to work because I was close to the end and couldn't stop.)I enjoyed this book a great deal and Paula Hawkins is a new must-buy author for me. Highly recommended."
1036,Antoinette,"This book is quickly becoming the ""must read"" novel of 2015 and I would agree. Paula Hawkins has written an engrossing psychological thriller that held me spellbound, so much so that I read in two days because I could simply not put it down. Gripping, fast-paced, and told with such heart-wrenching honesty, I was totally wrapped up in Rachel, Megan, and Anna, the three women whose lives are changed forever because of what can be seen from a train. I'm amazed this is a debut novel and will certainly be looking forward to more from this author. There is a temptation to compare to ""Gone Girl"" and I think those who like one will like the other because both are intense, cleverly plotted and with not-so-nice ""heroines.""Highly recommend."
1037,Leslie Fitzpatrick,"I read this book in 2 days it was so good. It reminded me of ""Gone Girl"" with the story jumping from different points of view. I can normally predict what's going to happen in a book but I didn't with this one. All the clues were leading me towards Rachel killing Megan so I was surprised by the ending and I'm glad, that doesn't happen often! I loved the irony of Rachel killing Tom with the corkscrew too... nice touch!"
1038,Cobalt714,"Fantastic book. I found it a little slow to begin with and I had a hard time following the jumping from one thread to another, and then I realized that the dates and times were stated at the top of each section, as well as who's story we were following - oops! Paying attention to those details made the whole story a lot easier to follow hehehhe!The Girl on the Train is going through the motions, pretending to live a real life, with a reason to be on a train, a real destination to arrive at, a schedule to keep. In reality, Rachel's life has fallen apart and she spends her days trying to drink her time away and avoid as many reminders of her old life as possible. But her daily train journey takes her past her old house, and as she stares out the window, day after day, she thinks about the people who live next to her old home. She watches these strangers in tiny flashes of their daily lives, she gives them names and makes up stories about them. She grows to think of them as her friends.Then one day she sees something which sours her whole fantasy, and suddenly she feels she needs to intervene in the lives of these strangers, to sort them out, but instead she finds herself involved in a murder investigation, one which brings her all too fully back into her old life.Brilliant twists and turns that will keep the reader guessing all the way to the last page."
1039,Phil Shpilberg,PerfectRead in 3 days. It grabs you in and wont let you go until you really know what and why
1040,Mara,Very intense story! I was sucked in from page 1. I highly recommend it :)
1041,Heather Gilbert,"Read this in a day. Couldn't stop! I love a great psychological mystery, and this was one. Also, I didn't see the ending coming a mile away, which I always appreciate. Some language/situations but not nearly as graphic as Gone Girl. Gripping read, satisfactory ending. Hope Hawkins writes another one along these lines."
1042,Sandy *The world could end while I was reading and I would never notice*,"On the cover of this book SJ Watson calls it 'Gripping, enthralling - a top-notch thriller and a compulsive read'. I agree 100%I simply could not put this book down.It is well written - tight, tense and thrilling all the way. Reading it is like riding a roller coaster.Who is telling the truth?Who is lying?Rachel, an emotionally unstable alcoholic who has recently lost her marriage and her job, rides the train to London every day, keeping up the pretence she still has a job.Everyday she passes the back of the street where she used to live - when she was married - and every day she looks.She makes up stories about the people in the houses - one couple in particular. Then one day she sees something; something that changes the way she sees these people and that will involve her in their lives.A compulsively readable, emotionally immersive, Hitchcockian thriller; this is an electrifying debut. Paula Hawkins I wait impatiently for your next book.I have read some really good books this year, but this is far and away the best."
1043,Mark,"Another good read - one of the crop of psychological thrillers being talked up these days.It has been likened to Gone Girl and there are similarities with the structure of the book (and the subject matter to an extent).The story is told in first person but from 3 differing participants' viewpoints. Each chapter alternates between these viewpoints (sometimes only switching between 2 of the narrators in consecutive chapters though) and some of the timelines are slightly different - but they converge towards the end.One of the main characters (Rachel Watson) comes across as not very likeable as she has a drink problem and for that reason (as she herself admits) her recollection of events is unreliable so you're never quite sure when reading her bits if it is truthful. In fact, with reading the three different narrators you generally get that person's view of the ""truth"" rather than necessarily what actually happened.As is usual with these books, there is a twist towards the end (can't say too much without revealing it) and the differing viewpoints converge as the story reaches a climax. Part way through this I was inclined to give it a 4-star rating (marked down because of the unsympathetic Rachel) but as you can see, I ended up giving it 5 stars because the tension and thrills picked up in the final 15% of the book and you also realise that Rachel was being manipulated throughout most of the book, so she garnered more sympathy by the end of it.I can imagine this book being picked up for film or TV adaptation at some point."
1044,Liz Cipro,So good! Literally couldn't stop reading and couldn't figure out the ending . Crazy characters that you hate/ worry about and lots of open ended things that don't make any sense until they all make sense in the end. Totally suspenseful and worth the read .
1045,Cortney Durbin,"This book, this book. I admit that I loved it, but I almost feel twisted for loving it. Literally every character was an absolutely loathsome human being. There was not one ""likable"" character in the whole story, and yet I liked them all. I appreciated their flaws, even with how utterly horrific they were. It's obvious to me that the author either knows a great deal about psychology, psychological disorders, and addictions, or else she did her research very well. I feel as though she created characters with flaws that almost all of us can relate to in one way or another. Maybe not so extreme as the characters were, but relatable nonetheless. Addiction, vanity, dishonesty, promiscuity, anger management issues, attachment disorders. It was all present. And I found myself totally repulsed and simultaneously totally engrossed by it all. It was a worthy read, I feel. I'd recommend it to my friends. "
1046,Mary,"When I read a few reviews prior to reading this book, I immediately became excited that it was compared to Gone Girl. I've never read the book because I saw the movie first - big mistake - but I still enjoyed the movie! At first, I thought Rachel might have been behind Megan's death. Then I thought, ""that's way too easy."" As the story focused on Anna and Tom, I knew one of them was behind the murder. I wanted so badly to think it was Anna because I couldn't stand her! Lol. The characters in this story were so messed up and troublesome, but I think that's what made it awesome. Definitely a great thriller! "
1047,Meg,"I couldn't put this book down. I have seen reviews that compare it to Gone Girl, but I found it much more appealing. Unlike Gone Girl, initially unlikable characters became more likable, or at least understood and believable, as the story unfolded. Not only was it a true thriller - a page-turning experience unlike one I've read in a long while - but it also brings attention to the various reasons why people sink into depression, turn to alcohol, and become obsessed with what is going wrong in their lives to the point of self-destruction. A strong theme in the book dealt with the effects that abuse has on people, and how often the ""silent"" type of emotional abuse can be the most destructive of all. I look forward to the next thriller by this author. "
1048,Jennifer Mcmahon,"This was a fantastic book recommended by a fantastic reading friend, Kate Harris. The story is ever evolving and is entwined in the lives of several people. The main character is the girl on the train but what she sees as real life and what actually is true is what makes this an interesting read. I was not in the mood for reading but once I started I could not put this book down. This books draws you in and you just want to know what happens next but what actually happens is not what you could predict and the more you read the more intrigued you become. "
1049,Wynter Dunahee,unbelievable book! I probably experienced every emotion available to the human body. I just have no words how incredible this book was for many reasons.
1050,Samantha Pron,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. This book was referred to me by numerous people and I had a hard time putting it down. Although it was a tad bit easy to figure out who the killer was, I was taken through twists and turns that made me rethink my decision constantly. I did get pissed at Rachel numerous times because I couldn't understand her stupidity but she was believable despite her actions. I will pass it along and start referring this book to my friends. "
1051,Gemma Birkett,"This was a much faster paced and creepier Gone Girl. A book completely filled with secrets and lies, no one in this book can be trusted. With three very messed up and complicated women at the heart of this novel, the story instantly has a great amount of depth and deception. I was drawn into this book very quickly and wanted to know more instantly, it was a real page turner. This was a very cleverly crafted thriller, with all loose ends tied up, I was left guessing right up until the killer was revealed which I really enjoyed. I loved the constant guessing and mistrusting of each character chapter by chapter.I felt the ending was slightly flat compared to the rest of the book, the rest was full of suspense and drama, and my opinion constantly changed on the characters throughout. After everything was revealed I thought something much more dramatic would happen. I don’t know why but I expected more, saying this, I would definitely read another Paula Hawkins. "
1052,Kristy Daniels,Just finished this book and oh my forget 5 stars!! 50 stars!!! These characters will be on my mind for a bit.
1053,M.D.,That. Was amazing. 
1054,Lia Correia,"Um espectáculo! Completamente inebriante. Uma leitura que nos agarra do princípio ao fim e em modo crescendo :-) Personagens magníficas e reais, uma história super bem desenvolvida e coerente e uma forma de escrever fantástica. "
1055,Alex Wilkinson,"I finished this book in one afternoon. It's been a while since Ive devoured a book like that. I saw this book had 38,000 reviews on Amazon and decided to give it a shot. It captured me from the first page and I was hooked. I love that feeling. The story twists and turns but it takes you right along for the ride. Fast enough to keep your constant interest but not too fast that you can't keep up. You never quite know where the story is taking you. Paula Hawkin's debut novel was exceptional. I see a movie deal for this book in her future. "
1056,Marilyn,"A great read. And a good ending, was honestly not expecting the killer to be that person. Glad I saw this one and picked it up to read."
1057,Debbie White,"I absolutely loved this thriller! I give it a five thumbs up and more!! The plot is weaved into the story in such a way as to keep you reading as fast as you can till the very end! I loved the way the author uses the people she sees while on the train as part of the story. Very imaginative as we all tend to do this about others from time to time- thinking of how their lives are compared to our own. The writer really intrigues us with the plot between the imaginary characters that she creates while on the train and the Real characters- what a difference! Also her drinking problem adds to the mystery of this book, and what she really Did when she was drinking. Did she perhaps commit the murder in a drunken state? What did she really do with the red haired stranger? All-in- all I really enjoyed it, and I could certainly see this as a great movie plot! Can't wait to read another suspense story from Paula Hawkins!! Bravo!!!"
1058,Debby,"This is one of those books that I found it hard to like any of the characters; however, the story is amazingly well told and I couldn't put the book down. "
1059,Trish Toompuu,A page turner. I read it in 2 days 
1060,Accio Reviews,"[Full review on my blog, 'Accio Reviews'!]Wow. Wow. Wow.This is one of those cases where I will be struggling to put together a coherent review.Not only because this is a brilliant book but also due to the fact that I believe you should go into the reading of it as blind as possible and I don't want to give too much away.This story is told through three different points of view: Rachel, our protagonist, and two other women (which I won't be getting into much detail of who they are, since, you know, spoilers). Two of them are concurrent as for timeline (at the beginning of each 'chapter' there is an indication of what day it is to help you keep up), while the third begins about one year earlier. As you read the book you should take this into account, because every detail matters and that look into the past is filled with clues and a privileged perspective into the characters at play.The biggest compliment I can give this book is that it was the most brilliantly executed 'show, don't tell' that I have read in a long time. You get to know all of these people by the little things they do or say, and all of their personalities slowly form in front of your eyes, instead of having paragraphs and paragraphs of exposition just to get that out of the way. As a writer, I will definitely be looking back to it as an inspiration.I did, however, end up the tiniest bit disappointed because I guessed what the ending was going to be halfway through reading the book, but since I rarely get these things right I just kept waiting for a plot twist that never came. It doesn't hurt at all my rating of it because it still was an amazing read and a great, insightful look into first impressions and what people really are behind closed doors. You think you know someone but you might be sorely, dangerously mistaken.For fans of Gone Girl and Before I Go to Sleep, this thriller will keep you at the edge of your (possibly train?) seat until the very last page!"
1061,Amanda McGill,"A little bit about me: I love March Madness. I especially love the opening Thursday and Friday games...ahh the upsets! I enter multiple pools and cheer on random college teams that I know next to nothing about. Now how does this relate to The Girl on the Train. Well this past weekend was the opening weekend of March Madness...32 games within 2 days starting on Thursday. And how did I spend my Friday night...reading The Girl on the Train. That's right. During one of the greatest sporting events of the year, I was curled up on the couch reading Girl on the Train. I just couldn't put this book down! There was the mystery aspect that I really enjoyed, but the thriller part just hooked me. I figured out the mystery about half way through, but the ending and the tension just kept going and I couldn't tear myself away. The characters were flawed, but at times I just wanted to be friends with them and be there for them. Overall, I loved it. As a fan of thrillers, I would suggest this novel to those who love thrillers as well, especially Before I Go to Sleep."
1062,Stacey,"This was so much fun to read! While the ""twist"" at the end wasn't nearly as ""twisty"" as the jacket blurbs would have had me believe, it was quite a ride to get there. The main characters (and there are a handful) are delightfully, interestingly damaged - each in their own way. The story is doled out - in bits and pieces, and not chronologically - by the three women. Every one is unreliable. But, in a major difference from Gone Girl (to which this is being compared), unreliable does not mean unlikeable or unsympathetic. I liked these characters...well, most of them. Hurray Paula Hawkins, for creating such compelling characters and then setting them in such a roller coaster of a story, and then keeping such precise control of them. If you liked Gone Girl, read this. If you didn't like Gone Girl, read this anyway - it's much more satisfying. Just make sure you have a free afternoon when you start. You're not going to want to put this one down. "
1063,Aleksandra Jaric,"One of the best books I've read! It is a fast, nail biting exciting read that walks the reader through emotional roller coasters of life. I don't want to include spoilers b/c it would ruin the read. All I can say is that Paula Hawkins is my new fave author!!!"
1064,Sommer Marsden,"Wowza. I loved this book. Read it very fast considering my current schedule. It's kinda dark, kind of confusing at times, but the confusion is intentional and propels the story at lightning speed. I always felt that I had one foot in the truth and one foot in the ether. A masterfully written story, in my humble opinion. The ending is a doozy and though it was likened to Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn (a fave author of mine), I think I actually liked this better. The characters are endearingly unlikeable. The plot dark and muzzy and almost dreamlike at times. I'll definitely be picking up Paula Hawkins future works based on this novel. I highly recommend it. "
1065,Mayte,4.5 stars 
1066,Moriartyandherbooks,"I read this book in under 2 days, so one day basically. My favorite thriller of the year, right up there with Gone Girl. It's impossible to put down! If you're looking for something to get you out of a reading slump then this is it!These characters are all terrible in their own way. I would NOT want to be friends with any of them :) but at the end of the book I came to appreciate the strength and determination of the female characters."
1067,Catherine Casey,"7th and 8th graders: This probably isn't for you. I doubt I'd want my middle schooler reading about this. It's mature and deals with alcoholism, murder, and sexual themes. However, parents of students: what a ride this book was! At first it was a little slow, like a train chugging away from the station. Eventually, the pacing picked up. You love to hate Rachel until, miraculously, everything changes. I loved what a complex relationship she holds with those around her: her judgmental roommate, her ex-husband and his new wife, Megan and Megan's husband, Scott. I also was tragically invested in Megan's story, feeling myself root for her all while assuming the worst. Read it. Love it. "
1068,Brandi Diamond,"Disturbing, maddening- great original story. I plowed through it!"
1069,Alyson Larrabee,"Like I said before, it was a little like Gone Girl, but there was a train. None of the characters was very likable so it was hard sometimes to care what happened to them. Then Rachel, the protagonist, nosed out ahead of the pack and displayed both ingenuity and courage. I like the way the story was told in the voices of the three women and this way of telling the story became very significant in the end. (I won't say any more about it because I don't want to spoil any surprises.) I was sad to finish it because the plot picked up speed near the end and I couldn't put it down. The life lesson learned in the end is, ""Just like the horse, after you fall down, you have to get back on the train."""
1070,Ana Luisa,"http://viv-omundoencantadodoslivros.b...Antes de dar a minha opinião, gostaria de agradecer à TopSeller por me ter dado a oportunidade de ler este livro ainda antes de sair no mercado. Foi uma oportunidade fantástica e a qual espero que se volte a repetir. Já conhecia os ARC (Advanced Reading Copy) através de outros blogues estrangeiros e verificar que as nossas editoras começam a desenvolver o mesmo tipo de atividades deixa-me muito feliz.Agora, em relação ao livro…OHMEUDEUS!!!!!Este foi um livro completamente alucinante. Acho que, cada vez que fizer uma viagem de comboio, nunca mais irei olhar para as casas à beira da linha da mesma forma. Uma palavra para o descrever: Viciante! E, por mais que procure, não encontre uma única parte em que possa dizer mal da história ou dos seus personagens.Na minha opinião, Paula Hawkins criou uma história fantástica e que nos prende desde a primeira página. Sendo que a conjunção entre essa historia e o mistério que envolve vão-se tornando, ao longo do livro, cada vez mais envolventes e fazendo com que o leitor se sinta mais e mais absorvido pelo que se está a passar. O que posso dizer é que a leitura acaba por ser feita de uma forma quase compulsiva, em que o leitor quase não consegue parar de ler e a vontade de saber o que se vai passar a seguir vai aumentando a um ritmo completamente alucinante.Para aqueles que ainda não sabem, o livro estará à venda a partir do dia 8 de Junho. Não queiram perder este comboio, comprem o livro e entendam da melhor forma tudo aquilo que tenho estado a dizer. Acreditem que não se irão arrepender!"
1071,Sammeh,"I read fluffy wuffy, sweet kitten like books usually (chick lit) or Ooooh vampires! Werewolves! you get my gist...This was nothing like that,this is nothing like any of the books I like. In fact ""thriller"" would usually make me go nope! Not into things like that, but this one...this one has changed my mind. This book kept me absolutely hooked, it wasn't scary in a cover my ears and sing a disney tune it was scary in a ooooh this feels eerie but whats going to happen next! I spent my day wondering what was going to happen until I could get back to it! Rachel gets the same train every single day of her life,she goes past the same peoples houses she watches everyday who are sitting outside eating breakfast she begins to imagination what their lives are like and what they do and how they feel. They are the perfect lives. Something she does not.Are they really all that perfect though? Rachel witnesses something and informs certain people of that something. Has she done the right thing? or has she done more harm than good? "
1072,Sofia_reads,"Sin palabras, este libro arrasa todo lo que tiene en su camino, al igual que un tren.El final, inesperado.Sin duda alguna, el mejor libro que leí este 2015."
1073,Cathy,Loved this book. Could not put it down.
1074,Judie Parks,Fantastic storyline and fast read!!
1075,Paulette Eister,"75% through this book. Was a slow start for me in getting into this book. Have so many different feelings going through me while reading this book. There's a dark side to the story that gives me a very weird feeling that I can't explain. I feel so bad & sad at the same time for Rachel & Megan. And I myself am thankful for my normal ""boring"" life. I already know part of the ending of the story because I peeked. It's a surprise, no spoilers here! I'm admittedly not a fast reader, but I'm trying to read this book as fast as I can. Can't wait to get to the end (even if I do sort of know the ending). A must- read!!!"
1076,Lindsey Rey,"This was incredibly good! It dealt with issues like domestic abuse, alcoholism, and not being able to get pregnant in a way that felt very raw to me. It was a little slow to start, but once the main plot started it really took off and I was completely engrossed. Highly recommend to those who enjoy thrillers!"

1078,Franzi303,"Das Cover:Zu sehen ist der Titel des Buches in einem verschwimmenden Weiß. Im Hintergrund ist ein Zugfenster mit dem leichten Umriss einer Frau zu sehen, was den fahrenden Zug symbolisieren soll. Ich finde, es ist ein recht ‚hektisches‘ Cover, das aber auch zur Geschichte passt. Schön ist auch, dass das Cover vom Original übernommen wurde.Die Geschichte:Jeden Tag fährt Rachel mit dem 08:04 Uhr Zug von Ashbury nach Euston. Und so gut wie jedes Mal sieht sie das Pärchen von Haus Nr. 15, Jess und Jason, wie sie die beiden nennt, auf der Terrasse. Rachel stellt sich vor, dass beide zusammen eine perfekte Beziehung führen. Doch eines Tages sieht sie Jess einen anderen Mann küssen. Rachel ist schockiert, doch es kommt noch schlimmer: Einen Tag später ist Jess, die in Wirklichkeit Megan heißt, spurlos verschwunden! Rachel lässt diese Sache keine Ruhe und mischt sich in die Ermittlungen ein. Denn Megan scheint keine Vorzeigevergangenheit gehabt zu haben. Doch welcher Polizist glaubt schon einer alkoholabhängigen arbeitslosen Frau, die ihren Ex-Mann und deren neue Frau stalkt und selbst einmal in der Straße des Verbrechens gewohnt hat?Meine Meinung:‚Girl on the Train‘ wurde mir von einer Arbeitskollegin und Freundin empfohlen, sodass sie es mir auslieh, damit ich diesen spannenden Thriller auch entdecken konnte. Ich hatte schon ein bisschen was von dem großen Hype gehört, der um dieses Buch gemacht wurde und war sehr gespannt. Los geht es mit Rachel, die jeden Tag um die gleiche Zeit mit dem Zug fährt. Sie entrüstet sich, als sie sieht, dass der weibliche Part ihres täglichen Vorzeigepaares einen anderen küsst und am Tag darauf spurlos verschwunden ist. Natürlich wird nach ihr gesucht und auch Rachel meint, etwas dazu beitragen zu können, um Megans Mörder zu fassen. Leider ist sie nicht unbedingt glaubwürdig, denn sie trinkt gerne ein Glas (oder eine Flasche) zu viel, benimmt sich dann wie eine Verrückte und hat Aussetzer/Blackouts.Die Kapitel sind mal aus Rachels, mal aus Megans und mal aus Annas, der neuen Frau von Rachels Ex-Mann Tom geschrieben. Auch sind immer Datumsangaben (z. B. Freitag, 12. Juli 2013) sowie Tageszeiten (morgens oder abends) angegeben, was mir das Lesen am Anfang erschwerte, aber im Verlauf der Geschichte wichtig war. Auch wenn ich nicht so wirklich der Thriller-Fan mehr bin, hat dieses Buch mich absolut begeistern können. Ich habe immer mitgerätselt, wer der Mörder sein könnte und war geschockt, als immer wieder Teile von Megans Vergangenheit enthüllt wurden. Nach und nach setzten sich die Puzzleteile zusammen und ergaben ein großes Ganzes. Für mich war ‚Girl on the train‘ wirklich ein sehr spannender Thriller, den ich verschlungen habe. Einfach top!Meine Bewertung:Mit ‚Girl on the Train‘ hat Paula Hawkins einen super spannenden Thriller-Debütroman erschaffen, der mich bis zur letzten Seite gefesselt hat. Nichts ist so, wie es scheint. Fesselnd, spannend und überraschend. Absolut verdiente fünf Sterne!"
1079,Theresa Alan,"What I liked about this book was that the narrators weren’t entirely reliable or likeable. One of my favorite lines comes from Rachel, who is battling alcoholism. She says, “How much better life must have been for jealous drunks before emails and texts and mobile phones, before all these electronics and traces it leaves.” The first person narrators don’t have distinctive voices, so if you put the book down in the middle of a chapter, it will take you a second to figure out who is talking (you can figure out if it’s Rachel if she’s talking about how much she wants a drink, for example.) All in all though, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and will recommend it to friends because I couldn’t wait to come back to it to find out what happened, and I wasn’t disappointed."
1080,Christina Marino,AwesomeDefinitely recommend. Thoughts it was a great book look forward to movie coming out. Lost a lot of sleep staying up to read.
1081,Jamie,"Dear Paula Hawkins,Please make this a movie. It would be fantastic. Sincerely,Couldn't Put It DownI read this book in 2 days because I couldn't put it down. The Girl on the Train begins with Rachel, who it seems, has her life together. She goes to and from work every day on the commuter train. We soon find out she's not quite got it all together and is an alcoholic who suffers from blackouts. Then there's Megan. Megan's a restless unhappy insomniac who just can't be content with her perfect husband. Finally, is Anna. Anna has the perfect life and family. When we begin to find out how these lives are interwoven we're plunged into a rabbit hole there is just no getting out of. I highly recommend this book."
1082,Dani DeGarso,"Jaw dropping!! Mind blowing!!! Not what in was expecting at all!!! So worth every penny I spent to read this book. I'm not going to give any spoilers but, I will say that if you try to figure it out you won't just let the story flow, and don't judge this book by the cover or you will miss out an amazing story!"
1083,Liz Haefele,"I could not put this one down! Paula Hawkins is a very creative writer, weaving a story with twists and turns that are original. While I see the parallels with Gone Girl and agree that the genre is the same, the story line is very different. The main character, Rachel, is an alcoholic and she is a bit crazy, but the reader can empathize with her pain and neediness because she is lost and not unkind (could not empathize with any characters in Gone Girl). You just want to shake her throughout the book, and want her to snap to her senses! Rachel feels that she is acting in good faith, which makes her likable, even though her involvement in the plight of Scott and Megan is way over the top. Paula Hawkins method of revealing key information over the course of the book is the true art of this story in my opinion. She continued to surprise me throughout, although after each surprise I thought to myself ""well, I should not have been surprised by that..."" This book is such a treat, you don't want to miss it. I've already lent my copy out and have promised it to a couple of other friends because I enjoyed it so much!"
1084,Ida,Minner meg om Gone Girl. Creepy og underholdende. En bok fylt med triste skjebner. Tror knapt det finnes en eneste stabil person i denne boken. Synes Hawkins skriver godt. Jeg lot meg hvertfall rive med.
1085,Contessa,"I read a sample of this book when it first started getting popular and I couldn't get into it. The sample was the first 20 or so pages and I was bored out of my mind so I passed on buying it. I read some other reviews that were pretty critical. Some have said the book is a waste of time others have said its a tedious glimpse into the lives of some messed up characters and one review said that if you REALLY like to read you'll HATE this book. That being said I gave it a second chance and I'm so glad I did. It went on sale one day and I let my friend know since she had expressed an interest in reading it. She texted me a few days later gushing about how great it was. So, with nothing else on my reading list at the moment, I tried it again and suffered through the first 20 or so pages. I must say I really enjoyed it. The mystery kept me guessing until almost the very end and the prose flowed really well. I mean, its not Hemingway or anything, but it is a well-written -- well paced thriller that's perfect for the quickly coming chilly fall nights."
1086,Sabrina,Changing my review because the more you sit with this book the more you realize how good it actually is and i think its one of my favorites now
1087,Kim Starks,I really liked this book. A lot of twists and turns! 
1088,Barbara Justiniano,A good who done it type story that had me guessing for most of the book. 
1089,Mary Ess,"I read this book in 24 hours because I couldn't put it down. I had to figure it out and I'm usually pretty good at solving before the author reveals but this kept me guessing right up to the end. Someone wrote that they didn't like any of the characters, I liked them all. Very believable which is part of its magic. I will never feel the same about my train rides again."
1090,Brianne Whitley,"Holy. Cow. What an incredible, edge of your seat kind of book. This book reminded me somewhat of Gone Girl, but it was not as vulgar. If you love thrillers or mystery books that continue to keep you guessing then you should read this book! It was incredible! The first couple chapters were confusing for me, but I finally figured it out. Pay attention to the dates and also who the chapter is focusing on, hint: the name of the chapter is the name of the person that chapter focuses on. :) Great book! I loved reading this and would recommend it to anyone who loves a little psychological thrill!"
1091,Mariesa Negosanti,"There's little to stay except that I was absorbed in this book as soon as I picked it up. While I understand it has a similar plot line to Gone Girl, this book is far superior. I couldn't get past the first 40 pages of Gone Girl. Hawkins carefully intertwines the story line of three emotionally vulnerable women who are able to overcome the abusive man they once loved. It's a roller coaster of a story told through enticing writing. "
1092,Cinco Garotas Exemplares,"Apesar de ler pouco do gênero presentemente, um bom thriller psicológico sempre me fascina. E quando li a sinopse do livro A garota no trem, ele instantaneamente me chamou a atenção. E não seria para menos, quando finalmente o peguei em mãos, devorei em dois dias.Como sintetizar tanta genialidade num enredo? Como resumir meus sentimentos em tanta verdade e profundidade numa narração?Vamos lá!!!!O livro é narrado em primeira pessoa e é alternado entre três personagens chaves. Um quebra cabeça muito bem calculado desde a primeira página. E eu amei cada nova descoberta, cada pedacinho dessa genial charada muito bem harmonizada.Paula Hawkins me ganhou pra sempre. Me apaixonei profundamente pela escrita dessa autora tão surpreendente.O que mais me encantou foi a forma que a autora narra. Não existe mundinho perfeito a caminho. Você se depara com a realidade, a do vizinho, a sua! É tudo tão real, tão íntimo. Eu senti o que ela descreve, eu reconheci a fraqueza, a dor, a fragilidade do ser humano. Eu captei a sensação do vício, não porque eu me coloquei no lugar, mas porque eu também tenho debilidades; todos nós temos e Paula Hawkins foi extraordinariamente primorosa ao atingir o ponto exato da impotência humana.“Uma para tristeza, duas para alegria, três para menina. Três para menina. Fico empacada nas três. Não consigo passar disso. Minha cabeça está repleta de sons, minha boca, repleta de sangue. Três para menina. Posso ouvir as aves, as pegas-rabudas — estão rindo, debochando de mim, um crocitar estridente. Um bando. Mau agouro. Posso vê-las agora, negras contra o sol. Não as aves, outra coisa. Alguém está vindo. Alguém está falando comigo. Veja só. Veja só o que você me obrigou a fazer.”Por mais que alguns personagens sejam dignos de raiva, as vezes até nojo, eu não consegui odiá-los completamente. Porque eles são tão, tão humanos! Eu senti raiva sim, repulsa, claro! Mas em determinados momentos, senti muita pena, é tudo muito cru, verdadeiro e me vi completamente envolvida.Quando eu acabei a leitura, fui pesquisar sobre o livro e descobri que “ A garota no trem, já vendeu quatro milhões de exemplares e foi traduzido para 44 línguas. O livro está na lista dos mais vendidos do “New York Times” há 27 semanas, e no Reino Unido derrubou o recorde alcançado há seis anos por “O símbolo perdido”, de Dan Brown” (Fonte: Jornal O Globo). E a melhor notícia? A história vai virar filme!!!!!!Simplesmente ADORO quando isso acontece!!!Preferi não citar os personagens, não quero sinalizar nenhum tipo de spoiler. E eu SUPER indico que você leia. É uma leitura fluida e viciante, vale muito a pena MESMO!"
1093,Esha Dickson,"I purchased this book back when it was released, and only now have I gotten around to reading it. I really wish I had read it sooner, it was so good! I don't normally read creepy books like this, but I want to delve further into the genre after reading it.The story is told from three perspectives, Rachel, Anna, and Megan, and all three of them are screwed up, some more than others. There is a lot of mystery surrounding them and their motives, so much so that you aren't sure if you can trust them. As a result, I became wary of everyone, even the secondary characters, and it made the story much more interesting and exciting. About halfway through I thought I knew what the outcome was going to be, but it turned out I was very wrong. I could never have picked the ending and was completely shocked when all was revealed. The characters in this story are believable and well developed, the plot is exciting and interesting, and Paula Hawkins is able to grip you right from the first page, and never let you go, even after you finish the last. It has shocking twists and turns throughout, and the multiple perspectives adds to the mystery and suspense that appears throughout the novel.I highly recommend The Girl on the Train, for anyone who loves mystery and suspense novels, as well as people who want to delve deeper into this genre. Paula Hawkins has created a fantastic novel, and I can't wait to see what she does next!"
1094,mlady_rebecca,"What a wild and crazy ride that was. Picked this up after reading they were making it into a movie and my favorite actor was rumored for one of the male leads. So, yes, I sat and figured out who was who before reading. Didn't really know the other actors, so just Jared Leto stuck in my head. I could see him in the role. Ensemble piece. Three female leads, two male. In the book the females alternate being the POV character. Full chapters, so there was no real confusion. Although, a nitpick, the chapters really needed to be numbered, not just labeled Rachel, Megan, or Anna.Rachel is the titular girl on the train. On her morning and evening commute she passes the house she used to own with her ex Tom and his new wife Anna. She also passes a home where an attractive couple, Megan and Scott live. Rachel creates a story for the attractive couple who she dubs Jess and Jason. Turns them into the perfect couple with the perfect life. Meanwhile Megan is looking at the trains passing by, wishing to be one of the people traveling off on a new adventure. Jared is supposed to be playing Scott. The characters are all gloriously flawed. No one has the life they want. Possible spoilers, depending how sensitive you are....Something happens to Megan. She goes missing. And Rachel thinks she knows something from her train window impression of Megan and Scott's life. So she inserts herself into the investigation and befrending Scott. When Megan turns up dead, Rachel does her best to defend her new friend Scott, but her fantasies, lies, and drunken misrememberings catch up to her. While Rachel's story -- and later Anna's story -- move along the present, we get most of Megan's story in a parallel flashback. *****As for the movie:Rachel Watson -- Emily BluntTom Watson (Rachel's ex) -- Chris EvansAnna Watson (Tom's new wife) -- Rebecca Ferguson Megan Hipwell -- Haley Bennett Scott Hipwell -- Jared Leto "
1095,Harry,"Instead many of other reviews, this book deserve 5 stars. It is a thriller that keeps you connected with the story and with the characters. By keeping all lines of possibilities on the events, despite the modest narrative, the book manages to build a web, with facts that will gradually linking. Of course, if you read the book with great expectations, they will end up being broken. It's not the kind of book that changes lives: a ordinary history, common characters, murder, many suspects, unpredictable course. The greatest merit of this book is a fluid writing that gives good reading pace. The greatest problem is the book is the attempt to narrate the fact's by first person, with each chapter corresponding to a different character. I took long time to realize that, and all narrators have almost the same point of view."
1096,Carlie,I really didn't know what to expect when I started reading this book. I thought it was going to be a mystery about a girl who saw something while riding the train. It was not that simple. It was definitely more than a story about a girl on a train and what she saw. A reader may think they have the ending figured out before the end of the book but that is simply not the case. This book is an intense thriller where clues are not what they seem and neither are the characters. I honestly thought I would take my time with this book but I could not put it down. 
1097,Joanne,"Wonderful thriller that keeps you guessing right to the end.Rachel: alcoholic, ex-wife of TomAnna:Tom's new wifeMegan: babysat for Tom & AnnaScott: married to MeganCathy: Rachel's room mateRachel fantasises about the people in a house that she can see from the train as she travels to work (and continues to travel this route after she's fired). It's just down from the house that she used to live in with Tom, who now shares it with Anna and their child, Evie.Megan goes missing and Rachel's fantasies lead her to Scott. Eventually her head clears and she starts seeing the whole picture. Tom was having an affair with Megan, who became pregnant, and he kills her. Rachel realizes how controlling and violent Tom really is. After a struggle with him where he nearly kills her, she rams a cork screw into his neck in self-defence.Anna makes sure he'll be good and dead.Excellent read."
1098,Kayla Twedt,"Such a thriller. I read this book in 3 days, and could have read it in one sitting if I had the time. Paula Hawkins keeps you guessing the entire time, and never leaves you fully trusting any of the characters. You won't be bored with this one."
1099,Joanna,Thought I had it figured out several times. It turns out I didn't. Well done trickery.
1100,Sharon Honeycutt,"I loved this book. I loved the fact that it was dark, that the narrator was unreliable, and yet I rooted for her. She wasn't so despicable--or pathetic--that I couldn't care about her. The suspense was well crafted. I was guessing for a long time. I did figure it out before it was revealed, but that didn't spoil anything for me because I still wasn't sure how it would all play out. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes dark suspenseful thrillers."
1101,Alison,"This book is written from three different viewpoints, the perspectives of 3 different women whose lives are connected. The first part of the book switches chapters between two of the women with the third coming in a little later. At the beginning it is not entirely clear how the main two female characters are connected and chapter-by-chapter the connections are revealed. I felt a touch frustrated about a third of the way through because of the deliberate confusion and lack of clarity created by the switching between characters, but this resolved and the story picked up pace and in the end I was anxious to read at every opportunity to find out what was going on and how everyone was connected.I liked how all the different threads weave between the characters and despite none of them being particularly likeable, and all of them being very flawed, the characters were interesting and compelling. The climax is superb and I really loved the last page.An excellent psychological thriller that I would thoroughly recommend!"
1102,D. Gianika Murphy,"5. no maybe 10. or 100. IDK.I. LOVE. THIS. BOOK. SO. MUCH.My heart will always have a space for this kind of book. I mean, I love this genre so much. People might say that they don't like it compared to Gone Girl, but I don't care. I fucking don't care, this genre will always have a space in my heart.Now about the book. This book has 3 POVs which are Rachel, Anna and Meghan. The plot is back and forth which makes me a bit confused because I didn't notice the date at first but after get used to it, I wasn't confused anymore.Idk about you, but I've already felt a thrilling sensation since the begining of the book. I can feel myself as Rachel eventhough I've never had a husband ok that's weird. I always feel the excitement when I turned the pages one by one. When I finished a chapter, I didn't want to put this down! I didn't want to stop reading it, I enjoyed it. But again. I'm a super duper truper slow reader. Although I found a book so thrilling, interesting and exciting I just can't finish it less than a week but trust me, if you love psychological thriller mystery suspense like me, you need to read this at least once in your lifetime.Your slow reader,Dyn "
1103,Louise,"When deciding between 4 or 5 stars, I realised that I had to award the full 5 because when I started reading the book I loath the main character so much that I thought there would be no way she could be redeemed. I even wanted to rate the book a measly 2.5 stars just because the main character was so ugh - I also nearly stopped reading the book too... I only continued because the writing was great and the story was compelling. You wanted to know what happened, despite the deeply flawed main character. I was so glad to be proven wrong and to develop sympathy for Rachel and that she became likeable in the end. If she was a real person I would want her to succeed. Subsequently, I hit the 5 stars. It's a great read."
1104,Kayla Gansauer,Seriously one of the best books I've read in a long time! Suspenseful and intriguing! Couldn't put it down! Highly recommend it 
1105,عبدالعزيز المحيني,بلغة أنثوية فارهة سردت بولا هوكينز روايتها الرائعة عن أحاسيس المرأة واحتياجها إلى الرجل وحماقاتها دون ذلك.. القصة جميلة، والأسلوب شاعري إلى حد الخيال، حلقت معها بعيدا في اللغة التي أتقن المترجم السوري الحارث النبهان استدراجها إلى المعاني. القصة عن فتاة تركب القطار مرتين يوميا وتمر بيتها القديم الذي كانت تسكنه مع طليقها وتسترجع جزءا من حياتها في كل مرة تمر عليه، وفتاة أخرى تشعر بأن الحياة سخيفة. الأسلوب السردي رائع لدرجة أن القارئ لن يتوقف عن القراءة بعد الصفحة الثانية
1106,Gerri Leen,"If you're like me, you're sick of books being hailed as the next Gone Girl. Because a. they usually aren't like that book in any way that matters and b. they often aren't any good, period. And then comes The Girl on the Train **happy sigh** and you say, ""Oh my God, this time they weren't lying just to get sales!"" It's not often that I sit and read. I mean an undivided, sit down for a long period with no intention of doing anything but reading kind of thing, but I got about 75% of the way done with this and I just had to settle in for the long haul. And it was worth it. So worth it. At one point in the story, early on, I thought I was going to bail because of how some of the female protagonists (if anyone in this book is really that--I think the characters may all be antagonists LOL) were being portrayed. But after the fifty zillion twists to get to the end, I sat back and said, ""It all works."" And immediately I started trying to figure out how the hell you would film this baby. I'm sure she's sold the movie rights by now. If not, it won't be long.I hate to say more because I don't want to spoil the ride for others. Have fun, is all I can say, and good luck sussing this one out beforehand."
1107,Peytonrileysmommy,This book was really good! I liked it more than Gone Girl. 
1108,Camilla,"C’est un thriller, un roman à suspens que nous dévoile l’auteure. Dans la banlieue de Londres, nous suivons Rachel, qui chaque matin et soir prend le train pour Londres (à la même heure). Elle prend donc pour habitude d’observer une maison laquelle est habitée par un couple qu’elle nomma Jason et Jess, ce couple parfait à ses yeux.Cependant, un jour, Rachel découvre que l’homme se tenant prêt de Jason sur leur balcon n’est pas Jess… L’illusion de ce couple « parfait » tomberait à l’eau ?Peu après ceci, le journal indique qu’une femme : Megan Wipwell a disparu. Cette femme : Jess.Rachel est alors emmenée dans cette affaire : entre passé douloureux, présent trouble et futur inexistant, nous restons aux côtés de trois femmes : Rachel, Megan et Anna (la nouvelle femme de l’ex de Rachel).Que s’est-il réellement passé ? Megan avait-elle un amant ? Qui était cet homme à ses côtés ?Une disparition, une énigme à résoudre entourée d’autres problèmes de la vie comme l’amour, le divorce, l’alcool, ou encore le souhait de devenir mère…Un roman addictif qui tient ses promesses ! Un roman qui « nous fait tourner la tête » au sens positif, nous obligeant à vouloir découvrir nous aussi la vérité.Je conseille alors cette lecture aux amoureux de romans policiers mais aussi aux amoureux des livres tout simplement !"
1109,Kazimiera pendrey,T his has got to be just about the best book i have read so far this year. The plot was very original in fact i have never read a book quite like this before. was quite beautifully writen the plot was one that kept you guessing right to the last page i would recommend this book to any fans of thrillers or contemporary fiction 
1110,Cayleigh,"I put this book on my Favorites shelf, and it is a first for me because it is an audiobook and it is on my favorites because of that. I so much enjoyed the three voices of Rachel, Megan and Anna, and through them the voices of the other main characters. It was a little weird yet fascinating when characters overlapped between the women and I got to ""hear"" how this character felt like that one ""sounded"" or felt towards them. It was a new sensation for me, getting that inside look of someone from another person's pov from an auditory perspective. This is only the second book I've completely listened to and the first one with shifting perspectives with a different narrator for each one. I am thrilled with it! I will have to go back and read it one day, as the previous book I listened to I had read quite a few times already and had already connected to that way. The way this mystery pulls together in the end thrilled me, such winding and connecting but not where I expected. (Keep in mind though, if you are an avid mystery reader that hardly ever ever read true mystery type books). Easily the psychologist Dr.Kamal Abditch (last name might be off, but that is what it sounded like to me) was my favorite character...it was easy to fall in love with him from the one character's POV (view spoiler)[ Megan's  (hide spoiler)]. Mostly though, I loved how the book is like life in that in the end, we all turn into the same thing. In the end, each of the women have been put into the ""place"" of the other, walks in the proverbial shoes of the others...even if it burns them to do it. Especially the ending, that I liked the best, but don't want to spoil. (view spoiler)[ The end when Rachel has insomnia, like Megan. Though to an extent I feel like Rachel doesn't ""deserve"" the insomnia whereas a part of me totally felt like insomnia was something that Megan deserved. Though on the other hand Megan didn't at all, it was an accident that was handled wrong in all ways. An accident by a young girl, a young girl left without the mental/emotional support she needed before, during and after the baby.  (hide spoiler)] Definitely enjoyed and will recommend! "
1111,Monica,"Woah. This was so twisted but found myself engrossed with the characters and storyline the entire time. I had a hard time putting this book down. Lots of sad parts that made me think could realistically happen to someone. A few times there were predictable moments but I didn't care. Bravo, Paula Hawkins, this was a great debut novel and look forward to reading your next one."
1112,Deisy Fundora,"....UNA POR LA PENA DOS POR LA ALEGRIA TRES POR UNA CHICA......FENOMENAL ! TENGO QUE DECIRLO AL PRINCIPIO NO ME GUSTO MUCHO, PERO DESPUES FUE GRANDIOSO !!!"
1113,Diane Klajbor,"WOW, what a mystery. This is a warning to clear your day, or a couple of days to read this book. You won't want to do anything else but read it to the finish. A friend of mine calls books like this NCT - No Chores Today. This is definitely a NCT book. The story is told from three female narrators. You can't trust or believe any of them. There are hints and teasers dropped all through the book. I didn't figure out the ending ahead of time. There are already many reviews out there that will summarize the story for you, so I won't repeat all that here. There is much tension in the plot, the readers' sympathies go back and forth between characters. Run, don't walk to your nearest bookstore or library to pick up this book then clear your day for a thrilling read."
1114,Moira Sammut,What an intense book! I can easily say it was the one I enjoyed reading most in 2015 and it's a definite page-turner. The story is so intriguing and it made me think about the characters and the story all day. 
1115,Shana M. Garrity,I loved everything about this read. The women in the book are so relatable. Their thoughts mirror many of my own about life. There is so much more depth to this book than the reader can ever imagine from the start. I love that each chapter is narrated by one of the three main women. Awesome awesome read
1116,Annika,Wow!
1117,Nikki Havers,"Couldn't put the book down, A must read for anyone who likes thrillers."
1118,Francis M.,"This book, was a little boring in the beginning. I am not going to lie about this one, but i still had faith that this book was going to somehow rock my world, and it did. This is what i would call the biggest psychological crime book i have ever read thus far, not only is Rachel a a woman hurt by her husbands infidelity, but she also blanks out, drinks a lot amd from time to time pops up in front of her ex husbands house, either just to be there, or i have no idea, its just crazy. Her ex husband Tom, is a total jerk, at the end of the book, Megan, is also another one as well, there were soo much secrets, too much to write i dont want to spoil anything. Hahha. This book was awesome though"
1119,Dorottya,"I absolutely loved it. It was very refreshing to read about adults, not teenagers. I found it very easy to indetify with Rachel or Megan, mainly because of their depression I guess. I enjoyed the tiny plot twists, they were very smooth and elegant, preparing the whole story for the ultimate plot twist. I couldn't put down the book which wasn't the best because I had my exam so I should have focused on studying but what can you do when there is such a good book like this? I liked how Paula portrayed the addiction, how many forms it can how and what it is like to live with these obsessions. And I also loved that she showed that nothing is perfect that seems to be perfect, no relationship is as happy or easy as it seems to be. I really, really liked it. And my dad even picked up the book to read! (And I read it on the train so the joke has been made hahah)"
1120,Carolyn James,"""In the morning, I take the 8:04, and in the evening, I come back on the 17:56. That's my train. It's the one I take. That's the way it is.""If you haven't heard about this book yet, trust me within the next few months you will The Girl On The Train is a thriller whodunnit nail bitter similar to works like Gone Girl. I enjoyed this more then GG because it was much more multilayered. It all starts with train commuter Rachel seeing something out her train car window that unsettles her. This alone, depressed, alcoholic decides to do something about it and unwittingly puts herself in the middle of a murder investigation. Rachel is sure she knows something and is desperate to be apart of events bigger then her own life, so she keeps going back in hopes to jog her blackout, booze soaked memory. Did Rachel have anything to do with Meghan Hipwell's disappearance? Did she see who killed her? One way or another, she won't stop until she discovers the truth.Read this book! That's all I have to say! Read it! It's fantastic. I'm sure it'll only be a matter of time before we hear of a movie deal for this; it's riveting. "
1121,Alex,"This was a thrilling page turner that didn't reveal its twist until the vital moment in the plot. It has been compared to Gone Girl, but I would actually say this is a better novel. The characters are more ambiguous and less archetypes, the writing is more literary, and the twist is more convincing. Also, there isn't the horrible rape politics that Gone Girl turned into a major plot point. The buzz around this book is totally worth it. "
1122,Terry Turrell,"WOW! Very well written mystery! When I put the book down, I couldn't wait to get back to the story to find out what the next twist would be. I'm looking forward to reading more by this author."
1123,Tabitha Vohn,"The Girl on the Train was everything I'd hoped it would be. I was drawn in by the synopsis and by the reviews describing the author's Hitchcockian presentation of this thriller. The novel did not disappoint. The female leads are all sympathetic in their own way, particularly Rachel who, despite her alcoholism and self-deprecation, actually makes for a quite likeable heroine when compared with Megan and Anna. We first see these two women as pristine ideals (from Rachel's perspective); although, that veneer is soon stripped away through the women's personal narratives. Just as the bleaker facades of the other characters are revealed as the novel progresses, we see Rachel's sincerity, her compassion, and her desperate need to be loved radiate through her drunken stupors. In fact, Hawkins novel acts as a vehicle for us to be reminded that all individuals are multifaceted, with loveable and despicable attributes. The delivery of the story is impeccably executed. Hawkins allots us just enough information to keep us on edge, keep us guessing and second guessing (I particularly liked Rachel's flashbacks and Megan's ambiguous recounts). The whodunnit isn't hard to guess if you're paying attention, but you'll be pleased that it's not a knock-off or copycat of previously done gotcha-endings. And even though I had the whodunit about halfway through the novel, there were still enough little surprises along the way to keep me riddled with suspense. I read until my eyes refused to stay open, and this novel was a delightful distraction from life. Truly awesome stormy weather reading! I only wish Hitckcock were still living so that if it was made into a film, it would be done right! "
1124,Santiago Quirama,"Sin ninguna duda este libro a sido uno de los mejores que he leido en 2015. aunque no sea un libro lleno de personajes, es muy comodo de leer, la trama esta basada en como rachel a pesar de sus desorientaciones, y algunas lagunas mentales, intenta resolver el misterio que en el libro se desarrolla.Rachel tendra un impedimento muy grande a la hora de resolver el caso ya que tiene graves problemas con el alcohol, especialmente con el vino y el gin-tonic; esta presenció el misterio en el momento en el que sucedieron algunas cosas extrañas, pero gracias a que en este momento esta ebria, no recuerda mucho y a medida que avanza la historia va teniendo algunos flashbacks y con esto va conectando la historia.Creo que se merecia las 4 semanas que estuvo en los best sellers de new york times"
1125,My Inner Shelf,"Un Sonatine tout chaud tout frais, ça se mange sans faim. J’ai rarement été déçue par cet éditeur qui a du nez, du pif, du flair. La fille du train est une sacrée surprise.Rachel, divorcée, alcoolique, un peu enlaidie et moralement diminuée par sa dépendance, prend le train tous les jours pour se rendre à Londres. Matin et soir, le train s’arrête quelques instants devant la même maison. Le couple qui l’occupe fascine Rachel, qui s’invente une vie par procuration. Le jour où la femme disparaît, Rachel voit presque son monde imaginaire s’effondrer. Obsédée par ce couple et cette disparition inexpliquée, Rachel va descendre du train et s’immiscer dans cette drôle d’affaire, et ressasser par la même occasion son mariage raté.>La fille du train est une héroïne pas très glorieuse, diminuée par l’alcool, elle ne parvient pas à se détacher de son ancienne vie, n’a pas fait le deuil de son mariage. Pour se donner une raison de vivre, elle cherche à aider la Police dans son enquête mais fait preuve d’une grande maladresse dans toutes ses démarches, enchaîne les faux-pas. Rachel est l’archétype de la pauvre fille, et Paula Hawkins en fait une héroïne inhabituelle. La perfection apparente du couple qu’elle a idéalisé dans ses fantasmes se fissure sous ses yeux. La culpabilité, la victimisation, la violence psychologique au sein du couple et la dépendance sont habilement illustré. Rachel, la fille du train, Anna, la nouvelle épouse de son ex, et Megan, la disparue, expriment à tour de rôle leur vision du monde, avec leurs idées reçues, leurs préjugés, leur subjectivité. Trois visions différentes et parfois antagonistes malmènent le lecteur sur de fausses pistes, semant le doute.<Des personnages très humains, imparfaits sous le vernis d’un bonheur un peu trop clinquant, une intrigue bien ficelée, un roman sombre, efficace qui se lit vite et bien."
1126,Pupottina,"23 Blenheim Road""Non pretendere che io abbia la testa sulle spalle. Non posso. Non con te.""LA RAGAZZA DEL TRENO di Paula Hawkins è un thriller psicologico, tendente al giallo, con una struttura narrativa avvincente. La mente nasconde sempre moltissimi segreti. Anche quella della protagonista, Rachel, abituata a spiare le vite degli altri per non riflettere sulla propria. È sola. Divorziata. Ogni giorno prendere il treno: la mattina per andare, il pomeriggio per tornare dal lavoro a Londra. Il viaggio in treno è il suo momento preferito della giornata. Seduta accanto al finestrino, può osservare le vite degli altri e fantasticare. Nessuno la vede. Nessuno sa di essere spiato.In particolare, le piace spiare una coppia, un uomo e una donna, senza nome, che ogni mattina fanno colazione in veranda. Rachel dà loro dei nomi, si affeziona alla loro routine, che un tempo aveva anche lei, quando era sposata con il suo Tom. Per lei, quella coppia di estranei rappresenta la coppia perfetta dalla vita perfetta. La sua vita invece è tutt'altra cosa.L'apparente tranquillità su cui poggia la vita di Rachel viene rotta, una mattina, quando su quella veranda, vede qualcosa che non avrebbe dovuto vedere. Quel momento rappresenta per Rachel lo spartiacque tra la serenità e lo sconvolgimento totale. Rachel deve analizzare anche se stessa per comprendere ciò che ha visto e che non riesce più a ricordare.A narrare le vicende sono tre donne, Rachel, Anna e Megan, nei loro diari. Ogni giorno il lettore può scoprire cosa hanno fatto. I piani temporali, però, sono differenti, cioè non seguono l'ordine cronologico, ma distribuiscono eventi, elementi e dettagli per accrescere la curiosità di chi legge e scopre l'evolversi degli eventi, una pagina dopo l'altra, saltando da n periodo all'altro. Questo meccanismo cattura il lettore, man mano che vengono disseminati indizi e delineate situazioni. Una suspense crescente accompagna le azioni della protagonista, mentre cerca di ritrovare i tasselli mancanti alla sua memoria. Lei ha un grave problema di alcolismo e la mancanza di lucidità le crea confusione nei pensieri e nei ricordi. Rachel è una donna abbandonata da tutti, ma tenace nel voler salvaguardare l'ombra di perfezione che vede negli altri.Il ritmo della narrazione diviene man mano più incalzante fino allo sconvolgente colpo di scena. I misteri della mente umana sono tanti e non sempre chi appare equilibrato lo è davvero e viceversa."
1127,Fovilia Dewi,I finished reading it in two days and that only mean one thing: it's a keeper!
1128,Liz Fenton,loved. loved. LOVED!!!
1129,Kay Camden,"Couldn't put it down to the point of insanity. That is all.Actually, that's not all. I'm kind of amazed by what this book did. I see other reviewers are disgusted by the portrayal of women in this book, and I hear that. About halfway through, I was right there with those reviewers. Frustrated to have all these female characters who, if they're not crazy about having babies, they're crazy about not having babies, as if that's all that defines us. All we are. If babies make us crazy, and lack of babies makes us crazy, well, then I guess we're all crazy.But this line stayed in my head while I read on: ""...let's be honest: women are still only really valued for two things--their looks and their role as mothers.""And then I got to this one: ""I'm well aware there is no job more important than that of raising a child, but the problem is that it isn't valued.""I realized, the farther I got in, that all these limitations on the women is all done on purpose. That the theme here isn't how women naturally are, but how women become when we're treated as things, as birthing vessels, as objects to use and discard. What happens when we're lied to, betrayed, abused, abandoned. How we cope due to that. What we learn to do to avoid it. And how all too often we're working against each other, the world our enemy. And if we'd just team up, we could be so empowered.I guess that's the big picture I'm getting out of this. The other side to it is how strong and twisted and wildly entertaining this book is, how impossible it is to put down, how I stayed in an uncomfortable neck-pain position for a very long time because I couldn't interrupt my reading to move to the couch that was three feet away. How ""oh I'll just read 15 more minutes and then go do some things I need to do"" turns into flipping one more page for two hours until I finish. Because every 15 minutes is 15 minutes deeper into a tunnel that you can't turn around in, you must keep going, walking, then powerwalking, then jogging, then running. Until the end. Phew. What a book!"
1130,Michelle Falco,Loved this book. the narration and characters 
1131,Bex Dawkins,"This was so hard to put down.We follow the story of a girl on a train (no spoilers there...) who, at the same point in her journey every day, peers into the lives of two couples whose houses back onto the train tracks. An innocent enough situation for our protagonist to be in. However, as the story begins to unravel we learn more and more about the girl on the train and the people that she observes and our views continually shift as the plot twists and turns.Paula Hawkins is one of those writers that has great skill in giving the reader just the right amount of breadcrumbs to keep them on the trail, but not enough to see where they're headed. This novel kept surprising me until the end and was a lot darker than I first thought. A great read."
1132,Amanda Torsani,So good! I couldn't stop reading it. 
1133,Sarah Waldron,"Wow what a read. I can't believe that this took me two days to read because I honestly didn't want to put it down at all, but unfortunately the world must carry on regardless of me wanting to stick my head in my book. Such messy characters in this book, all with their own issues and problems but there were moments when I liked each and every one of them even if it was for a very short period in the story. I really empathised with Rachel through the whole book. First being unable to conceive and then your husband shipping you out before shipping a replacement in within days - how does anyone pick themselves up right away and move on from that?! For this reason I never felt negatively towards her, I just felt sorry for her struggle. I didn't manage to connect with Anna very much I found her a little heartless at times but my opinion of her at the twist ending did change. Fab ""whodunnit"" book that kept me intrigued and hanging on right until the very end. I would love to see this on either the big or small screen, I think it would make a brilliant drama or film and translate really well. Well deserved 5*s from me :)"
1134,Brenda Schoolcraft,"A well crafted thriller. I became a cave dweller, and didn't leave the book for much more, than provisions, and self care. It was like being on a runaway train, not knowing where it was going. The twists and turns of the track taking you to another dimension of the story. Loved it! Paula Hawkins have proved herself to be a master story teller. Congratulations."
1135,Bri,"full review at:https://shesreading.wordpress.comHOLY CRAP, THIS WAS SOOO GOOD GUYS.I thought the beginning was a tad bit slow just because not much was happening plotwise. But then I didn't even noticed how much I didn’t want to put this book down until I HAD TO (damn you, work).I was expecting something much different than what the book actually delivered. Every review said it was almost exactly like Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn, which I loved but I didn’t want to read a copycat book, you know?I thought the multiple-person narrative worked excellently for this book. I thought I would get confused, but it easy to notice a difference in the voices. And even if I was confused, having the narrators name at the top of every page in the chapter would’ve helped quite a bit. Also having the dates at the beginning of the chapter helped establish a solid timeline of events – I felt a bit like a detective double checking the time and dates while reading.I did find the main character, Rachel, quite annoying during the majority of the book. She’s an alcoholic and very self-deprecating and every time she would lie about anything, I’d cringe. But then I ended up loving her and her bravery after learning the reason behind her alcoholism during the conclusion of the novel.A few of the other notes I took while reading:“Is Megan framing the therapist?Is it the red-haired guy from the train station?Why is Rachel so stupid? ugh.I bet Tom is Mac.Was Megan cheating on Scott with Tom?”Word of advice- after finishing the novel, go back and reread the first two pages. Amazing context.I highly highly highly recommend this book. This book is definitely going on my favorite books list. I can’t wait to reread this whole book again and catch more stuff that I’ve probably missed. Well, that probably have to wait until much later because there’s other books that are just asking to be read.."
1136,Helena Strickland,"I finished the book in a week and I was like...Should I even say why I gave this book 5 stars??It was one of the best books I have ever read!! It was perfect!!I loved everything!! The story, the 3 different narrators, the mystery, the back and forth, the plot twists, the amazing end... There was nothing that I did not like! I don't think that there is a book that can follow that.It was The best psychological thriller I have ever read!!!Someone who loves thriller books and specially Stephen King's books should definitely read it!"
1137,Breen,"This is a 4.5/5! Very Hitchcock. Fast paced and suspenseful. Loved how the train motif permeated the stylization of the whole book. Would recommend to anyone looking for an easy, interesting, and fast thriller. MY only beef...why the *****SPOLIER******* killer really were the way they were? They were a pathological liar just because? The explanation was rather weak, but it didn't ruin my liking of the book. "
1138,Val,Fabulous thriller. The narration by the alcoholic Rachel is cringe worthy at times - found myself talking (yelling) out loud to her several times. Kept me guessing throughout the book.
1139,Krystle Mitchell,"Girl On The Train is a mindboggling, mysterious twist that hooks you from the beginning. Paula Hawkins is very detailed with her writing which makes the 235-page book kind of slow. However, the story is so intriguing that it doesn't matter how slow it might seem. Hawkins brings to life main character Rachel, who is a divorced alcoholic, by having her try to piece together the many puzzle pieces that unravel throughout the story from her drunken blackouts. The book is also narrated by two other characters who play a huge role in piecing the puzzle to together known as Anna and Megan. I recommend this book to someone who enjoys being captured by small climaxes that lead to one unsuspecting peak, which keeps you guessing until the end. I gave this book 5 stars because as I was reading this book I kept wanting more. I wanted each character to expand their perspectives and get deeper into their feelings, and Hawkins did just that. "
1140,Mari Anne,"Stayed up late two nights in a row because I couldn't put this down. Tight and taut and fraught with intrigue and danger. Best thriller I've read since Gone Girl, this has great movie potential! Don't start it unless you have time to finish it because you won't want to put it down! A sort of modern day retelling of Rear Window with a nasty twist!"
1141,Susan Garden,It was a bit odd at first but quickly became a 'can't put it down' read. Loved it!
1142,Rebecca Cole,"Great readNice book that had me on the edge of my seat near the end. Took awhile to get there, but I was not disappointed."
1143,Bernadette Keeling,"Most people know about this book by now I guess although I have met a few over the last day or so who had not heard of it. It is very successful and I can see why. From the beginning it pulls you in, throwing out questions which you just HAVE to know the answers to. The three viewpoint characters are so well drawn that you forget that they are not real people and, for me, this is where the magic lies. Their world becomes yours. Utterly. There is enough detail of the everyday to make you feel as though you are there with them yet, somehow, not a word is wasted as the pace never lets up. The mystery at the heart of the novel is solvable, but that is part of the charm. You want to solve it, you need to solve it, almost as much as Rachel. And when it is finally unraveled it is satisfying, even if you did guess where it was heading. The delicacy with which the author reveals information and develops character is breathtaking. A great read."
1144,Niki Stacey,"So, so amazing. This book keeps you guessing then totally blind sides you. I don't want to give a word of it away, just read it. "
1145,Ulla Eickhardt,"Wow. Lige en bog for mig. Jeg har læst, at mange synes, bogen ligner Gone Girl (Kvinden, det forsvandt) og The Good Girl (Den perfekte pige). Det er jeg helt enig i. Sprog og stemning minder om hinanden i alle tre bøger, men jeg nød denne bog og The Good Girl mest. Dejligt med en krimi, der er spændende fra først til sidst uden at det er nødvendigt at have et enormt stort, uoverskueligt persongalleri. Det gør ikke denne bog (og de to andre) mindre interessant, at man som læser ikke rigtigt kan finde ud af, hvem man skal tro på, - og at alle personer er meget nuancerede og ikke umiddelbart nemme at forholde sig til. "
1146,Elle,"The first few pages of this book were dark and depressing, but hang in there..... once you get inside the head of Rachel and Megan things finally take off... The main character Rachel is so raw, naïve and vulnerable. She is so different from your typical, life is great, I am beautiful and rich main character. It was refreshing. The ending definitely had the best twists and is what makes the book so great...I could not put it down."
1147,Usha,"Everyone is talking about how this book is like Gone Girl. This is a mystery/thriller/suspense drama and it is about a girl. But that is where the similarity ends. The book is told in three different women's point of view and they are all connected by one man. The main character is Rachel. She is a divorced alcoholic who blacks out whenever she is drunk. Then there is Anna and Megan. Megan goes missing and Rachel feels like she knows what happened to her but can't recall exactly what she witnessed. No one trusts her because she is an alcoholic and she doesn't even trust herself. Very moving and depressing story but it does end on a hopeful note. When I finished reading Gone Girl I thought Nick and Amy deserved each other but at the end of this book I really sympathized with the women, especially Rachel. An excellent read!"
1148,Sara Guernsey,Easily one of the best books I've read this summer!
1149,Beth Chase,"I really liked this book. Interesting plot, kept my interest, was well written, and had just the right amount of twists and turns you want in a thriller."
1150,Rachel Amanda,Great twists and turns!!
1151,Alisha Dorsey,Loved it! Couldn't put it down! 
1152,Brandi Leanne,"I finished this book in under 24 hours, it managed to bring me out of my reading slump and kept me intrigued the entire time. While reading, I kept thinking of ways the book was going to end and what the big twist was but I was wrong the whole time. I was quick to guess what was going to happen in Gone Girl, but with this book I had no idea what was coming. It kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time and I couldn't put it down because I needed to know what was going to happen. So glad I picked this up! "
1153,Lisa Elliott-de la O,"As an avid mystery/thriller reader I suffer from the double edge of being able to figure out what's really going on before the author's unveiling. On one edge is the smug satisfaction of not being fooled. On the other edge is the disappointment of not being fooled long enough to really enjoy the book all the way through. What was interesting here-at least for me-was the fact Hawkins kept me guessing to the very end and it was not because there was some surprise new character at the end, or even a character who has remained on the margins. It left me feeling that I had been walking in the company of a killer for chapters and chapters without giving him/her a second look. Ah-a satisfaction that is so much better than being right!"
1154,Lisa Shawn,"I really enjoyed this book, even though every character is despicable: drunkards, cheaters, abusers, busybodies, murderers, and liars (and some are a combination). I enjoyed it because it was suspenseful and the reader does not figure out who the murder is until the end (or at least this reader did not). The book is a suspense/murder mystery in the same vein as Gone Girl (although not nearly as graphic or gory) and Silent Wife (although not quite as manipulative). The book is told through dueling narratives from the perspectives of the three main female characters; Rachel: a busybody, divorced drunk. She is probably the most pitiful of all the characters. Rachel's alcoholism costs her her job, but she continues to ride the train every day, making up stories about a couple she sees each day. When she observes something suspicious, the police don't consider her a reliable witness. Anna: the mistress, now second wife of Tom. She is completely without a conscious and feels no guilt for how she destroyed Rachel's life and is selfish and self-absorbed. Megan: A bored, self-absorbed housewife who cannot seem to get her act together, so she decides to have affairs to kill time. This move costs her her life. And then there is Tom and Scott: the two husbands of the saga. I listened to the audiobook and enjoyed the various British accents and some of the cultural differences. Overall, a good suspenseful story with very little blood and gore. "
1155,Ana,Really enjoyed this book! Couldn't put it down!Enjoyed it more than Gone Girl which I have seen it compared to. I did guess who done it about half way through but was still gripped by the story. Great read.
1156,Enzo,"Every once in a while there comes a book that changes how you see a category or genre. ""The Girl on the Train"" is one of those. Fast paced and with an ever changing point of view between one of three different narrators. Rachel (the alcoholic ex-wife) who is in the outs and looks at her past life with adoring eyes. Anna (the other woman) who stole Rachel's husband and new mother. Megan (artsy young woman) who is viewed by Rachel from the train as the idyllic wife in her dreams.Rachel who passes her ex house spies on another couples life every time the train passes behind their house. She finds their lives idyllic and romantic. Until one day, something she sees shatters her dream, just to discover something gruesome has taken place. Being an alcoholic, she in not believed by the authorities and so begins her search of her memories in order to solve the mystery. As with most thriller mysteries, we can't tell you much detail without giving up the prize. But once you get started with the novel it is very hard to put down as you are kept guessing through out. The suspense on some parts is really good. You can even hear the ""violin screech"" from Psycho inside your head. Not that the narrators are worthy of trust.Very recommendable. "
1157,Holly Hunt,Loved all the twists in this book! Great crime drama.
1158,Gwen,"The Girl on the Train is at heart a mystery with an unreliable narrator, which can be frustrating (read: manipulative and annoying). What makes this work so well is that we're not actually sure how unreliable she is. We get told she is, and we have reason to believe the other characters, but we're not sure if we should believe them more than we believe her. It's very well done. It's also refreshing to see an everyday woman with everyday problems that aren't being laughed off or undermined by being over-dramatised in a Bridget Jones kind of way. The mystery is really good, too - I'm not surprised to see it's being considered for a film. The book is more thoughtful than you think it will be (ignore comparisons to Hitchcock, which aren't really relevant) and also very exciting - I read a review whose author said the ending was disappointing, and I couldn't see why. I thought this was really good, especially for a first book."
1159,Susan Swiderski,"No need to add my review to the thousands that have come before. Suffice it to say, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It walks the thin line between reality and fantasy, and hovers above the deep dark abyss of alcohol-induced black-outs, where that line is even thinner.A very enthusiastic four and a half stars, rounded up to five."
1160,Kathryn Kitt,Could not put this book down! Gone Girl with a pathetic main character. Hated her but liked her all the same.
1161,Jessica O'connell,Wow. This is a real page turner. I saw someone review it as a faster-paced Gone Girl; I would agree and add that it is less predictable and has much better characters. I literally had trouble putting it down for the last hundred pages or so because I just needed to know how it would end. Great story and very well written.
1162,Kathryn,Could not put it down. This is the first book in a while that I've read cover to cover in a day. Highly recommended!
1163,Jackie Olson,"Holy cow. That was completely unexpected, i loved every minute of it."
1164,Dawn Abron,"4.5This is my one and probably only adult fiction book I'll read this year.So this book was really good.Don't expect too much action because there's none. It's a slow moving story that relies heavily on character development.Hawkins geniusly plays with your mind and not in the obvious ways. (view spoiler)[ I was a quarter of the way into the book until I realized that Rachel was unemployed. Hawkins relied on the assumptions of the human mind that makes us believe that when a person gets on a train in the morning and comes home on the train in the evening, that person is going to work. However, Rachel didn't have a job.  (hide spoiler)]It is a true psychological thriller because as the reader, you go back and forth as to who you think dunnit. I will admit, I did have a guess and I was correct. My guess wasn't just a out of the blue, I was able to come to a conclusion based on the details of the story and I was confirmed based on the details of the story. I love it when an author leaves clues for the reader to figure out who dunnit.Hawkins leaves little crumbs for the reader. Several of the characters had skeletons but they weren't revealed all at once.I have two complaints. One is that women aren't portrayed in a very positive light in this novel. There are four women in the story and none of them were strong women when it came to men, not even Cathy. I know they all have their problems but one of them could have been stronger. This however is not the reason why I didn't give it a 5.The ending was a little anti-climactic. Because 95% of the novel was good, I gave it a 4.5.Overall, I really enjoyed the book. It was exciting and it was written well."
1165,Mandy Skinner,Wow what a great book! I finished in 1 day because I could not put it down. Great book 
1166,Fiona,"""The Girl On The Train"" is one of those books that you will either love or hate. I for one enjoyed it immensely!The Characters were so messed up - all in their own sick way - that I couldn't put the book down. The concept drew me to the book at the very start and the concept was the thing that kept me wanting more (it basically got me hooked and I read the book in a day; I'm not even kidding)Yes, it was a slow start, but once you really got to know the characters and are well invested into the storyline I guarantee that you will want to find out what happens yet. The book itself plays with so many psychological factors and Paula Hawkins really brought across every character with so much detail and ""care"" (with care I mean that although it is a rather short book, the characters are what make the book so great in my eyes; They're the centre of what drew me in. Yes, the storyline is suspenseful and has some great twists that I didn't see coming, but overall the history and personality of each and every person who is introduced to the plot is what makes the book what it is - thrilling and a great fun and non-regrettable read.)I really recommend this book, I read it a few months ago and sometimes still find myself thinking about the book, the characters and the storyline. THAT is what convinced me this book was not good, but a masterpiece. If the author somehow manages to burn this book/storyline/the twists/ THIS GREAT READ into my brain and sub-conscience, she's done something right!"
1167,Henna Bagha,"I have so much to say about this book and I don't even know where to start. Let me first off by saying that anyone who wants to read this book, first read Gone Girl. Read Gone Girl and then read this and then tell me if you can even compare the two because you can't. In so many ways this book was more intense, faster, and creepier than Gone Girl. But in an extremely good way. I personally didn't finish this book in one sitting, but if you wanted to, you could and you probably will if you have an entire afternoon to commit to this book. Actually, even if you don't want to use an entire afternoon, you will. I promise you will. From the beginning to the end, you just have no idea what will happen next. You have no idea which character you can trust and want to believe in. Honestly, you can't trust any of them. They are all corrupted and messed up in their own way and that's the thing that makes you dying to want more. You need more each time you turn the page. This is so engrossing and the minute you think you know what will happen, the complete opposite happens from beginning to end. It will keep you interested throughout. The story takes place with three female characters, and each time their perspective ends, you feel disappointed because you're so engrossed in what their perspective is that you don't care about the next character that comes up. I want to give spoilers but I can't. All I'm going to say is that none of the characters can be trusted and that what happens in the end is the least expected and the entire story leads up to it. I've learned that The Girl on the Train is supposed to be a film, and I already can't wait for it. Granted, novels that turn into movies are usually let-downs but I am looking forward to this. This book has to be one of the best novels of 2015. Hands down. No contest because it is that good. Paula Hawkins cannot stop here with just this one story. "
1168,Louise Wilson,Loved this book. A must read
1169,Darden North,"Paula Hawkins' ""The Girl on the Train"" is a high speed ride in audioEarly reviewers of this novel touted it as the next “Gone Girl."" However, as wonderful as Gillian Flynn's novel is, Paula Hawkins' train overtakes it well before the end of the line. Hawkins' time-stamped structure of the story told in first person by three separate, but deeply entwined female main characters, lets the mystery unravel at just the right speed. The British accents of the three superb female narrators of the audio version of “The Girl on the Train” draw the reader (or listener) into the darkness of the unique tale and its unexpected climax. The voice inflections and diction variations between the jilted Rachel, jealous Anna, and twisted Megan are at times as mesmerizing as the prose. Alcoholic protagonist Rachel's memory lapses and her struggles with the disease are central to the story line and her human frailty is so exposed and explored that no reader could deny her empathy and sympathy.The female narrators do an outstanding job as well with the voices and acting of the roles of the major male characters, Scott and Tom, and with the minor male characters such as the red-handed man. Even if someone has read the print or digital version of ""The Girl on the Train,"" I recommend listening to the audio version, too. After following the narrators' British accents and the colloquialisms, I well understand the fervor shared with millions over the television series ""Downton Abbey."" -----Darden Northwww.dardennorth.com"
1170,Trica Fox,"And another 5 star! That's 2 in a row for me! I listened to this book on Audible. Narration was really good. I couldn't wait to listen.....took the long way home from work......what, you need eggs from the store??? Of course I can go, anything to listen longer :-) Twists and surprises!!! "
1171,Kimberly Sabatini,"Bit of a slow start, especially coming off my last book, but it had me going right up until the end. Liked it better than Gone Girl. "
1172,Marie-pier Comeau,"Amazing!! When you start, you can stop until you get to the bottom of it!"
1173,The Writing Reader,"My Rating: 4.5 stars (out of 5)It’s breaking records on Goodreads. It’s lengthy time on the New York Times bestsellers list has been raising eyebrows. Stephen King praises it. So what’s up with this critically-acclaimed suspense novel?I purchased this book in its second week of success. I walked down hallways holding this book open with my thumb and pinky finger of one hand, eating with the other. At this page-flipping rate, it didn’t take long to reach the end. As a suspense novel, I think that makes it easy to be appreciated by a large audience. Not everyone likes romance. Not everyone like contemporary. Not everyone likes an adventure. But everyone wants to know what happens to the alcoholic girl on the train, whose imagination and ex-husband sit in the small houses not far from a spot where the train stops everyday. Close enough for Rachel, this alcoholic of a protagonist to see through the windows. And she’s the only one looking when something shocking begins the suspenseful, thrilling, tense and page-flipping mystery in this book. Rachel is a character that anyone would be frustrated with in-person. But that makes her character just a little more intriguing as you get to know her character: why she rides the train to an imaginary job every day and why she drinks herself to sleep every night. It’s impossible to totally predict the ending of this book. Readers may suspect, but every chapter, every surprise, is another reason to doubt your guesses about who is responsible for the chaos in the small houses by the railroad tracks. The third person makes the plot even more suspenseful in that unique way only the third person can switch quickly from scene to scene, featuring different characters. Paula Hawkins is a talented writer. (How else would she make it to the top of the New York Times bestsellers list? It’s part of the requirements.) I would say that the one thing that could create negative opinions about this book is that Paula Hawkin’s writing is one of those styles that just appeals to some people, and not as much to others. Even if the negative reviews say it was the plot, I truly believe it just wasn’t their writing type. Everyone has a writing type. It explains why so many people (asides from the sex-readers) like Fifty Shades of Grey. It’s probably why I liked Anna and The French Kiss so much. I recommend this book to any one who wants a good escape of a book. A book that’ll have them on the edge of their seats. It’s suspense. It stands at the top of the thriller genre.

1174,Niloofar,"This was a very fast read for me (two days) and I enjoyed every minute of it. It has love, betrayal, mystery, murder and more. Rachel the ""girl on the train"" is a pretty complex character in that she is so self destructive with no confidence at all, but underneath all the layers you see the good in her and you find yourself rooting for her. All the male characters in this book were about as unlikable and intolerable as you can get. This book was compared to Gone Girl, which I have to agree with, which I happen to like a lot. Get it. Read it. Once you start, you will not be able to put it down."
1175,Gosia,"Oh dear, that was hell of a book. Gave me an anxiety, because in the certain moment I know something was going to happen, but it was a great read.Characters which you hate, they are that well-written. But in one moment they are get the likeable values, so..Story is keeping you fascinated. You just want to read, you know on each page there will be new discovery, and almost on every ending of the chapter there is a plot twist.What an awesome read it was. I envy all of you who still will read it for the first time."
1176,Diana Maynard,"The book was first class. However, the narrators were awful. Their attempts to pretend to be a man were like a terrible parody, and were desperately inconsistent. And the whole reading was over-dramatic. Don't get the audiobook, but do read it in print."
1177,Dina Bensreti,Best book I've read in over a decade. Read it before the film comes out.
1178,Rachel Sprague,"This was so good and twisted, and towards the end I had to go back and reread bits from the beginning because they turned out to not be about what I had originally thought. Full of so many unreliable narrators, and no one is always telling the full truth. I had a hard time putting this down."
1179,Ashley Cabana,"I'm glad I finished this book. Kind of boring at first. There is not a character you'll like. All of them have real bad qualities. But I found when I wasn't reading this book, I was thinking about it. You'll most likely be able to guess who the killer is. "
1180,Sarah Buttigieg hoppen,Fab fast-paced book!
1181,Rusty," Terrific thriller! I had read no reviews of this one before I opened it to read and I didn't realize that it was a thriller. However, I found the key character, Rachel, a quite ordinary individual who has reached a dismal place in her life. Divorced, she turns to alcohol and loses her job because of her drinking. In short, she is an alcoholic. To avoid her flatmate's discovery of the jobless state, Rachel takes the train every day into London as if she were going to work. She sits in a window seat and becomes fascinated by a couple she sees on their patio so often she feels she begins to know them and gives them names. One day she sees a strange man embracing the woman. When the woman disappears without a trace Rachel wonders what could have happened and becomes involved in the search for her. However, no matter what she finds who would believe an alcoholic who has blackouts. There is a twist to this story. Yes, I did determine what happened to the missing woman, and, in turn, why and who was involved. It's exciting and keeps the reader turning page after page. Rarely do I give a mystery/thriller five stars but since I couldn't put this one down I chose to do so. See if you like it as much as I did. "
1182,Juhina,"Want a thriller read done right? pick up The Girl on the Train. There, that is my review in one short sentence convincing you to pick it up. The Girl on the Train was a gritty, sometimes even uncomfortable like read. Rachel, the main protagonist, is so unlikable.. actually, every single main character in this book is hateful. More than once I was disgusted by Rachel and I feel that is what made the book such a different experience for me. There is no clear indication on who you should be rooting for or who you can side with or who the hell to trust and confide in. *shivers* this book really gave me the creeps, and I loved every single page of it! Granted, the beginning was slow, it took me a day or two to get to page 70 but right after we are finally up to what the synopsis reveals, you are officially locked in this game of lying, deceit, despicable characters, and suspicion. Told from an almost dual POV of Rachel and someone else, as well as their two differing timelines that will ultimately diverge, you can't help but run a 100 theories through your head trying to figure out where Paula Hawkins will take the plot. The pacing of the book and how only fragments of the real story and happenings and memories get thrown at us is what makes it such an addicting read. Rachel is a drunk. Like a complete and utter drunk. Everyday she wakes up saying she'll quit then drinks as much as humanly possible.. whether it be morning, in the train, or even as soon as she wakes up in bed. As a result of that, Rachel has had her fair share of blackouts and lost memories.. some very important memories that could solve the whole damn mystery. Rachel is not supposed to be a likable character. She frustrated and disgusted (3rd time already?) me to no end. All I wanted to do was shake her and tell her to GET A GRIP and to hell with her cheating ex-husband and to just, for God's sake, MOVE ON. Of course Rachel's demons aren't that easily fought.. and so we trudge along, unwillingly may I add, through Rachel's worthless days.. but that added to the gritty and chilling feeling of the whole novel. I don't think I've read an adult mystery thriller as good as The Girl on the Train.. I know it has been labeled as the next ""Gone Girl"" which I've read, but I truly believe this amped up the suspense and thrill while keeping me engaged throughout the whole novel. While I was able to guess correctly on one point, the motive, and the execution of the crime as well as all the other memory holes are what kept me going. This is a brilliant thriller and I can't recommend it enough. I am interested to see what Paula Hawkins' next book will be and if it's another thriller that will leave me, days later, still thinking and obsessing about the characters and events that took place within the book's pages. "
1183,The Diary of Book Enthusiasts,"The Girl On The Train has garnered a lot of attention from readers last year and I must say as a connoisseur of psychological thrillers it deserves all the hype. The author took an everyday thing we do (riding a train) threw in a person desperate for a release in her current reality so not unlike us everyday humans, and threw in a heinous crime that will curl around your head and live there. The complexity of the characters, how they were interwoven in the story gives it life. Take Rachel, the alcoholic who has an obsession for her ex-husband who married the woman he cheated her with. Anna, who just wants to have the normalcy of a family, forever afraid of the shadow of her husband's ex-wife who is showing signs of getting tired of the shit Rachel is pulling and getting angrier and angrier about it. Tom, the husband in question, trying to be the peace maker but standing firm that he has moved on and Rachel should too. Then there's Rachel's ""Jess and Jason"" as she calls them. The couple who lives near her old house and now where her ex-husband lives with his family. She see's them be a couple and she makes it up in her head how perfect they are, how so alike they were when she and Tom were married. But in reality they have there own problems.The story made me see that sometimes what under the surface is a much darker place. Sometimes what we see as happy is just one side of the story, that there could be an ugly side in an otherwise perfect life. How truth can be twisted by words, especially if it is from someone you trust. How not seeing past the exterior can be deadly.This is a heart-pounding and mind fucking book that will in all sense satisfy every thrill craving you have.I recommend reading this book while on a train to somewhere not for any special reason but because you will feel a little bit closer to what Rachel experience. Look out the window, see the cars, houses and people passing by and try to imagine, make up the story. It feels really satisfying that way.~ Djan"
1184,A.J. Waines,"I’d been meaning to read The Girl on the Train for a while – daunted by the fact that it had a similar title to one of my thrillers (Girl on a Train) – which came out the year before, by the way - for those who have asked!). I was also aware that the two books were getting mixed up by readers, as you might imagine.Well – I finally got around to finding out what all the fuss was about – and Paula Hawkins’ book is indeed a stonking good read! In fact, it is an excellent example of a psychological thriller with unreliable and damaged narrators and everyone in the book covering things up, telling lies, pretending, making assumptions and being unable to trust anyone – not even the police officers provide an oasis of safety. When I consider the actual storyline, it’s relatively straight forward – based around a single crime, but it’s the execution that is key. Paula uses every device known to authors in order to create a book that moves forward faster than the Eurostar and is extremely hard to put down. There are short alternating chapters with drama or conflict of some kind on almost every page. Every scene has something within it that, according to whichever of the three narrators is centre-stage, is unexplained, or confusing or ‘not quite right’, which leaves the reader with a perpetual sense of ‘what’s going on?’ Have you ever used a ‘fitball’ or wobble board at the gym? This book is like being on one of those – you don’t know which way you’re going to be tipped at any moment. There is a relentless tug around who the bad guy is – when all of the characters (apart from Rachel’s flatmate), seem to be plotting, hiding something, sneaking around or behaving shamefully in some way.Don’t expect a smooth ride to the next stop – there's not a lot of time to admire the view. Not the kind of writing I would always want from a book - but I loved it!"
1185,Susan,"A woman who blacks out when she drinks too much watches people's lives from the train to and from her residence to London. Some people she sees so often she makes up names and lives for them. Other people she knows from her past and wants to alter their lives. When one of the people whose life she watches goes missing on a day she sees something from the train and on the night when she is in the area, the questions become how is she involved, does she know the person who may have done something, will anyone believe her, and can she save herself? We learn early on that she is an unreliable narrator and we can't believe what she tells us or what she thinks she knows. She lies to herself as well as to the other characters and to us. "
1186,Karen Mossman,"What a brilliant book! It was one of those that grabs you slowly reel you in, bit by bit. When it does, wow, you can't putt down.The main character, Rachel, is not the traditional heroine, she's not particularly likeable - at first. We start reading her thoughts, her point of view, as she looks down on a row of houses from the train as she passes to and from work.It turns out that it isn't just a row of houses as the story unfolds. The author leaves lots of clues, which you don't pick up upon until later - I like that, it's clever writing. Things gradually start to make sense as we read on and it changes to a total of three different points of view. This gives us different perspectives on the story.It's very clever and as just as I worked out what was going on, there is a twist and a twist and probably another one, too. I lost count.Certainly my best read off the year. Hats off to Paula Hawkins!"
1187,Aiesha,"EXCELLENT book!! I just could not get enough of this story. It was very well written, a little on the repetitive side, but at the same time, given the nature of the main character and what she was dealing with, it was fitting! I was just blown away... I've never heard of this author. I believe she is new but if all her upcoming books suck you in as this one does, I'm sold!! Loved it!!"
1188,Patti,"Great!Hard to follow at first. But loved it after that. If you loved Gone Girl, you'll love this book for sure."
1189,Victoria VanTiem,"I devoured this book. In fact, I woke up at 3am second guessing my early theory and had to keep reading out of curiosity. Rachel, the main character, reminded me of Sasha from The Hypnotist Love Story by Liane Moriaty because both have similar profiles. However, the way this novel unravels is completely all its own. I loved the structure. We witness the story through several key characters’ perspectives at different time points and not until nearly the end do we see it all come together. The characters are unapologetically and seriously flawed and yet they are everyday people--our spouses and neighbors--and that alone disturbs. Absolute stellar debut. Although I’ll need to follow with a much lighter book. Something that shows the sunnier side of humanity."
1190,Patty,"No book will actually be ""the next Gone Girl"", that's not a fair assessment. That said...This was a great book with unpleasant characters and kept me reading through the night. "
1191,Nina,"This book was described as ""a gripping and enthralling psychological thriller"". It lives up to the description. It was a page turner and an suspenseful mystery. It was much better than Gone Girl which I personally did not like. I read it almost right through and am missing it. Excellent novel by a new author."
1192,Calyan,I understand why some people said they didn't like this book. I will say that the characters reminded me of some of Gillian Flynns characters (very unlikeable) but that's where the similarity stopped. I listened to this book on audio and read it using Amazons narration thingy. That's a big reason why the book immediately held my interest otherwise it probably would have taken me longer to finish. I won't give you a synopsis because plenty of other people have already done that. But....this book isn't for everyone. Some will love it while others hate it. It really is terribly depressing and there is no happy ending. Just reality 
1193,Jalawa,"Wow! This was an exceptional read. I felt every emotion, dependency, pain...I felt everything. Hawkins, allowed the reader to espy the painful consequences of giving in to our weaknesses. The book was intense, and I not once wanted to put it down until I arrived at the last page of her book, The Girl On The Train (and when my vision became blurred and eyes crossed).I loved how she developed Rachel's imagination. In a way, the train daydreams reminded me of myself. I totally, anticipate reading more work from her. It's so much easier looking at someone and writing their life verses actual getting to know them. This is definitely, a bit more than a 5 star GoodRead in my opinion. "
1194,Nicole Sampson,Definitely a page turner with twists and turns! Gone girl-ish for sure. 
1195,Naim Hammadi,"When I saw this book in the first position of the USA Today Best seller books list and all the negative reviews about it in goodreads.com or any other website and how people are comparing it to Gone Girl and listing all the similarities of the 2 books, I almost change my mind about reading it but I told myself I'll give it a shot and review it myself and believe me I did not and I'm not regretting having read it.All of the negative reviews didn't stop me of reading this book and actually it shouldn't stop anyone too.Go ahead guys and read it and forget all about some some negative reviews because it's a really really good book and believe me you'll have fun reading it."
1196,Justine,"I enjoyed this book. Easy to read, fast paced enough to keep me turning pages and not skim parts (which I tend to do if bored), and interesting story. I liked the flawed main character (well maybe not liked but understood her perhaps). I would definitely read more from this author. I don't know why it is so often compared to Gone Girl though (which I also enjoyed)."
1197,Tracey Walsh,"I can't say this book was unputdownable - at times I had to put it down so I could catch my breath and get my head around what was happening.""Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning. Every day she rattles down the track, flashes past a stretch of cozy suburban homes, and stops at the signal that allows her to daily watch the same couple breakfasting on their deck...Their life—as she sees it—is perfect. Not unlike the life she recently lost.And then she sees something shocking. It’s only a minute until the train moves on, but it’s enough. Now everything’s changed.""It's hard to review this book without risking spoilers so I'll keep it brief.The author's writing style is perfect for this kind of fast-paced thriller. The first person narrative alternating between the main female characters made me feel like a mutual friend of each woman. Sure that they had my sympathy they were confiding in me, not realising that with a turn of the page I'd switch allegiance.For the first time in a while I found myself suspicious of almost every character involved in the main plot, so I can hardly take credit for guessing the 'big reveal'. I'd recommend The Girl on the Train to lovers of psychological thrillers that don't pull any punches.Thank you to the publisher for the advance reading copy."
1198,Idania M,"If you like reading a mystery?triller this book is for you, the story will have you sitting on the edge of your seat. this story has three main characters.Rachel Watson is the main character an alcoholic, jobless woman who is struggling to get her life back in order.Megan Hipwell is also jobless, who lives in a house facing the train track.Rachel train stops there everyday. she is married.Anna Watson Rachel""s ex husband second wife who live a few doors from Megan.

At first i was quite confused, i was reading and familiarizing myself with one character, but then i found myself reading about two other people. I really enjoy reading this book i couldn't put it down because i wanted to know more."
1199,Neill Smith,"During the summer of 2013 Rachel rides the train into London everyday pretending to go to the job from which she had been fired and trying to hide her alcoholism from her landlady. She passes houses she recognizes, two in particular, and adopts fantasies about the lives of the people there. Melanie and Scott live in one of the house - Melanie has a failed art gallery in her past and dreams of attending a fabrics course nearby. Anna and Tom live in the other house and they have a Evie. As Rachel's life unfolds we learn more about her past and her involvement with the people she observes from the train and her struggle to sort out the meanings of the events that led to her present life."
1200,Colleen,"Fantastic! Read it in a day, will think about it for many days. No spoilers here, but, kept me guessing the whole time. "
1201,Joan,"This book reminded me of Gone Girl, not only for the great mystery, but also for the unlikeable characters. Rachel is divorced from her husband. She wanted to have a child, but in vitro did not work for them and slowly she became an alcoholic. Tom, a manipulator, husband tells her all the terrible things she does when drunk. He leaves. Rachel moves in with a friend. She doesn't want the friend to know she has been fired because she was drunk, so she leaves for the train every morning. Tom has married and has a daughter, Evie. Rachel continues to call and drive Tom and his wife crazy. On the train Rachel sees a couple in the house near where she used to live. She makes up stories about them and their happiness. Until one day, she sees the woman, Meg kissing another man. Meg disappears and her husband is accused of the murder. Rachel is sure he couldn't have done it. In between drinking, she tries to help him. I enjoyed this mystery and didn't figure it out until near the end. One thing I didn't agree with was Rachel's fear at the end of the book."
1202,Dotty,Wow! This was excellent - read it slowly so you don't miss anything!
1203,Dannii Elle,I finished this book a week ago and I am still speechless. I was hooked and mystified and rattled and intrigued and perplexed and everything a good mystery book should make you feel...and that was only after chapter one!
1204,Lucky,"Sometimes, I tend to finish reading a book in less than a day. But, by the time I get to the end I skip couple of lines and get the gist of the paragraph or a page and skip a lot of narration. So, this time I decided to take my all time I need to read each and every line in the book. Coming to book now, I loved it. This is one of best thrillers I read till this day. I loved every single bit of the book. Though there was a small part where I didn’t really enjoy the read, it was very negligible. I just cannon explain how enticing the book was. It was really hard for me to put the book down. It was worth every single minute of my time. I had quite fun reading it. I cannot praise it enough. I immensely admire Paula Hawkins for such an interesting and gripping read. Rachel was a typical weak girl you could find next door. The way she was entangled into the story seems so real. It was very believable. There was a point where, I was so irritated with her addiction. If she were my friend I would have shown her some tough love for sure. Megan was a little like Amy, from gone girl. I loved the way her character was built. She was that perfect little girl, every one would want to be but once they see into her life, it was everything they would hate to have. For me, she seemed very delusional. She also seemed very shattered, weak and strong at the same time. Anna. What can I tell about her? Do I love her? NO. Do I hate her? Maybe a little. Do I wish she didn’t exist? NO. She was someone I would hate to see in real life. But in this story she was right where she should be and just how we would want her to be. Scott is a good guy, if you ask me. Having couple of weaknesses made his character feel very real. I would have loved to hear a tiny bit of story from Scott’s point of view too. But, he was just the right person to exist as Megan’s husband.Tom… what can I speak about him? He was just perfect. Though I hated few facts about him I loved this character for following his heart. The ending would have been amazing, if there weren’t so much drag. But I am happy with whatever was put together. I found every single missing detail answered and logical enough to fit in. All together, one if the best books I read in the recent past. "
1205,Jolene,Holy crap! Hit the halfway mark and could not put it down! The comparisons to Gone Girl are not fair. I hated Gone Girl!
1206,Gisela,What a great ride!
1207,Nancy Taylor,I could not put it down! Creepy!
1208,Mimi Fintel,"Rachel rides the commuter train to work each day and looks out at the homes as she rides along. Once upon a time, one of the homes was hers until her husband had an affair and left her. Now he and his new wife and baby daughter live there. One day Rachel sees something from the train window. Because Rachel is lonely, broke, and jealous of her ex husband's new life she ends up getting embroiled in a murder mystery connected with what she witnessed from the train window which is only several houses down to her former home. Be ready to want to read ""just one more chapter"" if you pick up this book!"
1209,Adrienne A Nihiser,"Great suspense novelI enjoyed it from beginning to end. Suspenseful from the beginning, no need to wait until the middle of the book!"
1210,Airaology,"Rachel drinks because it lets her slide, warm and loose, into oblivion. I don't blame her.Along the way, we find out just why she'd rather choose oblivion than real life. Rachel is realistic - unreliable, fucked up, weak. She's just a girl on the train, until one day she's no longer just a girl on the train, going back and forth without point or purpose.This book is intense, different and I loved every moment of it. The writing style is different but not that hard to follow (pay attention to the dates given). It's fast paced <3 so there no boring lulls. Each word in each line has a reason. For example, Rachel compares herself with Sylvia Plath and Assia. I want to ring Anna up and remind her that Assia ended up with her head in the oven, just like Sylvia did. I MEAN LIKE, IS THIS FORESHADOWING OR SOMETHING??The description of an alcohol is as well as the gas lighting felt so real to the point where it annoyed meI totally get the hype and am looking forward for more from the author."
1211,Joe Zelenke,Great read for a 1st timer! Looking forward to more...
1212,Roberta Perez,"Excelente. Uma trama complexa, personagens com características peculiares e a presença do trem suburbano. Narrativa atemporal e por 3 diferentes personagens. É preciso estar atento a cronologia de cada uma delas é quem sabe ao terminar, reler os primeiros capítulos. Fazia tempo que não lia um bom suspense. Ele termina mas a história fica com você. O mais gostoso foi terminar este livro dentro de um trem!Recomendado!!!"
1213,Harry Wingfield,"A great thriller. I didn't want to put it down. A friend described it as ""reading popcorn."" I like that - not a whole lot of substance, but once you start you can't stop. And who doesn't love popcorn? The plot combines elements of Rear Window, Vertigo, Gaslight and Psycho. It's a shame Hitchcock isn't still around to direct the movie. But I hear a really good team is being assembled to make the movie, so I have high hopes. "
1214,Kayla ,This was my first audio book and such a good choice!! This story kept me hooked and wanting to listen to more!!
1215,beatriz,"OMG! the last 100 pages of this book were so intense, I couldn't stop reading, I just had to finish this today. IT WAS AMAZING. So intense, so unpredictable, the writing was amazing and the characters were complex and messed up but that is what made me love them more!!! And I was not expecting that character to be the killer AT ALL!! Loved it loved it loved it!!! "
1216,Staczy,Intense and very well done.
1217,Reymigius,"Once I read Psychological Thriller Novel and it was awesome. Dari paragraf awal sampai akhir, novel ini menjanjikan perjalanan yang tak membosankan. Melaju dengan alur yang sempurna –tidak begitu lambat akan tetapi tidak terlalu cepat, penulis dengan lihai mengungkap setiap fakta dengan begitu mencekam.Saya juga sangat menyukai tiga sudut pandang dalam novel ini –Rachel, Megan, dan Anna. Ketiganya begitu realistis, dan alasan dibalik setiap perbuatan mereka bertiga sangat rasional. Saya terutama suka bagaimana masa lalu ketiga tokoh tersebut tidak hanya diceritakan sebagai filler akan tetapi sebagai fondasi yang sangat kokoh bagi kelangsungan cerita.The movie adaptation of this novel starring Emily Blunt and Jared Leto will hit the cinemas on October 2017. Can't wait!"
1218,Kristi Sanders,"Wow! What a story! Dark, suspenseful, and thrilling... When reading late at night, I actually felt frightened at times. It was a great book, and I'm looking forward to the movie version. I can only hope that it is as good as the book. There is so much going on in this story and trying to keep the info straight between each of the female characters perspectives was challenging at times. I think that if I would have had the time to read it in one sitting, it would have been easier to comprehend all of the events taking place. Although it was difficult to put down, I read this over the course of a few days. I had to re-read parts to make sure that I knew where I left off with a particular character's narration (Rachel, Megan, and Anne) so that I could have a better understanding of the story and to eliminate any confusion. That's not a negative...just a warning...be prepared that this book is full of lots of descriptive details given by the three narrators. I enjoyed reading each females' perspective and found this to be a very creative story. I look forward to reading more books by Paula Hawkins! Amazing author!"
1219,Erica,"I'm one of the slowest readers on the planet and the fact that I read this book in 24 hours speaks volumes... at least for me, anyway. I just couldn't put it down. It's that good. Yeah, it's dark and I didn't much care for the characters, however I grew to adore Rachel.... it was still damn good. What an awesome, suspenseful plot... great twists! I really didn't see it coming until right before it all came crashing in. It was an edge of your seat read.... I just wished I could have savored it a little longer. Highly recommend this book!!"
1220,Kelly Hobgood,Loved it! Great thriller!
1221,Angharad,"Had me guessing until the end!! Full of surprises, love the writing style; a great book to start the year with :)"
1222,Naomi Brown,Such a great book to read. I sympathize with the heroine struggling to get people to listen to her when they know she's crazy. Great twists and turns in the plot.
1223,Kathryn Knight,"This book really kept me turning the pages, and that's what I ask for when reading for pleasure. There were some parts that were a bit difficult to believe, but that's true in most fictional stories. A fun and exciting read, with suspense akin to Gone Girl."
1224,Sg,"a great read! fast paced, a real page turner."
1225,Darian,"This book was like a drug. I couldn't put it down. It was addicting, suspenseful and just down right clever. I feel like lots of people also compare this to ""Gone Girl"" but there also two very different books and Girl on the Train has its own kind in suspense and thrill. I loved how Jenkins perfected the perspective of all 3 characters it just really tied the bow for me. The thing is everyone is a really horrible person in this book, they all do something scandalous or commit some kind of negative act which is very intelligently composed. On top of that its just down right twisted and this factor just creatives such a damn cool perspective. This has been one of the best reads I've had in a while, and I would recommend it to anyone no matter what your preference in genres is cause it has a bit of everything. "
1226,MaryannC.Book Fiend,"WOW!! This was riveting, I almost felt like a voyeur at times. Totally mesmerizing, engrossing, you name it. Recommended."
1227,Bebe (Sarah) Brechner,"Powerful, compelling, psychological thriller along the lines of Gone Girl. Word of warning - you will not want to put this one down, so block out a day or so to devour it. Yes, it's just that kind of book. Yes, it is worthy of the hype. I'm expecting a film out of this one, too. Highly recommended."
1228,Reesa Graham,"I read this whole book in two days, ironically, on a train. This book grabs you and doesn't let go. It's a lovely little ride of twists and turns. "
1229,Betsy Hetzel," We know from page 1 that a female has been killed; we don't find out who it is until about 50% through the book and don't have a clue who did it until ~ 80% completed. What a keep-you-guessing, edge-of-your-seat story ! We have three narrators:RACHEL, the main narrator, divorced, unemployed, alcoholic, whose excessive drinking causes her to have blackouts , and she has no memories of these black periods. She has totally lost control of her life and is miserable, and is still in love with her ex-husband. But every day, she ""pretends"" to go to work in London, taking the train, and as the train passes this one house, she sees this couple whom she imagines to be the ""perfect"" couple, Megan and Scott. However, she later sees Megan in the garden kissing another man, not so perfect after all. Rachel needs to be somebody, needs to feel worthwhile but does so in such inappropriate, damaging ways. She is trying hard to redeem herself.MEGAN, the beautiful wife of the perfect couple who has a checkered past and many dark secrets hidden even from her husband Scott. Megan needs to have sexual control over men; with her, it's a game , and she doesn't like to lose. Unfortunately, her past comes back to haunt her in an unexpected way.ANNA, Rachel's ex husband Tom's new wife, w/ whom he had an affair while married to Rachel, later married Anna, and they have a child. Anna needs Rachel, whom she sees as dangerous, unstable, and frightening, to leave her, her husband and their daughter alone. But, maybe all is not as it seems in her household. Finally at ~80% of the book, the killer is discovered for what he REALLY is, by Rachel, and.... I did NOT have a clue. A MUST read, for sure !! "
1230,Priyanka Atmadja,"""One for sorrow, two for joy, three for a girl... Three for a girl. I'm stuck on three, I just can't get any further. My head is thick with sounds, my mouth thick with blood. Three for a girl. I can hear the magpies, they are laughing, mocking me, a raucous cackling. A tiding. Bad tidings. I can see them now, black against the sun. Not the birds, something else. Someone's coming. Someone is speaking to me. Now look. Now look what what you made me do.""Oke jadi itu kutipan pertama dari novel ini, I got so confused because I was actually understood it. Tapi entahlah ini jadi my favorite quote on this book. So strange but has a deep meaning, ternyata this is all about Megan. She died with her baby, her body discovered with a broken bone. Sad. Pelakunya orang terdekat dari tokoh utama ini, sungguh gak dipercaya. Awalnya I thought the murdered were Kamal or Scott, tapi no, ah sial bener-bener dipermainkan istingku disini, haha. I really love this book, ini pertama kalinya aku baca buku Thriller, this book blowing my mind banget dan this book has changed my perception about life. Really can't wait for the movie! "
1231,Noura,I loved loved loved it .. It gave me the thrill of Gone Girl maybe more amazing book great plot i was on the edge of my seat the whole time .. Unexpected events i just love it !!
1232,G. Lawrence,"I really enjoyed this book; it has a slow, meandering way of folding you into a story which seems so innocent and light to start with but gradually descends into complex darkness. The characters are wonderfully crafted, and all of them are not what they appear to be. Loved the first person narrative and the way it switches perspective. I like that I cant say a lot on the plot lest some of the best bits be given away... But if you enjoy a thrill, a mystery or several scares, wrapped up with what I felt was a true understanding of the fragility of people and the nature of abuse, in many forms you'll enjoy this. Its a complex, intelligent thriller where no character is left as a 2D image, but all are given a life, soul, and a brokenness I found realistic, rich and compelling."
1233,Kate Whitman,"Best thriller I have read since Night Film. I had my suspicions about who the killer was early on but it did not diminish my enjoyment or slow my pace. I wanted to spend every spare minute of the past three days with this book. Certainly not an uplifting book but the ending does not make you angry the way Gone Girl does. I really want this to be a movie, such a great vehicle for three actresses."
1234,Erin A.,"Really great book! Similar style to ""Gone Girl"", the book is told from the vantage point of the 3 women protagonists. The last 20% of the book is highly suspenseful, and I look forward to the movie version. "
1235,Karen Lester,"If you liked Gone Girl, you will love this book. I Couldn't put it down, which for me hasn't happened in a long time!! Kept me at the edge of my seat until the end. Highly recommend. "
1236,Sanjeeta Bains,"Amazing. The best book I've read in a long time. Maybe even better than Gone Girl. I love that there are three strong female characters in this book and so Hollywood has no choice but to embrace that in their upcoming film version. The film version star Emily Blunt as Rachel and is set in New York. I can really see Emily in the role and look forward to her depicting Rachel's alcoholism and how a couple of strangers ultimately save her from descending into total oblivion. I'm very, very excited to find out who will pay the rest of the cast. "
1237,Book'd,"Beware before ride this train !!A power packed suspense thriller, you cannot get down once you board this train.Amazing story line & gripping narration will not allow you to put down this book once you start off.A must read for every fiction lover."
1238,Kelly Parker,"I figured out the ending about 3/4 of the way through, which maybe is later than most people would, I'm not sure. But I found this book endlessly fascinating. Three fairly unreliable narrators, all women, all very different. I didn't particularly LIKE any of them, but I still enjoyed reading things from their perspective. Definitely check this out! (Also, the comparisons to Gone Girl are pretty ridiculous. It's really nothing like Gone Girl.)"
1239,Γιώργος Λιαδής,"Στην αρχή μοιάζει με γυναικουλίστικο μυθιστόρημα (υποθέτω). Αυτή που δεν έκανε παιδιά και αυτός που την παράτησε για μια άλλη και έμεινε στο σπίτι που έμεναν παλιά και έκανε παιδί με την άλλη και η αυτή περνάει με το τρένο και τον αγαπάει ακόμα και... Αααααααα! Το πρώτο 1/4 είναι φριχτό! Τα υπόλοιπα 3/4 τα κατάπια (από το σημείο της εξαφάνισης μιας τύπισσας και λίγο αργότερα). Μου κράτησε το ενδιαφέρον μέχρι το τέλος. Του βάζω 5 αστεράκια γιατί δεν μπορώ να βάλω 4,5 και τα 4 είναι για τα βιβλία που δεν μετάνιωσα που διάβασα. Αυτό είναι κάτι παραπάνω, κάτι που θα θυμάμαι σε λίγο καιρό. "
1240,Martin Smrz,"Oh yeah. This book had me grabbed, I could not stop reading it till the end. It is well set up, there are not that many characters and actually each of them has been in my mind the one who did it at certain time in the book. Any one could have done it :-). Of course the main character with its alcoholism was not always likeable, but the author had to blur the story somehow and seems like she described the alcoholic very well.Highly recommended suspense page turner."
1241,Brianna Diosteanu,"My friends and I chose this book for our book club. It was fantastic! I read the book in a day; I couldn't put it down! Just when I thought I had the entire story figured out, something else happened that completely changed my mind. My heart was racing as I read each chapter. Thoroughly enjoyed every page"
1242,Joanne Cerutti,This book was disturbing yet I couldn't put it down. lots of flawed characters with many twists and turns. A bit unbelievable but glad I read it since it has been on the best seller list for so long. I think it would make a great movie.
1243,Viena,"Was the first book I listened to on audio tape. Thought the plot was great, good pacing, nice twist. I would read it again!"
1244,Diana Mtz Trejo,"La chica del tren es una novela de intriga y misterio que se ha convertido en un Best seller mundial, y de la que se han vendido cinco millones de ejemplares en seis meses, permaneciendo 20 semanas en la lista de los libros más vendidos del New York Times, considerándola así la novela para adultos más rápidamente vendida en la historia. Ganadora a mejor libro de misterio en el 2015 en GoodReads y en múltiples publicaciones. La adaptación cinematográfica esta programada para otoño de este año, en la cual los protagonistas serán Emily Blunt y Luke Evans. tenía muchas ganas de leer un buen libro, y ahora comprendo por qué esta historia tuvo tanto revuelo... Es simplemente insólita para mí, normalmente este no es mi genero más sin embargo me mantuvo cautivada desde un inicio. Rachel toma el tren todas las mañanas y desde el puede ver hacia unas casas q están cerca de las vías, la #23 su antigua casa y la #15 la de Jess y Jason, una pareja q le recuerda a diario lo q ella ya no tiene. Sumida en un profunda depresión a causa de su divorcio, Rachel abusa del alcohol al grado de olvidar lo q hizo la noche anterior, pero cuando recuperar su memoria puede resultar ser de vida o muerte, ella no parará hasta lograrlo. Hay veces que me caen tan mal los personajes, Rachel me cayo muy mal a veces, otras me dio lástima, otras estuve completamente de su lado y sentí su rabia, y otras simplemente no la entendía, y es que este un personaje tan complejo, y no me refiero a complicado, sino a lo elaborado q está, podría haber estado narrando la escritora algo q a ella le pasó ya q describe el alcoholismo de Rachel como si fuera algo propio, es de verdad impresionante. Un thriller q te mantendrá con el libro pegado a las manos, tentada a adelantarte unas páginas por q no tienes ni idea del posible final. Se ganó cada estrella. "
1245,J U L ♡,4.5 stars because the end was a bit disappointing
1246,Alison Brinkworth,"I couldn't put this book down. It grabbed my attention from the start and is the most refreshing crime novel I've read in a while, especially in terms of the main character. Really clever idea with the train and Rachel's flaws. Enjoyed it thoroughly and highly recommend it."
1247,Fatma  Elasouad,"The only reason I read this book was because I had a free point from audible. So I 'purchased' The audiobook. Are usually listen to this book on my way to work and on my way home and I have been loving it. Following the different dates was a little tricky at first but I began to get a hang of the different timelines between the narrators.I love how dark and mysterious this book was mainly follow Rachel's point of view but we also hear from Anna and Megan. What I loved about this book was how I had no idea how it was going to end, and who was the killer. It was dark, disturbing and very thrilling to read which was surprising because I had read many mixed reviews about this book mainly good but some bad. I would definitely recommend this book to people who like dark novels. "
1248,Stacy,I loved this book!!!! 
1249,Jack Patterson,"Paula Hawkins' storytelling here is fantastic and I enjoyed every second of this book. If you like unreliable narrators with a penchant for lying to you (the reader), then you'll love this adventure that has a satisfying ending. HIGHLY recommended!"
1250,Ventsislav Kostadinov,"Смразяващо оригинален трилър. Авторката изключително фино е нарисувала тези мрачни отрязъци, разгледани обстойно през погледа на три гледни точки, за да разнищи мощно изключително мрачната и грозна история на едно съвсем непредумишлено убийство. Чрез своя минималисичен подход Паула Хоукинс успешно е изградила много силни психологически образи - особено на убиеца-измамник. Много критика изчетох относно този роман - в по-голямата си част напълно необоснована при това, но мога да кажа, че определено притежаваше абсолютно всеки задължителен елемент на психотрилъра - дори и повече - със своята собствена автентична атмосфера на ретроспекции и обрамчване, романът приема формата на труден пъзел с много частици, които чакат да бъдат наредени на точното място, с ударна презицност!"
1251,Carolina  Proença,"I have absolutely 0 negative things to say about this book. This is the only book that, after I finished it, I wanted to read it again and again! I'm obsessed with it! This is a real thriller, it's so addictive in the end, I couldn't stop reading it. Everything about the story is so architecturally built and it's defininately a book that keeps you guessing and makes you be alert and suspicious of everyone involved! There are secrets, lies, infidelity and so much mystery, it never gets boring. The characters are great and it's one of a few books I can say that the characters are well built, there is a great psychological depth in this book. It's officially one of my favourite books now, the best thriller I have ever read. "
1252,Staci,4.5... couldn't put it down.
1253,Rebecca Clark,"Paula Hawkins creates a psychologically thrilling mystery through the alternating viewpoints of alcoholic Rachel, mentally unstable Megan, and home-wrecker Anna. Each of the three women's lives intersect with each other, resulting in a complex murder-mystery in which each woman finds themselves entangled somehow.Hawkins has a real talent for her beautiful descriptions of mundane tasks. Even an action as simple as Rachel taking a sip of alcohol, or Anna holding her baby Evie, or a description of Megan's appearance, feels magical and meaningful. Hawkins chooses her words and their placement very carefully, ensuring to leave nothing out. Each detail means something and cannot be discounted.Additionally, her characters develop realistically, changing in subtle ways over a believable amount of time. Although the final chapters do feel a bit rushed, the story wraps up neatly, leaving the reader satisfied with the outcome. Although the outcome is unexpected, once again, it feels very believable. Hawkins mixes mystery, the struggles that accompany addiction, and the complexities of love and romance effortlessly throughout the 330 pages of ""The Girl on the Train."""
1254,Heather Neroy,"I could not put this book down. I became an expert in doing things with one hand so I could hold the book in the other hand & read while blow drying my hair, fixing lunch for my kids, brushing my teeth...I feel bad for my family: they didn't see much of me these past 2 days.I picked up the book under the recommendation of ""if you liked Gone Girl you will like The Girl on the Train"" but this was way better than Gone Girl. Seriously. It's not a warm fuzzy feel good but if you are looking for a suspenseful page turner this is the book for you."
1255,Dom,"Twists and turnsTwists and turns. You should expect that from a psychological thriller. And that's exactly what you get. There are a couple of plot elements that are a little repetitive but all in all it was an interesting, dark journey. "
1256,Louise Jones," this was really the most hyped book of 2015 it was everywhere and doubtless will be MADE INTO A BLOCKBUsting film even for people who have not read the book and it will be a runaway success . I must admit i enjoyed the book especially the begining and the same boring commute each day and how we all make stories of the people in the houses we pass or the people we see each day !!! Rachel is the main character on the train and sees things she should,nt going on between characters and is strung into a situation she cant get out of . i know a few people who have read this and most enjoy it but a few not impressed , i am not good at following murder /mystery things so i enjoyed a few people claim to basic .I showed my mum the first chapter and she said had read it before but MAybe confused it with gone girl (not to sure on this )I suppose the main thing u should remember is not to judge on first impressions !!!! oh wonder how many people were annoyed by the comments oh u r a girl reading the girl on a train ( huh sigh)"
1257,Samantha Alvarez,"WOW!! What an Awesome Awesome Read!!! Some compared it to ""Gone Girl"" but this was way BETTER!!! Could NOT put it down!! "
1258,Breader,"This one features a bunch of horrible, messed up, depressing characters with lots of secrets, going about making bad decisions, and living shitty lives. Absolutely nothing redeeming about the characters. This is why some will hate this book. But I have learned to separate despicable characters from an engaging story, and appreciate the story for what it is _engagin. Like watching a train wreck unable to keep ones eyes of it, I was hooked from the beginning to the end. What makes for a great book? It's characters? The story? How well written? What you learn? How well you are entertained? This book grabbed my attention so much so that I found myself skipping meals just cause I don't want to stop reading to cook and feed myself. That said its getting a 5 star from me. I wanted to be entertained and I was."
1259,Cherish,"To anyone wondering if they should read this book, READ IT NOW READ IT RIGHT NOW BUY IT AND READ IT IN ONE SITTING. I almost did. I started one hot evening and finished it the next day around lunch time, only taking a break to sleep. You know how Stephen King has that way of writing that's not necessarily poetic or ultra-quotable, but so INTERESTING that you never feel bored? Paula Hawkins writes like that. She doesn't add any filler or bad metaphors, it's all just story story story and it's extremely addicting.The question I'm about to propose is for those who have already read it and it is NOT SPOILER FREE:Did anyone else see the weird parallels between Megan and Rachel? One was barren and the other lost her child, one was being cheated on and the other was cheating, etc etc.. I thought there was going to be something there, like we find out at the end that they're the same woman, or that Megan was completely made up and was just some sort of sick wish-fulfillment? I don't know, maybe I'm over-analyzing.Anyway, this is one I need to buy for myself so I can reread it every summer. Literally, my only complaint was on the editor's part because there were some typos and weird sentences. I LOVE THIS BOOK."
1260,Kelly,5 stars.
1261,Lisa,You know it's a good book when you can't stop thinking about it when you put it down and can't wait to pick it up again. This is one of those book! Have sat solidly for the last three hours to finish it - something I haven't felt the need to do for a while! Basically it tells the story of three women: Rachel who travels the train every day; the women she sees from the train window sat on her patio every day; and the third the women Rachel's husband had an affair with! One day Rachel sees something from the train that changes everything....
1262,Sophie,Crazy good! 
1263,Briana,"Absolutely insane and intense...I literally read the entire book in 9 hours. I couldn't put it down. If you are into romance, mystery, or thriller stories, this one is definitely a good one. I honestly didn't see it coming. "
1264,Damaskcat,"I didn't think I was going to enjoy this book after I'd read the first chapter and I stopped reading for a couple of weeks but then I went back to it and started reading again and became totally engrossed in it within a few minutes. Rachel travels on the same trains every day and creates an imaginary life for a couple she sees in their house and garden. She calls them Jess and Jason and she thinks they are happy together.Then she see something which upsets all her pre-conceived ideas and it really unsettles her. It is clear to the reader that Rachel has a problem with drinking and is never completely sober and it gradually emerges that her life is not at all what it seems to be at first.When the young woman she has called Jess goes missing, Rachel is obsessed with following the news story and it starts to change her life. We hear from Megan (Jess) and Anna who is now married to Rachel's ex-husband and the story is told by these three woman in turn. What is the truth? What really happened on the night Megan disappeared? Who is telling the truth and who is lying? Are they all lying?I found this book totally compulsive reading after not being able to get into it over the first few pages. I wanted to know what the truth was and I wanted to know about these three women and how they are really connected. I felt sorry for and annoyed with Rachel by turns. I wanted to tell her to get help and sort herself and her life out and her friend Cathy, with whom she lodges, seems to have the same reactions to her.This is a well written novel and I shall definitely be watching out for more books by this author. I received a free copy of this book from NetGalley for review purposes."
1265,Sarah Cradit,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this book. The premise wasn't something that drew me, but the fact that so many of my friends recommended it made me curious.Immediately I was struck by the similarities to Gillian Flynn's novels (mostly in the writing style and the use of mysterious and unreliable narrators). Not at all surprised to come here and see other reviewers are making the same comparisons.The storytelling in the novel was tight; Hawkins tells the story at the right pace, in the right order, revealing different timelines in tandem in a way that unfolds the story wonderfully. I figured out the ""twist"" about halfway through, but only because of her use of misdirection on every character EXCEPT the killer. I wouldn't say it was predictable, though, and right up until the end I still thought things could shift another direction. Everything feels possible.My one beef with this story was (and this is also keeping in tune with Flynn), that every character was unlikable, to the point of being grating. I love a good antagonist or antihero. I love divisive characters. But Rachel's tics and issues became tedious and grating by the end of the book. Megan was an interesting character who warranted further time and explanation because, I suspect, she'd have been incredibly more dynamic than her limited narrative allowed and perhaps more sympathetic as a result. Anna wasn't given enough page time to separate what appeared to be her sociopathic tendencies vs. her love for her child. And the men suffered from similar treatment. Like in any Flynn book, you walk away feeling as if there is no clear winner.That said, this book kept me up all night reading, which is rare for me nowadays, so I can't say the challenges above had a significant impact on my enjoyment. The Girl on the Train is a tightly woven, excellently-paced thriller that I'd recommend to readers who love a great suspenseful read."
1266,Joseph Perkins Jr.,"The Girl On The Train was a doozy of a read. Simply a great thriller. This novel kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. Our main character Rachel travel in and out of London daily. She sees that same people everyday and thinks she knows them as well. One day however, on her daily journey she sees something different, and a bit out of the ordinary. Not knowing exactly what to do, or how to handle the situation she decides to take take action. Her actions thrust her into a chain of events that she may not recover from. A rapid fire suspense thriller. Hawkins tells the story through three female perspectives, Rachel, Megan, and Anna. As the story unravels it takes many twists and turns and the truth is both surprising and mind blowing. Hawkins does a great job building the action and suspense to the final pages and nails it with a superb novel! "
1267,Gina ,"To pass time on her daily commute by train, Rachel looks out the window at the homes along the tracks and becomes attached to the imagined lives of a young couple she calls “Jess and Jason”. A perfect fantasy until she discovers the wife has gone missing and her imagination-turned-fixation gets the better of her. The overwhelming amount of rave reviews this book is getting just weeks after its publication date does not surprise me. Hawkins’ debut is chilling till the very end. Every page of The Girl on the Train is unpredictable, every character, including the three women who narrator the story, is riddled with issues. It’s a tense, emotional read and the less you know about the plot before you pick it up the more entertained you’ll be. A literal page-turner. 5/5 stars. "
1268,Zulya,"I started reading this book and felt disgusted by the main character, Rachel. So miserable, pathetic.. But the sympathy for her builds up quickly.. Until she drinks again!! I was on that roller coaster with her throughout the book. I think author has done a great job describing the state of an alcoholic... It's ugly and scary.The mystery becomes riveting pretty quickly and it gets intense!! I couldn't stop reading!! Such a mess in all those lives, you start doubting your own...The ending is rather disappointing,but I couldn't suggest a better ending.. I don't know the best way to end that story... And 290 pages of a great developing story beats the last 25 of the weak ending..I am very impressed by this book, thank you to Paula Hawkins."
1269,Diana Podea,superba :)
1270,Logan,"buy it Amazing!!! A must read, suspenseful and exciting. Highly recommend it to all! Read it in just over 24 hours. I didn't want it to end."
1271,Sean,"Normally I do not make an effort to read current best-sellers, but I am glad I did this time. Even though I did not like any of the characters at all, I wanted to know more about each one, especially Rachel. A mark of a good writer is the ability to make thoroughly unlikable characters likable. "
1272,Akila Pranathi,"For the first time I did not even bother to check what was the last page number or how many pages were there yet to be read . I loved it to the core , totally !!My favourite line - what is that gap between dreaming and wakefulness"
1273,Laurie,I really enjoyed this book! A great mystery!
1274,Luke A. Bunker,"It's easy to draw parallels between Paula Hawkin's _The Girl on the Train_ and Gillian Flynn's _Gone Girl_. Besides the similarities in title, they both feature complex, psychotic characters (and unreliable narrators) propelled by a quick-moving plot. Both novels are also an investigation into the idea that appearances mean nothing and that carefully-crafted facades can come crashing down with the simplest of interventions. One place where _The Girl on the Train_ easily bests _Gone Girl_, however, is in its logical - yet still shocking and satisfying - ending. Too many otherwise great thrillers climax far before the ending and fall into an unimpressive heap in the final pages. Luckily; this is not the case with _Train_.Comparisons aside, I think we can all relate to the fantasy of ""outside looking in,"" inventing stories about those we encounter during the course of our daily lives. Hawkins takes this concept many steps further and introduces us to Rachel, an alcoholic who has entirely too much history with a certain street in a London suburb, where she observes a couple (she even gives them names: Jess & Jason) from her morning train to a job she no longer has. Her interactions with the characters and the turmoil she faces within herself (to drink, or not to drink? With Rachel, the answer is almost always to drink.), plus our uncertainty of whether or not we can believe what she says, definitely keep this novel interesting! As readers, we get alternating viewpoints every other chapter that lend insight to the house of cards that comes crashing down in the last 20%.I am eager to devour Hawkin's next book. It's not often I stay up until way past my bedtime to finish a book! Good work, Ms. Hawkins."
1275,MishyJo,This was way different than anything I have read in a long time. And I couldn't stop. I was fascinated with how fucked up yet real everyone was. The audiobook narration was EXCELLENT. There were three separate narrators for the 3 POVs which was super helpful. Anna's voice I didn't love but her part was very small. Rachel and Megan's voices were lovely. The British accents were so nice.
1276,Laura Harrison,"Loved it. Many people compare it to Gone Girl. They shouldn't. Yes, it is a whodunnit and there are love/hate interests but that is where the similarities end. I think it is very well written, quickly engrossing and moves faster than Gone Girl. A really great, fun book."
1277,Marsha ,"Hawkins book gets rave reviews. There is a definite reason for the praise. The Girl on the Train is a mystery that keeps you guessing. Megan, Rachel and Anna are all victims. They are humans with flaws and foibles with at least one thing in common. A highly recommended read!!"
1278,Nikki,"A deeply unsympathetic central character might sound off-putting, but Rachel is so human it still draws you in. The archetypal unreliable narrator, she even knows she is unreliable. The use of more than one narrator and time-frame also highlights how important it is to see more than just one side of any story. Great story, constant twists and turns."
1279,Sara Farris,"Dark and twistyI enjoyed this one. I like the way Flynn writes her books, from different character perspectives. Didn't see the end coming either."
1280,Debbie Smith,"Best book of the year! Great characters, great plot, just GREAT!"
1281,Josie Stewart,I held out on reading this book for a very long time. It is very suspenseful and dark but I couldn't but it down. The challenge solving the mystery will keep you reading! 
1282,Veronika,"The book starts with a narration of the girl on the train. She tells us about some things that are happening now and others that happened in the past. Then another narrator chimes in. Then another. And slowly the whole puzzle comes together, and we see how things were interconnected. I loved the pace of the story telling, and overall the book was very engaging. "
1283,Terry Blankenship,"This book took a little while for me to get into, however the velocity really swept me up once I was about a fourth of the way into it. A new writer, Paula Hawkins does an incredible job of weaving disparate points of view into a truly thrilling and gripping story. Not the same old warm oatmeal, she is an extremely refreshing writer!"
1284,Abbie,"There is a reason this is the #1 best seller right now. Pick it up, you won't be able to put it down"
1285,Brigitte Cranmer,I couldn't put it down. I had to know!!
1286,Delilah,"This book is a hell of a ride. On a train. Just kidding ...but seriously, this book is a heck of thriller. I honestly haven't enjoyed a book in this genre this much since ...wait for it....Gone Girl (I know that's such a cliche). There are so many twists and turns, characters you feel sorry for, then immediately hate, but then truly love all in a matter of pages. It's a very dark book and while the ending is well written, it's predictable. I guessed it with about 75 pages left (to contrast with Gone Girl as I was shocked to the very last page). But it's definitely a 5 star in my book and highly recommend!!"
1287,Greta,Whew.
1288,Emer Owens,I read this book in a day and a half. It was incredible. It's now 2am and I will not be able to sleep for a good while after finishing this. I am pleasantly terrified.
1289,Gail McKelvie,I love books like this! I just love how fast paced and mysterious it was and I also just love an unreliable narrator. Highly recommend to someone who wants a fast read or someone who just loves suspense! 
1290,Paul Burnette,"The trouble with idle imagination is that it gets you deeply into situations when you have only a small understanding or even a BIG MISUNDERSTANDING of what is really going on. This situation gets even more complicated when the misunderstandings are multiplied by three different narrators, Rachel, Megan, and Anna, each with her own assumptions and misunderstandings about the other two. And when one is an alcoholic (not recovering, unfortunately), and the other two are seductresses caught in love triangles with one another’s husbands, friends, and therapists, then it gets really complicated trying to figure out what’s real and what was only imagined or misunderstood. That this entire narration is so interesting, really so captivating, is to the credit of author Hawkins’ considerable skills. Not a comic, but a tragic tale, and well worth the time."
1291,Kalen,"Super fun straight-up thriller. Rachel is the best-drawn of the characters (most are pretty flat) and Hawkins does a great job of creating a person who feels so real, so flawed. If you like your fiction fast-paced and plot-driven, this is your book. I went in a little leery because of all of the hype and then because of the backlash against the hype but I read this in a few short bursts over 24 hours. It was hard to put down. It isn't the next Gone Girl, and in fact, didn't really remind me at all of GG. I guess anything that is dark and disturbing is going to be called the next GG? Pick it up and decide for yourself but in my opinion, this one is worthy of the hype. (And will make a great movie.) "
1292,Jeanine Feunekes,"HET MEISJE IN DE TREIN – PAULA HAWKINSDe cover is zonder meer schitterend. De letters van de titel zijn op een aparte en originele manier weergegeven op een zwarte ondergrond: als een voorbijrazende trein. Onder de letters zelf zie je de voorbij rijdende trein. De letters zijn wit en het lijkt net alsof ze met de trein meerijden. De ondertitel is in een standard lettertype weergegeven, ook in wit: JE KENT HAAR NIET.MAAR ZE WEET PRECIES WIE JIJ BENT.Onderaan de cover staat de naam van de schrijfster, in okergeel. Ik geef de cover een dikke 9.Voordat het daadwerkelijke verhaal begint zijn er 2 pagina’s met op elke pagina een kort stukje. Ze zijn beide zeer spannend geschreven en het smaakt direct naar meer. De spanning loopt op door deze 2 stukjes en maakt je nieuwsgierig naar de rest van het boek.Het verhaal: Rachel neemt elke dag de trein van Ashbury naar London en ’s avonds weer terug voor haar werk. Elke dag komt ze langs het huis in Witney waar ze met haar ex-man Tom heeft gewoond. Die relatie is 2 jaar eerder door haar man verbroken. Rachel was door emotionele problemen aan de drank geraakt en haar man kon het niet meer aan. Hij bleek ondertussen al een tijd een minnares te hebben. Inmiddels is hij met haar (Anna) getrouwd en heeft een gezinnetje gesticht. Dit kan Rachel maar moeilijk verkroppen. Het voelt nog steeds als haar huis en als haar man. Op momenten dat Rachel stomdronken is, belt ze ook met regelmaat naar haar ex en dat verontrust Toms nieuwe echtgenote Anna erg .Enkele huizen verderop, in dezelfde straat, woont een stel dat zij als idealistisch en perfect beschouwd, een beetje zoals haar leven met Tom vroeger was. Ze noemt het stel Jess en Jason. Rachel kijkt ook elke dag op heen- en terugreis naar hun huis en fantaseert over het prachtige leven dat dit stel zou kunnen hebben.Op een dag ziet ze iets vreemds in de tuin. Het zit Rachel niet lekker en ze gaat op een avond naar Witney om achter antwoorden te komen. De volgende dag wordt Rachel wakker met een black-out. Waarschijnlijk door haar overmatige drankgebruik. Als later blijkt dat Jess sinds die avond vermist is, stapt Rachel naar de politie. Ze trekken haar tip na over wat ze eerder die week overdag gezien heeft in de tuin van Jess, maar de politie kan uiteindelijk niks met deze tip. Rachel wordt vanaf dat moment beschouwd als een onbetrouwbare getuige, aan de drank en mogelijk geestelijk instabiel.Rachel gaat zelf op onderzoek uit naar wat er die bewuste die bewuste zaterdagavond gebeurd kan zijn.Conclusie/mening: Het boek bestaat uit meerdere verhalen met verschillende tijdlijnen. Ten eerste het verhaal van Rachel, dat begint op Vrijdag 5 juli 2013. Verder is er het verhaal van Megan (Rachel noemt haar Jess). Dit verhaal begint een jaar eerder op woensdag 16 mei 2012.Elk hoofdstuk, beginnend met een datum, bestaat uit de onderdelen “ochtend” en “avond”. Heel af en toe zit er een deel “middag” bij.De twee tijdlijnen en de levens van beide karakters komen langzamerhand bij elkaar. Deze manier van vertellen is heel bijzonder, de schrijfster bouwt zo heel knap de spanning op. Op zaterdag 20 juli 2013 komen de tijdlijnen van Rachel en Megan samen en komt er een nieuw verhaallijn bij: Anna, de huidige vrouw van Tom. Ook bij haar dezelfde indeling: ”ochtend” en “avond” en af en toe “middag”. Zaterdag 20 juli 2013 is de datum dat Jess/Megan verdwijnt. Megans verhaallijn blijft hierna in het verleden doorlopen. Die van Rachel en Anna lopen nu gelijk qua tijd.Het verhaal zit als een perfecte puzzel in elkaar. Alle kleine details blijken achteraf van belang te zijn en het geheel valt uiteindelijk aan het eind perfect in elkaar. Je wordt meerdere keren tijdens het lezen op het verkeerde been gezet. Elke keer als je denkt dat je weet hoe het in elkaar steekt, volgt er een nieuwe verrassing. Het boek is goed geschreven, gedetailleerd, spannend. Elke keer blijken situaties in het boek anders in elkaar te zitten dan je daarvoor dacht. Heel knap gedaan.Uiteindelijk komen de verhaallijnen dus samen en de schrijfster heeft geen steek laten vallen. Het verhaal is uitstekend opgezet.Eén klein minpuntje: de ondertitel klopt niet voor 100% als je het boek uit hebt. Rachel weet niet precies wie “JIJ” bent. Ze fantaseert bijvoorbeeld over Jess, die dus Megan blijkt te zijn. De ondertitel is wel begrijpelijk omdat ze het op deze manier nèt iets spannender maken. Het stoort dan ook absoluut niet voor het leesplezier en ik geef het prachtige debuut dan ook met veel plezier 5 sterren. "
1293,Megan Ellingsen,"Loved it, psychological thriller that turned my assumptions upside down."
1294,L.C. Julia,"Acabo de terminarlo o.o. Dios, que buen libro que fue este. La verdad que al principio no había sentido gran emoción, pero como todo fue desarrollandose hacia el final fue excelente. Tenía dudas de todos, quería leer capitulo tras capitulo y la última parte... asombrosa. Realmente uno de los mejores policiales que leí estos últimos días. "
1295,Rebecca Schatzle,I liked this book more than Gone Girl. I wouldn't have predicted the ending. Couldn't put it down!
1296,Suvishka,"Awesome book, kept me hooked right to the end."
1297,Anjali  Shankar,"Couldn't put it down!Intriguing, suspenseful, thrilling, and deeply captivating, this is a book you won't be able to put down. Reminiscent of Gone Girl but great in its own right, I'd highly recommend this, if not for the story, then for the complexity of its leading character."
1298,Vivienne,AAlthough I had only read this a few months ago when it was selected by one of my reading groups I elected to re-read. I felt it held up very well for a second reading though I still felt exasperated by Rachel's drinking.It was well received by the group though we all agreed that all the main characters were hard to like much. We ended up talking about our own experiences of drinking to excess - in our younger wilder days and wondering whether the degree of drinking Rachel was doing was realistic in terms of the effects. It was a fun discussion and certainly collectively we agreed the novel deserved the popularity it had gained since publication. 
1299,Seif Eddine,"Great thriller with a great plot twist that I did not see coming, I loved this book."
1300,Sarah Gregory,"Excellent twist, didn't see it coming. Loved this book!"
1301,Kevin Tiemeyer,"There is much buzz in the book and it was well worth it. Usually in some suspense books, the who, what, why is hinted at but you never know until close to the end. Authors handle this differently -- either memory loss or someone not being up front. What was unique about this story was the protagonist is an alcoholic and it is during a blackout when the mystery takes place. So she is trying to figure out what happened during her blackout. It is much more than that. It is an interesting character study on an alcoholic who is a depression since her husband left her and having other life problems. It is also the story of the 2 of the other woman in the book, the new wife as well as the missing woman who lives near the protagonists ex. I would say those looking for something a little different and in the mystery/suspense genre, you would not be disappointed. Well maybe you will but I liked it :)"

1303,Ira  Marby,"Unpredictable! Saya rekomendasikan untuk yang suka romance thriller. Cara Hawkins membuka fakta di buku ini keren banget. Bahkan saya sendiri ga nyangka ending ceritanya seperti itu.Awal mula yang sederhana, kemudian kita dibawa ke dalam kesemrawutan konflik semua tokoh, sampai menjumpai akhir yang tak terduga. Lumayan mengaduk emosi.Semua tokoh menyebalkan. Wkwk.. aduh maaf ya. Tapi memang begitulah kenyataannya. Ga ada satupun tokoh di buku ini yang patut dijadikan contoh, sekalipun tokoh utamanya. Mungkin gara-gara itu mengaduk emosi saya :pBuku ini diceritakan dengan 3 POV ; Rachel, Anna, dan Megan. Penyampaian dengan 3 POV ini tidak membingungkan, karena dipisahkan dengan label nama dan tanggal. Walaupun saya sempet bolak balik juga lihat tanggalnya :D But It’s not a big deal. Ga bakal mengurangi bintang yang saya kasih ke buku ini. 5 stars, Thank you, Paula. "
1304,Tamara,"Zuerst einmal zum Cover und dem Titel: Beides passt wie die Faust aufs Auge! Finde ich super gewählt. Mehr ist dazu auch nicht zu sagen.Dann möchte ich dieses Mal unbedingt zu den ersten Sätzen des Buches ein paar Worte verlieren bzw. abschreiben. Schon nachdem ich sie gelesen hatte wusste ich, dass ich dieses Buch lieben werde und deshalb sind sie heute so wichtig. Vielen gefällt der beschreibende protokollartige Stil nicht auf Anhieb und sie müssen sich erst hineinfinden. Für mich war es Liebe auf den ersten Blick.Da liegt ein Kleiderhaufen an den Gleisen. Hellblauer Stoff - vielleicht ein Hemd -, verknäult mit etwas schmutzig Weißem. Wahrscheinlich ist es nur Abfall, irgendwas aus einem Müllsack, der heimlich in das zugewucherte Waldstück oben am Bahndamm geschleudert wurde. Oder die Sachen wurden von einem der Arbeiter dort liegen gelassen, die am Streckenabschnitt beschäftigt sind. Schließlich sind sie oft genug hier. Vielleicht war es aber auch ganz anders. Meine Mutter meinte immer, ich hätte eine zu lebhafte Fantasie; Tom meinte das auch. Aber ich kann einfach nicht anders, ich sehe ein paar liegengebliebene Fetzen, ein schmutziges T-Shirt oder einen Schuh und muss sofort an den zweiten Schuh denken und an die Füße, die darin gesteckt haben. Ich habe mich von meinem Sofa direkt in die Szene gerissen gefühlt und war von der ersten Sekunde an in der Atmosphäre der Geschichte gefangen.Erzählt wird die Geschichte zunächst aus der Perspektive von Rachel, sowie Megan, die Rachel zunächst Jess nennt, weil ihr Megan's richtiger Name nicht bekannt ist. Schon die ersten Kapitel bauen eine so gewaltige Spannung auf, dass ich es fast nicht ausgehalten habe zwischen dem Lesen auch noch arbeiten zu gehen! Aus Rachels Sicht läuft Jess' äääh Megan's Leben einfach perfekt: ein toller Mann, ganz sicher einen tollen Job und natürlich ein schönes Haus - in der Straße, in der Rachel früher selbst gewohnt hat, als ihr Leben noch in Ordnung war. Aus der Sicht von Megan sieht das alles weniger perfekt aus: Ihr Mann ist oft unterwegs, mit ihm läuft es nicht immer rund und besonders Geschehnisse aus ihrer Vergangenheit belasten sie sehr. Genau das macht das Buch aus: Die verschiedenen Blickwinkel, später auch aus Anna's Sicht, der Nachfolgerin von Rachel in Sachen Ex-Mann Tom.Das Buch ist auf so vielen Ebenen spannend, ich kann es gar nicht in Worte fassen. Die Charaktere sind toll ausgearbeitet, besitzen Tiefe (außer Cathy vielleicht) und gewinnen den Leser für sich. Auch oder vielleicht gerade Rachel, als sehr ungewöhnliche Hauptdarstellerin mit Alkoholproblem, arbeitslos und einem gewissen Hang zur Depression und Antriebslosigkeit, lässt keinen kalt.Ganz langsam wird man gegen Ende zur Lösung geführt, und auch wenn man die Wahrheit dann endlich begriffen hat bleibt die Spannung nicht weg, sondern dann geht es erst richtig los.Vollkommen zu Recht ist dieses Buch nicht nur auf der Bestseller-Liste des Spiegels mehrere Wochen die Nr.1 gewesen.Die Geschichte ist unglaublich spannend, so dass man das Buch nicht mehr weglegen kann, ein absoluter Pageturner. Ich kann nur allen Freunden von Krimis und Thrillern empfehlen sich das Buch auf dem schnellsten Wege zu kaufen und unter keinen Umständen länger zu warten, denn es ist tatsächlich so: Ihr verpasst sonst was.Mehr zu sagen bleibt mir nicht. Vom Inhalt möchte ich schließlich nichts verraten, aber das Buch ist wirklich super und auf jeden Fall 5 Bäumchen und den Kauf wert."
1305,Liam,"I was utterly hooked on this book from start to finish! What an incredible journey full of tension and late nights this book took me on...Admittedly, I had high hopes going into this book as it has been said to be as good as Gone Girl. Let me tell you, it was as good as Gone Girl and maybeee even a little bit better!At times I tried to guess how the story will end but eventually I just gave up because every single time I thought I knew everything I was completely wrong. The story was incredible and so complex that I literally couldn't put this book down!The main characters throughout the book are not the most likeable I have to say but they were all so intriguing and I just couldn't trust any of them.Wish I could read this for the first time again and experience everything once more. Honestly, this book is fantastic!! If you want to have a few sleepless nights reading because you're so incredibly hooked on a book then this book is for you! The pacing was so fast and I got completely lost in the story.I will not be forgetting this book any time soon. And I will, from now on, be a little more cautious when looking out the train window..."
1306,Amy Lotsberg,"Well, I mentioned earlier that I didn't really like any of the characters and now that it's over I still don't. However....this was a GREAT read! Suspenseful and a good ride. I did guess the killer ahead of time, but it was still fun to watch it unravel. I would love to read more by this author."
1307,Lenoir,"I could not put this book down. I have heard comparisons to Gone Girl but although I can see the writing style (unreliable narrators and alternating points of view) as similar I found the things this book has that Gone Girl is missing is someone to root for and a satisfying ending. The story alternates between Rachel, Megan and Anna. Rachel is a hot mess and an alcoholic who on her daily train ride to London passes a house and imagines she knows the couple who lives there. She invents a whole wonderful life for them. Megan, who is the woman who lives in the house Rachel watches actually has a far less than perfect life. Anna is Rachel's ex-husband's new wife, former mistress and neighbor of Megan."
1308,Gozde Turker,"Bu kitap ruyalarima girdi, kabusum oldu. Okudugum en akici polisiye/gizem romaniydi - belki de ruh halimden filan kaynaklandi ama kitap cok fena akti gitti :D Hatta bir bolumde aglatti bile. Bilmiyorum belki tahmin etmesi kolay bir olaydi ama ben hic bu tur kitaplarda dogru tahminlerde bulunamiyorum. Bu yuzden kitaba benden bes yildiz :D not : bu kitaptan sonra evlilikten korkuyorum. evlilik hakkinda fena suphelerim var :D"
1309,Agnieszka,"A must read! In my opinion, way better than Gone Girl. The entire story plot kept your mind alert and thinking what would happen next. After I would turn a page, I would be in awe that something happened because it was the last thing I was expecting. Towards the end of the book, I was in utter shock that Tom was the crazy one. All this time, mentally draining all these women, after he was the nut case all along. He deserved the corkscrew in the neck...bastard. Won't go into too much detail in order not to spoil the book too much. But 5/5 in my eyes, one of the best books I've read in awhile. would not mind re-reading it either! I hope the author comes out with more books! I'm a huge fan!"
1310,Rose,"Sometimes you read a book that's been hyped up and you can't figure out why. Sometimes it's awful. Sometimes it's OK. And sometimes, just once in a while, you find one that is truly deserving of all the attention. The Girl on the Train is one of those.The story is told from three points of view but the primary narrater is Rachel. She's been divorced for a couple of years but still intensely in love with her ex. She is an alcoholic who occasionally suffers blackouts. She takes the train every morning and afternoon to keep up the pretence that she is still going to work - that she hadn't been fired for wandering in drunk and losing an account. She has made up a fantasy about a couple she sees every day from the train who just happen to live a few houses down from her ex-husband, from her old house. One day, she sees something different with the house she watches. Then a news report comes out that the woman is missing. Because of this, she inserts herself into the life of the husband while simultaneously causing an uproar in the life of her ex and his new wife.I know this sounds very chic-lit but it turned very dark. A 'who done it' as mainly told from the perspective of a drunk who is never sure if the bits of memory she has are real or imagined. It was a real page-turner and a story I just could not put down until I learned the truth. I highly recommend it!!"
1311,Debra,"Thoroughly enjoyed it; better than Gone Girl. For a 1st book, Paula Hawkins kept me interested the entire read. Congratulations to her!"
1312,Linda Johnson-dynek,"Fast, couldn't-put-it-down read. "
1313,Krystal,"This was such a brilliantly written book. The story line flowed together effortlessly in a way that made it more than difficult to not keep turning page after gripping page.This story, written in somewhat of a diary format, primarily follows Rachel, an alcoholic divorcee on her quest to recover memories lost to the liquor bottle, one of which has her wrapped up in a murder so close to her mind she can barely believe it is real...Barely. During the pages of this book we also meet Anna, the shameless mistress her husband ran off with, and Meghan the innocent (or is she?) woman who you need to read this story for.This is hands down one of the best books I have read this year. If not ever. I highly recommend this to anyone looking to get deep into a story that leaves you questioning everything you thought to be true until the very last page."
1314,Rhea,"I bought this book because of all the great reviews and the comparison to ""Gone Girl"" (which is the only Gillian Flynn book I liked) but this book surpasses it. The plot is intricately woven with the narration of three women and their intersecting lives. The story is suspenseful, smart and I couldn't put the book down until I was finished. There are twists and turns and though I did figure out who the killer was and why, it was still exciting and even more twisty than I imagined.Truly, I don't understand all the negative reviews but so many seem to be based on the characters' personalities and weaknesses. I'm sorry but this is a murder mystery filled with flawed people which is truly realistic. What were readers expecting? Heroes and perfect, moral characters? How boring would that be as well as unrealistic. So many main characters in literature are flawed, imperfect, weak, tragic, and broken. It's sad that so many people think a character who was abused or who has a drinking problem isn't work reading about or listening to. Each character in this book has their flaws which come out here and there throughout the book, making you realize that what you thought you knew, you didn't know at all. It's also incredible to me that the same people who complained about the flawed characters were also offended by the comparison to ""Gone Girl."" Because the characters in that book weren't flawed with infidelity, psychopathy and more? The characters in this book are far more redeemable. I loved this book. I would recommend it to anyone and I can't wait to read the next book by this author! "
1315,Maarten Steinfort,"This was a marathon. At one side I couldn't stop reading while changing theories a dozen times on how the story could end and the mystery could solved. At the other side I wanted to give me some more time to think about it more and process the things what I just read. In the beginning of the book I almost felt depressed like Rachel did as the reader is really taken into her mind. The perspective on sitting in the train changes as well as the need for alcohol does. I didn't know where the story was heading to in the first quarter of the book. I would say it builds slowly, but then it happens so quickly. The other 3 quarters of the book, sprinting through the pages and not looking backwards until you finished it. Then you'll have time to think, plenty time. In the end, I think this is a very good story, although it is not that innovative as I expected to be. But hey, I enjoyed every single page reading it. It is a thriller story, with a lot of drama build around it in a way that every detail serves as a clue or cause for what happens later. Also things become so personal, like you ask yourself if it is based on personal experiences of the writer. The lies build on lies, becoming bigger lies. The stupid and hazardous actions, of whose you know you'll regret them later. This is a very good book, with a nice story, I liked it. "
1316,Victoria Briseno,"This book has been on my TBR shelf since it first made the New York Times Bestseller list. Considering the fact that it costs about $10 just for the ebook, I was a bit apprehensive about spending that much for an author I had never read before. That is until the Gods of eBook Sales and Impoverished College Students shined down on the reader world and put this book on sale for a limited time. I grabbed it as soon as I could!I will not lie. The first 20% of the book I was pretty confused. I wasn’t sure exactly where the novel was headed or what exactly was going on. My thoughts were pretty jumbled. However, that did not lessen my interest in the book whatsoever! If anything, it only raised the amount of suspense and intrigue. I ended up finishing the entire book in about a day and a half.I’m gonna try and give you my review without spoiling anything for you which is not an easy task and you will see why once you read it.We get three different points of view from Rachel, Megan and Anna. One startling aspect about this novel that surprised me was that you will not view these women as productive citizens of the world or as role models in any way, shape or form. They are incredibly flawed and have a boat load of issues. Let’s sum up these three characters:Rachel:Rachel is the main protagonist. She is The girl on the train. She has suffered from alcoholism for several years. She has been fired from her job and basically ostracized from her former friends due to her drinking addiction. Her life is not going anywhere at the time of these events. She’s lost control over many facets and cannot seem to find the strength or the will to get her life back on track (no pun intended). She spends every single day riding the train and wasting time. She likes to see a particular couple on her daily commute who live right by the train tracks. She fantasizes about what their lives must be like until one day she sees something shocking and feels the need to intervene. It was difficult to like Rachel at times because she makes many mistakes throughout the course of the novel. I understand why she did them, but at the same time I wanted so badly to shake her by the shoulders to make her stop spiraling downward.Megan:Megan is one-half of the couple that Rachel likes to watch on her commute. She seems to have the perfect life according to Rachel’s fantasies. She is married to Scott – a handsome man who showers her with affection. However, as the novel progresses we get to see a side of Megan that is filled with the negative consequences from her dark past.Anna:Anna is yet another character that is difficult to like. She is the bitter enemy of Rachel. She is constantly looking for ways to get Rachel out of her life for good. She also happens to be one of the reasons why Rachel is so utterly miserable. Anna was the mistress that helped destroy Rachel’s marriage and is now married to Tom (Rachel’s ex-husband) and lives just a few houses down from Megan and Scott.On a seemingly normal day, Rachel witnesses events that entwine all of their lives together and will test each of their bonds and sanity.I don’t think I have ever had so many theories for just one novel in my life! It seemed as if every few pages I was adding a new theory to the mix. I must give Paula credit for being able to successfully keep me on my toes. By the end, I really had no idea who the culprit was and since all of the characters are flawed, it made it even harder to narrow it down.This book has been repeatedly compared to Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn. Gone Girl is one of my favorite books and I was a bit skeptical that The Girl on the Train would live up to its standards. However, I can completely understand why those comparisons were made now that I have read the book. They do not have the same plot or similar characters, but both books give off a certain vibe. They are both psychological thrillers that will keep you guessing the entire time."
1317,Clee000,"Omg i just finished this. including the fact that im sooo busy with school stuff,i could say that i finished this book so so fast! And i loooooveeeeddd it! That plow thought of my gosh fantastic.For all you who havent read this book or for all of you others who have really low ratings about it,i suggest you reread it again.this book has very complex charachters that have a great character development throught the reading. its a very very deep book and also complicated,you should read it very slow to understand every word and every action.when i was reading it i was in a such a diffwrent world,it happened like i was there at the moment and it was smth i havent expirienced in the past books that i've been reading lately. Toatally a 5 star rating,and i would totally recommand this book to anyone who likes complex books and is a great fan of phsycological thrillers just like me :)"
1318,Adrienne Thompson,"A wonderfully woven tale of intersecting lives, secrets, betrayals, and jaw-dropping revelations!! One of the best thrillers I've read in a long time. Kudos to the author!! I highly recommend this book--a must read!!Adrienne ThompsonAuthor of See Me"
1319,Lyssa,"I picked this book up not knowing that I would be instantly gripped. I couldn't put it down until I read the last word!! ""Girl on the Train"" is creepy and filled with desperate characters. Nothing and no one are what they first appear and the plot twists in disturbing ways. The fantasies people create in a state of pain and desperate loneliness are dangerous indeed. "
1320,Eileen Patterson,"Unreliable but not UnreadableI admit, the title of this book interested me, but when people told me the story featured an unreliable narrator, I stayed away. Books with unreliable narrators can be good, don't get me wrong, but there are so many bad ones that I'm leery of buying one and wasting my money and time. This book finally won me over though, and I'm so glad I gave it a chance, because it really is a great book.At first I was very confused, of course, given that the narrator's of the story don't know what's going on themselves, but I was also trying to read the book a chapter at a time over different days, and that doesn't help with the confusion. This book is best read in one sitting, which suited me anyway because I found it almost impossible to put down. There's violence, of course, and some of the characters are exasperating at times, but the book is so well written that it's definitely worth a read."
1321,Andy Madajski,"I enjoyed this. I think I would have enjoyed it more had there not been so many Gone Girl comparisons made by the critics. This had me expecting and waiting for the shocking character twist. It came, and I probably would have been shocked hadi not expected it. I liked the narration constantly shifted back and forth between three characters. The dramatic irony really kept the plot nicely paced and moving. Even though the main character Rachel was a pathetic loser, I found myself becoming more and more sympathetic as the novel progressed. I won't say that she redeemed herself at the end, but I did feel she deserved the respite from unhappiness that she ended up with. I also think that canned gin and tonics sound like a really interesting idea. "
1322,Emily Graves,"This was a delightfully twisty thriller. I wasn't so sure because it kept getting compared to Gone Girl, which I hated, but I hated it because it didn't hold up and the characters didn't hold me either. This isn't the case for ""The Girl on the Train"" where I was kept up half the night with a need to know what on earth was happening.It's all told in first-person by increasingly unreliable narrators, as their lives and worlds are called into question. I think you could do a personality test on women by asking who, out of the three main female characters and the three narrators, who you found most sympathetic. For me it was definitely Megan, who's pain and independence really drew me in.Without giving too much away, I'd say that it felt like Broadchurch meets Pretty Little Liars on a train...the narrators are dealing with secrets, lies, and crimes that get increasingly complex, combat with police who don't seem to understand while trying to protect themselves and their families from those same police, and try to come to terms with disturbing revelations about themselves and those they love. Very satisfying read!"
1323,Drew Forster,"Listened to the MP3 audio book, which is how I consume many books these days. I highly recommend listening to Girl on the Train as the voice work is excellent.Read this in 5 days, so obviously I loved it. The POV style here is fascinating because rather than a typical story told by multiple characters in which the truth remains regardless of character, the incomplete/inaccurate knowledge of each voice makes for a much more gripping tale. In addition, this unique use of POV feels far more true to life in that no one ever truly knows another person's motive or true self. The series of misinterpretations indeed becomes part of the narrative and clouds the truth very effectively to keep the reader engaged.Beyond the human characters, I was also struck by the inanimate characters in this story: the train, the gray restless sea, the rain. More than background or context, they influence the story in real ways.The Girl on the Train reads like a story based on true events, each character utterly believable. I found myself casting the movie and feel like we can bank on that happening in the near future."
1324,Beckie,"Couldn't put it down. Couldn't wait to get to the end to see if I'd guessed ""who-dun-it"". Loved the way it was written. Loved the ending. Highly recommend."
1325,Domonique,"Such a good read I didn't want it to endMan, this was a good book! It reminded me a little bit of Gone Girl, parts of it anyway: the relationship between Megan and Scott and how she couldn't seem to be happy with one. Although in this story, she didn't turn out to be the crazy one. At first I didn't know why we needed Anna's poverty but as I got further into the book, it made more sense. She had a story to tell, just like the other two. And I think, without her part, the stories wouldn't have been as connected, especially Rachel's and the ending might not have been as great. And the ending took me surprise although I had narrowed down my list of suspects to two, but I still couldn't believe who the culprit turned out to be. The writing was so engaging that I felt like I was on the train with Rachel, I can't wait to see what this author comes up with next!"
1326,Ismaa Khan,"Why five stars? Cause I loved it. It knocked my socks off, if I wore socks that is! (but I don't and insist on running around barefoot in the house)I was in the mood for a good thriller and I guess I found it. Didn't have high hopes for the book as its been given mixed reviews and compared ""a lot"" to Gone Girl, and with a mixed review book it can go either way. Main characters are gritty and un-likeable which really works for the story, the plot is simple in hindsight, but has been given great twists and turns by the author and keeps you guessing till the end. Pace of the book is good and it doesn't get boring or drag needlessly. That is exactly what one wants from a mystery/thriller. Its not high prose but its well written and kept me hooked and that's all I wanted, so five stars. "
1327,Albert,"The Girl On The Train by Paula Hawkins is so good that you have to occasionally remind yourself that this is her debut novel. A fact that should have all mystery readers excited for what is to come!Rachel rides the commuter train every morning, passing a stretch of suburbia she once belonged to. She watches the couples in their homes. One she knows too well and the other she dreams about. Her dream couple is Jason and Jess. They are idyllic. In love, young, attentive, with their whole lives ahead of them. The other couple are Tom and Anna and they are why her life is destroyed.""..I am not the girl I used to be. I am no longer desirable, I'm off-putting in some way. It's not just that I've put on weight, or that my face is puffy from the drinking and the lack of sleep; it's as if people can see the damage written all over me, can see it in my face, the way I hold myself, the way I move. On night last week, when I left my room to get myself a glass of water, I overheard Cathy talking to Damien, her boyfriend, in the living room. I stood in the hallway and listened. 'She's lonely,' Cathy was saying. 'I really worry about her. It doesn't help, her being alone all the time.' Then she said, 'Isn't there someone from work, maybe, or the rugby club?' and Damien said, 'For Rachel? Not being funny, Cath, but I'm not sure I know anyone that desperate...""Rachel was married to Tom once. Then Anna came along and then the baby and Rachel was left. Tossed aside. For a younger, prettier, fertile version of herself. Now every morning, as she rides the train. She watches as she passes by their lives; going on. Passing her by. But truth be told, Rachel doesn't always just pass by. Sometimes she gets off. Sometimes she goes to Tom and Anna's home. Angry. Hurt. Drunk. But then, Rachel is always drunk now. Drunk and broken. With a memory missing large chunks from it.""...One for sorrow, two for joy, three for a girl...Three for a girl. I'm stuck on three, I just can't get any further. My head is thick with blood. Three for a girl. I can hear the magpies-they're laughing, mocking me, a raucous cackling. A tiding. Bad tidings. I can see them now, black against the sun. Not the birds, something else. Someone's coming. Someone is speaking to me. Now look. Now look what you made me do...""Rachel is failing at moving on. Too tired and too often too drunk to make anything of her life. That is why she needs Jason and Jess. Her perfect couple. They lead the life she once had. Until the day. Until she sees something from the train that changes everything. But who will believe her. Who will trust her. The Girl on the Train is compelling and emotionally taxing. You will be angry and at once supportive of Rachel as she tries to piece together what she believes she has seen through the fog of her alcohol impaired memories. She is at times so damaged, that there is a sense of overwhelming hopelessness, which is what makes her attempts to do the right thing so courageous. Or is she simply fighting for attention. To matter once again when she is devoid of any self worth.There is also a real mystery here. The story told through the voices of three women. Rachel, Anna and Megan. Each with their own demons. Each with their own self afflictions. Each trying to make the most of their bad decisions.But it is Rachel who drives the train so to speak, Rachel who must set right the wrong she knows has happened. Rachel that makes the Girl on the Train so unforgettable.A terrific debut. A terrific read! "
1328,Tracy Little,Very interesting..many twists and turns...and some hard moments to read through as well. Kept me very engaged. Well-written. 
1329,Ornella Calcagnile,"Recensione completa http://peccati-di-penna.blogspot.it/2...Il romanzo mette in moto la mente, il lettore inizia a sospettare di tutti e a ipotizzare, così come fa la protagonista. Ho trovato la lettura intrigante e appassionante, molto fruibile e godibile, per nulla pesante. Ovviamente, oltre ai lati positivi di questa lettura trainante, ci sono alcuni negativi: reputo alcuni passaggi sono un po’ confusi, la narrazione avviene attraverso 3 POV: Rachel, la protagonista; Anna, la nuova moglie di Tom, terrorizzata da Rachel; Megan, la ragazza scomparsa misteriosamente. Oltre a questi cambi di personaggio abbiamo anche passaggi dal presente al passato. Insomma, questi salti destabilizzano, ma niente di eclatante.La ragazza del treno mi è piaciuto molto, se come me non siete lettori di thriller questo potrebbe essere un romanzo di iniziazione. Scoprite anche voi che fine farà Rachel e dov'è finita Megan!"
1330,Kelli Nina Perkins,"The premise of The Girl on the Train is intriguing from the very beginning. We all have an inner voyeur which draws us to the lives of others. Rachel gives in to hers with a spectacular display of inventive fantasy, making up alternate universes to make sense of the lives she sees played out each day as her train passes by. When one of her favorite characters disappears, she is compelled to launch herself into the lives of those she used to watch from afar. Will she find that their reality is aligned with her made up stories, or will roles be reversed? Is the missing woman a victim or a perpetrator? Is Rachel herself a credible witness to the events passing by on the train? Complex, character-driven and speeding like a freight train, The Girl on the Train is a wild and entertaining mystery ride. I loved it from beginning to end. Despite the quicksilver pace, the various mysteries unraveled agonizingly slowly. The voice alternates between three women: Rachel, our nosy traveler; Anna, her ex's new wife; and Megan, the missing girl. Each woman steps forward and tells her tale and the story comes together one bit at a time to the stunning conclusion. Recommended for those who enjoyed Before I Go to Sleep and The Silent Wife. "
1331,Luke West,"How can you despise every character yet feel sorry for them just a few sentences later? How can you clutch onto their every move yet give up on them in a heartbeat? This is ""The Girl on the Train"" and this is an Author that knows how to write a true page turner. A fantastic novel written with such precision that it simply leaves you dumbfounded every step of the way. You think you have it all figured out but the Author throws a curveball that puts you back at the start. A truly fantastic read, recommended to all those who love a page turner or those craving a bit of uncertainty in their lives. "
1332,Victoria Scott,Simply brilliant. 
1333,Molly Carroll,"I literally couldn't put this book down! I, ironically, started reading it on my train to university and spent the majority of the day waiting for lectures to end so I could get back to it!The characters, Rachel and Megan/Jess in particular, are brilliantly thought out, and despite their flaws and mistakes it was difficult to dislike any of them. The twists and turns never stopped, but, unlike in some books, they didn't feel as though they were added just to throw the reader, but as if, should you look back, you would see all the clues fitting together perfectly!This is a fantastic book and one, if I may say so, that I feel would be adapted into a fantastic film too!5/5 would recommend!"

1335,Em,It was amazing. Loved this book!
1336,Rebekah,"4.5. I really liked this book. The narrators were all horrible, complete assholes. It felt like a combination of Gone Girl and Before I Go to Sleep, but good. The pacing was great, it was entertaining, it kept me reading and guessing. "
1337,Katie Kipe,"We’re all guilty of it. The house on the corner, a jogger you pass every morning; each are given a place in your own little universe. Your mind fantasizes names and back stories. You’ll never actually visit that house or have a conversation with the runner, but you know them. But what if one day you woke to find the house destroyed or the jogger missing? Meet struggling alcoholic Rachel. She is angry, ashamed, and intimately knows the route and landscape of the train she takes every day. She’s carefully watched the houses and people along the rail line. After witnessing an act if infidelity from afar, the infuriated and bitter Rachel spends a night spent in a drunken haze only to find the next morning that the adulteress has mysteriously disappeared.With a damaging reputation that precedes her, emotional scars that have yet to heal, and a passion for justice, Rachel beings to untangle the truth of what really happened that night. Wrapped in lies, contempt, and unrequited lust, this brilliant thriller will captivate you till the last breathtaking page. "
1338,Stella Wenny,"This deserves all the freaking hype, indeed. Definitely looking forward to watching the movie in 2016.This is the kind of book that's so good it makes me envious, makes me wanting to be able to write a story like this. It started out a bit slow, but soon it's picking up pace and became so engaging I barely able to stop reading. All the characters are fucked-up people, I think that's one of the reasons why I love this. Though I find it quite distressing that almost all people are violent when they get angry. But I think that's because the author wanted the reader to suspect all people. Nobody can be trusted. Nobody is decent.The only thing why this doesn't go to my favourite shelf is because I don't really like the amount of violence and creepiness in this book."
1339,Simone,"I’m an early bird, and therefore I’m usually in bed by 9PM – sometimes earlier. The fact that was I was up until 11PM finishing the book should give you a pretty good indication of how into it I was!!It’s so satisfying to get your hands on a good book and being so immersed by the story that you devour it in just a few sittings (would have been one if I didn’t have to work!)The book had me on the edge of my seat, constantly wondering where it was going and what would happen next. It was gripping, enthralling and suspenseful; a great riveting thriller!!!"
1340,Erika,"Rachel Watson rides the train into London each day to get to work. Her train happens to stop across from one particular house almost every day, and Rachel has created imaginary identities, Jason and Jess, for the man and woman she sees frequently in their back garden. When Rachel hears the news about a missing woman named Megan, she soon realizes that Megan is her ""Jess"", and she becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to her.The story is told from three separate perspectives - Rachel, her ex-husband's new wife Anna, and the missing woman, Megan. Each woman knows only a part of the story, and we are left to piece it together as we go. This book kept me on the edge of my seat from the first page right up to the very end. It's full of terrible people, pitiful people, and broken people. Both Rachel and Megan had me wanting to alternately shake them, and then give them hugs to comfort them. I felt emotionally exhausted after finishing the book, but I didn't walk away empty-handed. There are several life lessons to be taken away at the end.1. Men are not to be trusted.2. People are not always what they seem.3. If he does it with you, he will do it to you.4. Women are not to be trusted.5. Alcohol can be your best friend and your worst enemy. Both at the same time.6. Therapy can help.7. Your memories are not to be trusted.8. Life is pain.9. People lie. (A lot.)10. If you do everything right, nothing can go wrong. (Wait, I think that was supposed to say everything can go wrong...)"
1341,Simona,"Rating: 5+/5Ce minunată este viața când reușești să dai peste o carte care să te prindă așa de bine între paginile ei!! Așa am pățit eu cu Fata din tren de Rachel Hawkins, o carte despre care auzisem atât de multe lucruri.Am observat că această carte este extrem de populară și mulți cititori o urăsc pentru acest simplu fapt, considerând că este o carte care prinde la publicul care ""citește o singură carte pe an"". Eu nu sunt de acord cu acest lucru având în vedere că foarte mulți cititori înrăiți au adorat această carte așa că mi se pare chiar o jignire când afirmi așa ceva. Da, părerile sunt împărțite dar este bine să nu arătăm cu degetul spre ceilalți cititori, mai ales spre cei care citesc des.Acțiunea acestei cărți m-a atras încă din primele capitole și am realizat că după aproximatix 100 de pagini aveam senzația că deja citisem mult mai mult decât o făcusem. Protagonista acestei cărți este o tipă pe nume Rachel, o alcoolică părăsită de soțul ei și rămasă fără slujbă. În fiecare zi ea ia același tren cu care merge la slujba ei inexistentă din Londra. În timpul călătoriei cu trenul aceasta de multe ori bea și analizează oamenii din jurul ei și părerea acestora despre ea, dar cel mai mult ea este interesată de o anumită casă pe care o vede din tren. În această casă locuiesc două personaje pe care ea le poreclește Jess și Jason iar acestea îi inspiră perfecțiunea de care ea nu mai are parte.Mi s-a părut extrem de interesantă cartea și a fost fain să poți urmări povestea din perspectiva mai multor personaje și în diverse perioade de timp. Principalele personaje feminine se pare că au o legătură între ele, legătură pe care nici nu o poți distinge decât după o analiză mai completă. Personajele nu sunt perfecte, relațiile dintre acestea de asemenea scârțâie foarte mult și fiecare personaj are ceva de ascuns din trecutul cu care nu se poate împăca.Rachel, pe cât de disperată de a participa la ceva interesant și de a încerca să rezolve o posibilă crimă, nu mi s-a părut în mod special un personaj lipsit de speranță. Are extrem de multe defecte, trăiește în trecutul care o bântuie zilnic, în amintirile pe care nu le poate vedea cu claritate, dar pe parcurs se vede că are parte de o evoluție, nelăsându-se intimidată ca în trecut.Toate personajele feminine au ceva în comun, trecând prin niște drame care le fac să clacheze la un moment dat. Întâlnim destulă violență în această carte în timp ce urmărim și drama unei alcoolice care nu își poate aminti momente din viața ei, momente ce vor fi definitorii pentru a realiza cine este ea cu adevărat și că vina nu îi aparține în totalitate.Nu mi-a plăcut de doamna detectiv Riley întrucât, la fel ca și Rachel, am urât-o pur și simplu încă din prima clipă. Este ciudat cum uneori un personaj nu îți poate plăcea chiar dinainte să știi ceva anume despre el. Detectivul Riley mi s-a părut că ar avea ceva personal cu Rachel și cred că și ea a simțit acest lucru. Nu știu dacă aceasta a fost doar senzația mea însă îmi pare rău că la acest capitol nu am reușit să aflu/disting mai multe detalii.Acest thriller m-a ținut cu sufletul la gură până la ultima pagină și mi-a demonstrat cum viața nu este perfectă iar de multe ori trebuie să ne alegem cu grijă oamenii din jurul nostru pentru că aceștia ne pot distruge la un moment dat dacă nu suntem îndeajuns de puternici.Dacă nu ați citit cartea până acum sper să o faceți cât mai curând pentru că este una dintre cele mai bune cărți pe care am citit-o în ultima perioadă!! Sper să mai pot găsi cărți așa de antrenante, care mă fac și pe mine să mă simt ca un detectiv în acțiune.Citate:
""Cum a putut Jess să facă una ca asta? Ce e cu ea? Uită-te la viața pe care o au împreună, cât e de frumoasă! N-am înțeles niciodată cum pot oamenii să nesocotească flagrant, cu asemenea ușurință, durerea pe care o pot provoca, urmându-și inima. Cine a zis că e bine să-ți urmezi inima? E egoism pur, un egoism care distruge totul."" (p.47)""N-a înțeles niciodată cum de era posibil să-ți fie dor de ceva ce n-ai avut niciodată, cum putea să te doară."" (p.107)""Astăzi, lumina e proastă, vremea s-a schimbat, cerul e de plumb, amenințător. Nu reușesc să văd în casă, nu-mi dau seama ce se întâmplă. Sunt de-a dreptul disperată. Nu suport să fiu lăsată pe dinafară - e bine sau e rău, acum sunt parte din povestea asta. Trebuie să știu ce se întâmplă."" (p.118)""Totuși, sentimentul acela familar de groază crește în momentul în care trenul oprește la semnal și aproape că mi-e frică să-mi ridic privirea. Fereastra e închisă, nu mai e nimic acolo. E liniște, e pace. Sau poate că totul a fost abandonat. Scaunul lui Megan e încă pe terasă, gol. E cald azi, dar eu nu mă pot opri din tremurat."" (p.288)""Plaja e pustie și e atât de frig, încât trebuie să-mi încordez maxilarele ca să nu-mi mai clănțăne dinții. Merg repede de-a lungul fâșiei de prundiș, dincolo de vestiare, atât de frumoase în lumina zilei, atât de sinistre acum, fiecare din ele, o posibilă ascunzătoare. Când vântul se întețește, cabinele prind viață, scândurile de lemn scârțâie, și, împreună cu vuietul mării, par a fi niște șoapte: cineva sau ceva se apropie."" (p.402)
"
1342,Susan Szafranski,Best book I read in a long time!!! 
1343,Iben ,Brilliant!
1344,Amy Quigley,Loved it! Couldn't put it down. 
1345,Nancy McFarlane,"When the main character is an admitted alcoholic and liar without much going for her I would normally not give the book much of a chance. But, Rachel’s fascination with making up stories about the couple who lived in a house she saw from her train window twice a day reminded me of Hitchcock’s Rear window and knowing how much I loved it I kept reading. And, boy am I glad I did. The Girl on the Train is a stunning novel of psychological suspense with a host of possibly unreliable witnesses. I couldn’t wait to find out if they were all lying, or if they were just fooling themselves about what they thought happened. For all of those readers waiting for the next Gone Girl I think this is it."
1346,Shelby Clark,"This was my first thriller/suspense novel and I could not put this book down. I really enjoyed the multiple perspectives and the importance of dates. Even though I am far from middle ages, divorced, depressed, or drunk, I found the main character, Rachel, very relatable. At some points in the book I loathed some of the characters but at other points I found myself feeling sorry for the same characters. I figured out the guilty person about halfway through the novel but it was still very interesting to find out how everything played out. As an American, I also loved that the book took place around London. The writing in this novel was very gripping. "
1347,Kaleb,"Great book!! Very exciting. The main character (Rachel) is a woman who is a depressed alcoholic because her ex-husband (Tom) left her for another woman (Anna). Rachel took the train every day to work, but after she got fired from her job she continued to take the train everyday to hide the fact from her roommate that she got fired. Every morning on the train, Rachel passes a certain couple (their names are Scott and Megan) living in an apartment by the train, and fantasizes about having the (seemingly) perfect life that this couple has. However, one day Rachel sees Megan kissing another man, and when Megan suddenly disappears, Rachel decides that she must get involved in finding out what happened to Megan. Rachel reaches out to Scott and they become friends, sort of...however, Tom and Anna happen to live near Megan and Scott, and so all their lives come to intersect in a beautiful mess. I think this book is very well-written because it definitely keeps you guessing about what happened to Megan. Some other minor characters are brought into the fray, but in the end you find out what really happened to Megan. There was a point in the book when it mentions a ""her"", but later on in the book you realize that the ""her"" is referring to a different woman than the one you expected.Wonderful book, would read again! "
1348,Shelly Cook,Really hard to figure out who committed the murder!! Lots of twists-I liked it!!
1349,Tom Cork,"This book is interesting reading on several levels. There's the plot level--who is responsible for the disappearance that occurs some 20% of the way into the book? Is it a disappearance? There's also some mystery with the narrators themselves. None of them is reliable, either by omission or because...well, no spoilers.The Girl on the Train is plot-driven, so my synopsis must be brief. An English woman is obsessed with her ex-husband and still dreams of the life they used to have before he left her. Every day, on the train to London, she passes by a house that stands next to where they used to live. She fantasizes about the people she sees in that backyard and invents lives for them. One day, she sees something from the train that shocks her, and the days and weeks that follow lead her (and the reader) to question everything she's seen before.Above all, the best thing about this book is how the male characters, who drive the action forward, are all in the background. The women in this novel seem to be acting as pawns, driven by their fascination with the perfect man, the perfect home, and the perfect suburban life. I wonder what each of these narrators would be without their obsession with status, control, and fulfillment gained through ""the ideal man."" Behind closed doors, none of these men is ideal, either, which we find out pretty early.Paula Hawkins has deep sympathy for these narrators, each of whom (especially Rachel) makes the reader cringe every time she makes questionable choices. But for what? Is society driving these women to lead desperate--even quietly desperate--lives? Are their goals unattainable?The choice of a train is fascinating, because--like these narrators' lives--the path of a train is fixed. There is the idea of movement, a destination, even a beautiful one, but no deviation is allowed.The final scene of this novel occurs near the beach in northern England, where the stormy gray sea is simultaneously colorless and tumultuous. At the risk of being sentimental--which is my habit--there is a strong parallel between the choppy water and these women, who are emotionally limited and moved by forces they cannot control.A terrific read."
1350,Laci Long,"This was a very engaging book. I liked the way the story was told from the POVs of the three main women in the story. There was great character development throughout and the concept of an outsider looking in, discovering the secrets of other people’s lives is fascinating. This book is compared to Gone Girl, which I think is BS. They aren’t similar and this book is fantastic on it’s own. I want to know what the next The Girl on the Train will be. "
1351,T.K. Roxborogh,"I actually listened to the audio book but am going to hunt for a paper back copy to own as well. I found this a compelling story - I'd heard about the unreliable narrator but, isn't that what we all are? Telling our view of the world through our own hurts, prejudices, fears and dreams? Because we are 'limited' to Rachel then Megan and then Anna's POV, the sleuthing has to happen between the lines and I loved the construction of this 'who dunnit.' The story was exceptionally well written and the characters completely F**ked up (as many people are) which made it at once difficult to like them but difficult to dismiss them.Ending great. High recommend."
1352,Peggy Parsons,"Everyone is messed up and acting very strange. Cheaters, liars, drunks, philanderers, killers, stalkers - this story has got it all. And yet they seem like normal people. Everyone is a suspect. You don't know who to trust. And, true to form, the lying continues to the very last page.Definitely kept my attention."
1353,Alicia Knight,Loved this book!!! I couldn't put it down!
1354,Sheri faulk,"Like The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo - you have to suffer through the 1st ""intro section"" - but without that, you have no background, no insight, no way for the Author to led you in your thought process by those context clues - that may or may not led you to proper thinking...Couldn't put it down after the bland section!Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning and every night. Every day she rattles over the same track junctions, flashes past the same stretch of cozy suburban homes. And every day she stops at the same signal and she sees the same couple, breakfasting on their roof deck, living the perfect life that Rachel craves for herself - a lifestyle she recently lost. She looks forward to observing this household every morning, even makes up names and narratives for its residents. Then one day Rachel sees someone new in their garden, and soon after, the woman who lived there disappears. Unable to keep this information to herself, Rachel offers what she knows to the police, and in the process is drawn into the lives of the couple she thought of as Jason and Jess but whose names - she has learned from the news - are really Megan and Scott Hipwell. But the police accuse Rachel of being unreliable, and it's true that her memories can't always be trusted. Plus there are the stories that her ex-husband's new wife has been spreading about her. By the time Megan's body is found, Rachel is in over her head, intricately entangled in the details of the investigation, as well as in the lives of everyone involved. Has she put others in danger? Has she done more harm than good? A compulsively readable, emotionally immersive, Hitchcockian thriller that draws comparisons to Gone Girl, The Silent Wife, or Before I Go to Sleep, this is an electrifying debut embraced by listeners across markets and categories."
1355,Maria Gonçalves,"The girl on the train foi o primeiro livro, em meses, que eu li sempre que tive 5 minutos para o fazer, a prova é que o li em 4 dias. A premissa do livro consiste na vida de Rachel e na forma como, quase involuntariamente, ela acaba envolvida em situações muito desagradáveis. Mal começamos a ler o livro percebemos que a vida da Rachel é recheada de pequenos mistérios que vão sendo desvendados ao longo do livro.Nos primeiros capítulos percebemos que ela vai para Londres todos os dias de comboio e na sua viagem passa sempre por um conjunto de casas que ela gosta de observar, especialmente uma delas, em que ela vê um casal para o qual inventa nomes e vidas. Tudo corre muito bem até Rachel assistir a algo que a perturba muito e acaba por se envolver numa situação que lhe trará muitos dissabores.Uma coisa que logo à partida achei fascinante é a questão da perspectiva da realidade que este livro traduz tão bem, as vezes achamos que as coisas são de uma certa maneira por nossa culpa ou porque alguém nos faz acreditar nisso, no entanto, muitas vezes na nossa vida, interpretamos coisas de uma forma errada porque criamos uma ilusão relativamente a algo. Nunca disse que esta review seria fácil de ler, mas se lerem o livro vão perceber perfeitamente.Depois amei o facto de que nunca estava a contar com os grandes twists da historia, claro que a autora faz de propósito, no entanto, acho fascinante como ela conseguiu dirigir tão bem uma historia com tanto suspense.Apetece-me “berrar” aqui uma serie de spoilers mas não o vou fazer porque quero que vocês leiam e amem e fiquem tão pasmados como eu. O poder que as pessoas podem exercer sobre outras chega a ser extraordinário.Em suma, este livro tem imenso suspense, boas personagens, bem descritas, é inteligente, é assustador e foi dos melhores livros (no sentido de entretenimento e não de qualidade) que li nos últimos tempos. Isto não é um livro de culto, no entanto, dentro do género de livro que é, ou seja, para entreter, é um excelente livro que cumpre na perfeição a sua função."
1356,Meghan,"One of the best books I've read this year. Rachel is unreliable and self-sabotaging, and the story is simply terrifying. A must-read for anyone traveling home for the holidays."
1357,Alex Cooper,"Really enjoyed this book, bought it this morning and finished in a matter of hours. I really enjoyed the writing style and the story was laid out so it was difficult to determine who was guilty, at some point I considered almost every character a viable suspect. Although at points one character began to annoy me with their actions this was I realized a part of the character, that character needed to be that way to be realistic and to make the book as good as it was. I would recommend this book and would definitely read another by this author. "
1358,Grace Dong,"I hated all the characters in this book, but that doesn't make this a bad book. In fact, it is a fantastic book, the character developments are REALLY good. All the characters are coming to life, and the book kept me guessing till the very last. The ending was a total mind fuck, I did not expect it AT ALL, it is just awesome. I know people are comparing it with Gone Girl, and many of them are hating The Girl On The Train, saying its nothing like Gone Girl. I never read Gone Girl before, so I can't really make a judgement between them. The only thing I can say is, this is a amazing book, maybe even one of my favourite."

1360,TL ,"4.5 stars... better than I expected. Books with alot of hype, it's 60/40 for me most of the time.. the 60% being I either: don't care for it and couldn't finish or I did finish it but couldn't see how it was so popular.This one fell into the latter 40%, for the most part. --The writing kept me interested, slowly weaving things together with the different POVs, and filling in the background and laying the groundwork for everyone. No one is a saint in this you find out, as different revelations and secrets come to the surface. Things you think you know or guess are up-ended later on and other leave you with a sense of dread and fascination. I found myself going back and forth a few times with different characters.Rachel is... difficult to sympathize with. Actually, while I liked parts of each narrator I didn't particularly care for any of them and yet I did care, if that makes sense. (The best way I can put it).Around 39% is when it became even more compelling for me. It was very hard to put down and I found myself going through my morning routine faster to get started on it.The twist I suspected near to when it happened, but it was a fleeting thought at first. I actually was thinking of someone else entirely before the the true perp showed their colors. It was surprising but also not a 'big twist' really (to me anyway). It was shocking and cold-blooded in the end but it also felt, ""been there done that"" in a way.The dread and uncertainty almost felt like it's own person at times, watching from the shadows.. ready to pounce when the moments where right.It was done very well don't get me wrong, I just wasn't as stunned as I should have been. Still, this was an excellent read and I would recommend it, just don't read too many reviews first ;-).Would I read again? Probably:) It's a good book to get lost in.Happy reading!"
1361,Jacki,"Did I just stay up all night reading? Sure did. AmI too creeped out to ever sleep again? Yup. Fans of Gone Girl, pick this up ASAP."
1362,Unauthorized Cinnamon McCann,"This just sucked me in and wouldn't let go! Rachel is a complete mess, and you can't help but shake your head at her decisions throughout, but even as I recognized all her self-deception and poor choices, I was rooting for her somehow. She has enough residual intelligence and grit that she remains sympathetic and compelling.Hawkins has woven a completely alluring mystery with the unreliable narration and the slow revelations of three different but connected women, all while managing to juggle a spliced timeline for maximum dramatic effect.I'll say no more - just go check it out!"

1364,Priyanka,What a page turner!! Has been so long since I read a book that I just didn't want to put down...forgot eating and sleeping for a week;) 
1365,Adeeb,"Absolutely phenomenal. Wow, just wow."
1366,Jenifer Filia,Could not put it down!!! Good read!
1367,Slc,Couldn't put it down!
1368,Karen Langford,One of the best suspense novels I have read. Felt like I was on the train!
1369,Rebecca,"I didn't think I would like this book very much at first, as it's a bit dreary in its tone, and the characters are not particularly likable as other reviewers have noted. But I soon found myself rooting for the main character anyway and - more importantly - I got hooked. I wanted to find out who the killer was, and everyone looked like a plausible suspect up until the end. The book was so well-constructed that this was one of the rare times I had to immediately go back and re-read some of the chapters. It is a bit reminiscent of the first half of Gone Girl when you don't know who is good or bad. In the end, a thoroughly absorbing read."
1370,Jack Goldman,"My wife recommended this book and she reads books at a much higher level than I do. So I was a little skeptical about this book and it started in the first person, a little intimidating. But after the second chapter I became drawn in by the three first person characters and above all the mystery.Since it's a story told by it's three main female characters you feel intimately involved with each of them.This is by far one my top 5 favorite mystery novels. I found myself unable to stop reading with the tension building to the final sentence leaving you feeling totally satiated and wondering how this author could possible top this work. "
1371,Lisbeth,"The Girl on the Train by Paula HawkinsThis is a book, I wanted to read for a long time, so, when finding it for a one week loan in the library in Karlskrona, I grabbed it. Ok, it is translated into Swedish, but still... I was a little bit nervous since it had got such raving reviews from almost everyone, and I was afraid that my expectations were too high. I did not have to worry. This book caught my attention right away, and I had difficulties putting it down and I finished it the same day.Rachel takes the commuter train from Ashbury to London every day. Having lived herself along the same railway line, she continues to keep an eye on the houses on her old street. She tries to ignore No. 25 since her ex-husband lives there with his new wife and their daughter. She still has not come to terms with the divorce and is harassing the couple with phone calls and e-mails. However, she has discovered a young couple at No. 15, of which she gets somewhat obsessed. She gives them the names Jess and Jason and imagine their happy lives, compared to her own miserable life. We slowly learn that the mixed gin and tonic Rachel drinks on the train on a Friday evening going home, is just the beginning of a trip into oblivion. Her drinking sprees make her wake up with very vague remembrances of what she has been doing. One day she reads in the paper that Jess (although her name is Megan) is missing. Two things come to her mind; the day she saw Megan kiss a stranger in the garden, which made Rachel quite upset with her at the time; and the vague memory that she was in the neighbourhood when Megan disappeared. She contacts the police to share her information, and gets questioned herself.It is impossible to tell more of the story without making spoilers, and this is too good to be spoiled. A psychological thriller at its very best. The story is told from the views of Rachel, Megan and Anna (the wife of the ex-husband), and evolves little by little. What you think you know, is not what it turns out to be.A fantastic, thrilling story which does not reveal the culprit until the very end. It is Paula Hawkins first book, which makes it even more admirable. The female characters, that make up the main part of the story, are very well drawn, and we are there and suffer with them. At least for Rachel, I felt like I wanted her to take a hold on her life and get back to the person she once was. Her problems were very well described, and you felt with her in all her misery.Dreamwork has bought the film rights and it seems that Tate Taylor will direct. Will be interesting to see who will play the parts of Rachel, Megan and Anna. Something to wait for as well as for another book by Paula Hawkins.From my blog thecontentreader.blogspot.com"
1372,Glenda Ricord,Great book. 
1373,Yvonne Morgan,"Was unsure of this book to start with....maybe it was because of all the hype it had received. but I am glad I decided to read it now...I found it easy to read, I loved the plot, the twist and turns ...and I could identify with the characters...it had me gripped ....The only thing I was a little upset with was the ending...I thought it was weak.....after all that intense drama to have an ending like that was slightly rubbish ....maybe the author just got fed up and run out of ideas ....but on the other hand with an ending like that there is room for a book 2.......maybe."
1374,Verge LeNoir,"Lots of moving parts to this book and it should be file under; suburban housewives with first world problems. I found the beginning a tad boring—I almost gave up on it, good thing I didn’t because I was rewarded with a good fun read.Three women narrate the story, Rachel, Megan and Anna.Let’s break it down a bit:Rachel is the sad pathetic drunk (She’s no Henry Chinaski but still, nothing makes a better unreliable narrator in fiction than a drunk.) she’s lonely, depress, jobless who still takes the train into ‘work’ because she has nothing better to do. A black-out drunk who’s miserable about her break up with Tom, a man who is now married and has a baby, she still calls him, and stalks his family; she’s all kinds of weird this one.Anna is the ‘bitch’ of the bunch who stole Tom from Rachel (yeah very soap-opera-ish) the mistress has now become the housewife with a rugrat. She lives in Rachel’s old house which she hates naturally; Rachel still bothers Tom which drives Anna crazy. Otherwise Anna is somewhat content with her little baby and a husband she loves dearly.Megan is the beautiful blond, who is a liar and a cheat, married to the perfect man. However she’s anxious, unhappy and wishes to run away from her life. She cheats on her husband, constantly lies about her past or where she’s been. Then she goes missing.This is the book’s big mystery.What happened to Megan? Who did what to whom? Clues are dropped and peppered all over these characters, at one point or another you’ll suspect this one, that one or the other. The touches of Hitchcockian psychological thrills, is what makes the book a page turner, hence the reason why this book has become Amazon’s bestseller of the year. Author Paula Hawkins knocked it out of the park with this one.I was left with one question though: Who’s the red-headed dude?"
1375,Diane Blodgett,"I was given two books to read. The Girl on the Train and another book. Two people told me to read the other book first because they liked it better than this one, so I did. I loved the other book. And then I started reading The Girl on the Train and I couldn't put it down! I liked the anonymity of Rachel (the main character) sitting on the train--the train she took everyday--looking out the window and imagining the life of a couple that she often saw on her journey on the train. I never would have dreamed of the story that author, Paula Hawkins, conjured up from such a simple act--sitting on a commuter train imagining a life of a couple one just happens to see while sitting on the train. What a compelling story!"
1376,Rendi Hahn,"Wow, this one kept me wondering until the very end! What happens when the last person to see a killer and his victim is so drunk that she can't remember what happened? Well, you'll have to read to find out. Told from the perspectives of the victim, the witness, and another woman, it highlights how painful and horrible alcoholism is, and how manipulators use brokenness in others to get what they want. The pace is different from your average thriller but a great mystery story nonetheless."
1377,Gem Routledge,"This has garnered many a comparison to Gone Girl, but personally I thought this was a whole lot better! Rachel is a great character, she's so real because she's so flawed and this makes her completely relatable. It's easy to see how she has ended up in the position she's in, an unemployed functioning alcoholic who resents her ex-husband for moving his new wife into her old house, and when she latches on to the mystery surrounding a missing girl, it provides her an opportunity to have something to focus on. There's so much to say about this book, yet I don't want to spoil anything as it's tightly plotted and each new revelation that comes to light throws more doubt upon what actually happened, and I loved that - it kept me guessing throughout, and even though I was adamant I knew who the baddie was (and I was right, woo!) I wasn't sure *how* it had happened... I know that's a bit vague, but suffice to say - read this now! You won't be sorry, and I'm looking forward to the film adaptation. "
1378,Kimberly,"This story had from the beginning. I loved the fast paced plot, along with the twists & turns provided.While some compare it to Gone Girl, I would not do the comparison. To be honest, I thought this book was better than Gone Girl. While I pretty much disliked every character in Gone Girl, I actually liked the characters in this book.The main character had flaws, which is a great thing to have in a story, as people in general have flaws; are not perfect. With those flaws, she was still a likable character. She didn't mean harm when she did stupid things but was acting from raw emotions. The new wife was a little less likable but still had good traits. I could go on and on regarding the characters but do not want to give anything away.While I figured out what happened to the woman that died, it took me awhile, which I greatly appreciate with any mystery/thriller. There were some awesome little twists and turns that kept my attention throughout. I seriously could never fully walk away from the story...and always wanted to keep reading it. Unfortunately, work or everyday life stuff would creep in at times. :(The approach that was taken, as far as how the main character got involved in the murder investigation was very creative. It is something that I have not seen before.I can't say enough good things about the book.Definitely recommend!"
1379,Tanvir Anwar,"A slow starter with an explosive finish!I was unlikely to pick this book up - but I really liked watching The Gone Girl (Gone Girl), and all promos for this book compared these two. An hour in, about 4-5 chapters down - I wasn't sure what I got into. The author seems keen on telling the story of a mopey divorced woman, with a little bit of whodunnit murder mystery wrapped around it. As the story progressed, the book picked up the pace and hit the right notes to tell a gripping story. Rachel Watson's protagonist is such a strong and interesting character, I really liked how Anna Watson grew into uncovering the big secret in the end. If possible, I'd have ranked this book 4.5 stars for not handling the fringe characters very well, and specially showing how dumb and clueless the detectives were all the time. I guess that is forgivable since the book is written as a POV narrative.Overall, a great read if you like thrillers."
1380,Chrissie Blankenship,Great book! Hated the ending!
1381,ReadandRated,"5 Stars from me!What a great debut thriller, The Girl On The Train is seven shades of awesome!I very quickly found myself drawn into the story and into feelings of empathy and support for 'the girl on the train'. What a mess she's made of things lately, bless her!I absolutely loved this book, loved the way things unravelled - mostly with me cringing as the poor girl seemed to dig herself deeper and deeper into embarrassing and unbelievable situations.This book is people watching to the nth degree with a heap of loneliness and desperation sprinkled on top of a classic crime thriller.A great read and a really fast read, almost impossible to put down as it flicks between characters meaning you have to keep reading in order to find out what happens next.Highly recommended."
1382,Erin Hecker,"I rarely read thrillers, but DANG, maybe I should read them more. I loved how the reader was left to piece the puzzle together. Once I hit the half-way mark, I was hooked. I literally could not. put. it. down. What a crazy ride. And an even crazier ending!"
1383,Kim Griffin,"A debut psychological thriller that will forever change the way you look at other people’s lives.Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning. Every day she rattles down the track, flashes past a stretch of cozy suburban homes, and stops at the signal that allows her to daily watch the same couple breakfasting on their deck. She’s even started to feel like she knows them. “Jess and Jason,” she calls them. Their life—as she sees it—is perfect. Not unlike the life she recently lost.And then she sees something shocking. It’s only a minute until the train moves on, but it’s enough. Now everything’s changed. Unable to keep it to herself, Rachel offers what she knows to the police, and becomes inextricably entwined in what happens next, as well as in the lives of everyone involved. Has she done more harm than good?Compulsively readable, The Girl on the Train is an emotionally immersive, Hitchcockian thriller and an electrifying debut. Oh wow, what an awesome book this was! I can’t believe it’s a debut novel! Not that I haven’t read good debut novels before, but this one really knocked my socks off. The novel alternates between the perspectives of three different women. I can’t say that the characters were all that likeable, but I’m pretty sure they weren’t supposed to be. I liked Rachel the most, but she frequently made me cringe with her embarrassingly bad decisions. I really felt more sorry for her than anything else, I guess. Megan was just incredibly messed up, and Anna…well, I pretty much couldn’t stand Anna. However, Hawkins seems to be a master at making you care about characters that are deeply flawed. In fact, maybe that’s a part of what made this book so interesting. The characters are so messed up, you can’t help but wonder what they will do next. It was akin to watching the Jerry Springer show or rubbernecking at an accident scene. Completely voyeuristic, but very enjoyable. I know most people aren’t going to believe me about this, but I saw the twist coming before the reveal. I think it’s only because I had insomnia one night and couldn’t help but think about the book. I can’t say what tipped me off because I don’t want to give anything away, but when you’re lying in bed for an hour or more, unable to sleep, there’s time to scrutinize a lot of things and some stuff just wasn’t adding up. That’s all I’m going to say about that. The writing was done very well, the plot moved quickly, and I didn’t notice any holes in it. I really just feel like this book was a literary masterpiece. I can’t gush about it enough. Obviously, I’m giving this one five stars. I’d give it a higher rating if I could. If you haven’t read this book, you really should as soon as possible. I listened to the audio book and I was really impressed, so I highly suggest reading/listening to it on audio. The narrators were amazing and they just brought it to life. 5 stars.This review was originally posted on Bookworm Book Reviews"
1384,Hannah,"wow! Elizabeth is missing, meets Gone Girl. enthralling, captivating and lovingly written. an amazing thriller that will win your heart"
1385,Virginia,"I finished it at 2 a.m. Need I say more? Probably not, but I will anyway. I haven't digested this yet (the 2 a.m. was eight hours ago). I'm better right now at why I didn't hate it. First, I don't know how the author did it, but I was not nearly as annoyed with Rachel as I normally am with self-destructive characters. Yes, a couple of times I thought, ""please, PLEASE do not pick up that drink,"" but it didn't prevent my enjoyment of the novel.Second, I see my Goodreads friend CLM thought it was predictable. I didn't find it predictable. Sometimes I'm onto things early, but other times (now, evidently) I'm a mystery/thriller writer's best reader - just dim enough to not figure things out. Third, the writing was not awful. In fact, I found it crisp and interesting. Fourth, I haven't figured out which of the loose ends weren't tied up, and what parts of the plot don't make sense. Maybe I will after I've had more than four and a half hours of continuous sleep, and perhaps I'll come knock off a star. But as of now, I think it was tied up ""all right and tight,"" as an old Brit might say.Fifth, somehow I didn't find it irredeemably dark. As with Rachel's character, I am not sure why not, when it's the sort of novel that would normally depress me. I would have to think about it or go back and read, but the author kept me sympathetic and interested without my getting too morose."
1386,Lucia,"OMFG! I can't believe I've finally read it! I wait so much time to have it in my bare hands!I litteraly wait months until it came to Uruguay and I finally bought it. This book kept me awake a whole nigth, Rachel is one of the best main characters Ive ever read of. She's an alcoholic unemployed person but she's clever and she always think the best of people even if she doesn't know them. She's always thinking about people and their actions. Her imagination is amazing, she invents a whole story to a couple she observe through the train window evri morning and evening, she named them, Jason and Jess, she invented to them jobs, age, how they met, everithig.So when she observed something strange one morning she realizes that Jason and Jess weren't than happy as she thought they were.She get's involved with a crime and different troubles with her ex husband.ITS REALLY AMAZING! THERE WAS MOMENTS I COULDN'T READ FAST ENOUGHHighly recommended!!!!!"
1387,Kim,Warning: this novel is addictive and will keep you up at night :-)
1388,Lisa Chemberlin,"This was a super fun read. Dark and twisted. Just when you think you have it figured out, you find out you didn't. Quick read because you can't put it down. I've heard people make comparisons to Gone Girl. I hated Gone Girl and loved this story!"
1389,Tanya Argibay garcia,"I picked this book up at a store a few weeks before I actually bought it, but I only read a few pages. I put the book back thinking it was a sad story about a woman obsessed and fixated on her past. The depression seemed too much for actual enjoyment. I'm so happy that I gave this book a second chance. Don't give up after a few pages like I initially did. Stay with this girl on the train. You will not regret the ride!"
1390,Kathie,"I always like a good, juicy, unreliable narrator. Or two."
1391,Aisling Van Dam LaBauve,"I could hardly put this book down once I started to read it. I wanted to know what happened next. As another reader noted, the story is fairly sad from beginning to end, and none of the characters are extremely likable, though by the end I felt a little better about Rachel. The unsavory characters just added to the bleak tone of the book, at any rate; it wasn't a bad element, in my opinion. I tore through this book in three days.*Having just read a rather biting review of this book that states this book is for people who don't read, I would add that I am an avid reader of all sorts of books. I am also a writer. We all have our own opinions; this review is merely mine. "
1392,Ellen Guerin,"Okay, so others may not think this should get five stars, but I listened to it rather than read it and the suspense probably added to my running speed, because I became so involved with the plot. The actress who reads this is very believable as the main character - a great choice of reader. I found the protagonist's lack of self-control believable and sympathetic. Also, I did not guess the ending for most of the book, which is a big plus in mysteries. "
1393,Cathryn Conroy,"This is dark. And it's depressing. And it's really creepy. The characters all have almost unfathomable problems that make your heart break. But once you start reading Paula Hawkins's ""The Girl on the Train,"" all you will want to do is read. This chilling book--combination psychological thriller and who-done-it--tells the story of three women and two men living in the London suburbs and the love, lies and jealousies that break them. Each chapter is told from the first-person point of view of one of the women. The writing is riveting and the plot compelling, and even when you guess ""who done it,"" there are more twists and turns to come. Advice: Take it to the beach or save it for a snow day when you can just give in and read for hours at a time. It's THAT good."
1394,Bebete,Loved all the twisted characters. The book kept me interested. I really enjoyed it! 
1395,Bobbi Woods,"Oh my goodness this book was so juicy. Of course it fits my ""perfect book"" characteristics--takes place in Great Britain, suspenseful, well-written. I listened to this book and the narrators (3) lulled me into a auditory bliss. I also know a book is good when I don't just listen on my commute in the car but make excuses to go for a walk or listen while I cook dinner. The reason I chose this book is that I heard a review that this novel was the next ""Gone Girl."" I seem to be getting through my audio books much faster than my print books these days.The story takes place in the suburbs of London. A sad, lonely, alcoholic woman--Rachel--who rides the train every day, passes her old home and fantasizes about her old life (husband left her for Anna and they live in the house she once shared with her ex, Tom) and about the life of a couple she does not know, but fantasizes about, a few doors down. She even gives them names--""Jess"" and ""Jason."" One morning, Rachel sees ""Jess"" do something awful from her vantage point on the train and then finds out that she is missing. Rachel becomes entwined in the mystery and things get VERY interesting and suspenseful. Some might say this would be an easy mystery to figure out. Now that I look back on it, I can see how. However, I usually don't try to figure out mysteries when I am reading them. I just enjoy the ride.... I found the character development to be outstanding--I had such a clear vision of each one in my mind. Having been jilted in a marriage once myself, I could see why Rachel felt the way she did and how she went down such slippery slope.This book is really worth reading if you enjoyed any of Gillian Flynn's books--it's similar in some ways, yet very unique in others. Definitely not quite as dark or ""disturbing,"" though. "
1396,Janet,"What a page turner, no wonder this is the #1 NY Times Bestseller. This quick read is told from a few perspectives and goes back and forth over a period of time. The main narrator is unreliable, since she is a heavy drinker and imagines lives for people she sees from the train she takes daily. Really fun, I couldn't put it down!"
1397,ines.literarias,"THIS BOOK IS JUST AMAZING! I gave it 5 stars because it became one of my favourite books, its perfect! Full of suspense and totally unexpected. I trully recommend itAND I WANT TO READ MORE OF THIS TYPE OF BOOKS + I WANT TO READ MORE FROM THIS AMAZING AUTHOR! :)"
1398,Aline,"Wow. This book was really, really good. A very quick read, very compelling characters, and I'm a sucker for the 'plot unravels in the present while we see the build up in the past as well' type narrative. The climax of the story is incredibly tense and gripping, I was literally biting my pen I was so anxious and exited.If you want a quick read with a strong, uncomplicated and pleasant writing style, very well structured narrative, interesting flawed characters, a great first-person-present-tense with a likable voice and a gripping mystery, I recommend this. "
1399,Marcie Weatherby,Could not put it down! 
1400,Marybeth,"WOW! Fast paced, very entertaining. Twisted. I loved it!!!"
1401,Jonna,"Hitchcockian is right--Paula Hawkins debut novel is worth the time. It was not at all what I'd expected, and that alone kept me reading. At the halfway mark I found myself saying ""This book has me all screwed up! And I cannot put it down!"" I had to find out why, and who. Now, be warned: there are a couple of spoilers in this review, although I do not give the end away (I'm not that kind of person!).Told primarily by Rachel, who isn't always a reliable narrator, we see how these people's lives are intertwined. Rachel may be crazy, you think. The others who tell their sides (Anna and Megan) may be as well. A bit of the literary criticism that was pounded into my head in college popped up as I read this, so I will share it with you, even though I normally just read a story for the story. Rachel rides the train every day, back & forth to a job she no longer has, looking out the window at the house she lived in with her ex-husband, who now lives there with his new wife & baby. She's got a drinking problem, and has become a bit obsessed with the couple who live in the house a few doors down from her old house--the couple she calls Jess & Jason. Rachel is, in the beginning of the book, on a journey to nowhere. As her story unfolds, and she gets involved in things outside the train windows, we see that she is finally moving forward. The train is a symbol of her journey. This novel has been compared to Gone Girl, and a couple of other things I've not read, but the comparison to Hitchcock is spot on. Read it. You'll like it. Oh, and another thing--I had not figured out who or why by the time it was revealed, and that, as you may know is always a plus in any mystery for me! "
1402,Alison Taylor,"Train ride or train wreck?For me, this is a new genre of mystery/thrillers, along the lines of Gone Girl. I like it. The characters are well developed, although I never did really understand what Megan's problem was. Was she bipolar? Narcissistic? In any case Rachel certainly was a tragedy, but in the end she redeemed herself, which I applaud. Like a train, this book chugged steadily along gathering speed at times and screeching to a stop at others. I couldn't put it down. There was just too much to discover and the desire to find out what happens next, undeniable. "
1403,Cornelia,"Friday July 5, 2013 In my head I can still see that little pile of clothes lying at the edge of the track, abandoned. That’s one of Rachel’s observations from the train as she rides pass the neighborhood she use to live in before her husband cheated on her and then married his mistress. Her life’s gone downhill ever since. That’s how the story begins. Written in first person form three differ women. The girl on the train, Rachel, her husband’s new wife, Anna, and a dead woman recently found dead, who lived in the same neighborhood, Megan. Their lives are connected .. more so than we first realize. More so than they realize. I don’t want to give anything away but everyone sees things differently while riding on a train, and in our own lives —in our relationships with our spouses or lovers. Sometimes seeing things differently …not seeing people as they really are …can be dangerous. You might find out what a person is really like …to late to save yourself. Or you might figure them out just in time to save yourself. Toward the end I guessed who did it but I couldn’t guess what happened next. The Girl On the Train is charged full of electrifying suspense. It’s wonderfully written with a twist at every turn. I consider it a must read. It’s that good."
1404,Gabriella,"Great psychological thriller, I couldn't put it down! If I were to compare it to gone girl, I still like gone girl more, but this one is great if your in the mood for something similar. I figured out what happened around page 228, which for a book that's around 300 pages, isnt so bad. I didn't expect it for most of the book. Great read. "
1405,Emily Cullen,"Rachel has become so fascinated with the couple whose house she passes while she's on the commuter train that she's even named them. She often sees them nuzzling on the terrace and compares it to her life, to her recent divorce (her old house is just a few doors away from their's) and alcoholism. One day Rachel sees ""Jess"" kissing someone else and soon after the woman goes missing. Rachel has information for the police but they deem her unreliable as she has suffered a blackout the day the woman disappears. As Rachel tries to piece together what happened that night, she gets deeper into the dangerous mystery. The excitement never stops with this thrilling mystery and the ending is great. Highly recommended!"
1406,Andrea De santis,"I didn't know about the book or the author, I went to the book shop and I just bought it judging the book from the cover. I have to say I really enjoyed it, wonderful story and very well detailed...recommend it "
1407,Nurlely,"A very well executed book! I read the Indonesian version which I was not that eager to read at the beginning.... I lost my interest after 5 pages but decided to move on. I am excited that I did that.Rachel is a drunks. She started it long before her marriage is over. It was not that bad before, from her point of view but got worse when her pregnancy program failed. Her marriage is over for Tom could not handle her drinking habits and what came after that. He cheated their marriage when he met Anna. Rachel then moved from the house and Anna lived there, with Tom and their baby girl, in a house next to the railroad.Pretending to still have her job (she was fired because she was drunk at work and made her company lost some money), Rachel went to work every morning and back late in the afternoon in the same train. She always looked at the houses near the railroad, especially ones closed to her old house. -----------------What would you do when you arrived at home filthy and blood on you but did not remember a thing?Rachel went on with her life despite the terrible wound on her head because she did not remember a thing from last night, the same night Megan, a beautiful wife who lived closed to her old house, was found dead."
1408,Robin Stevens,Stunningly creepy and compelling domestic thriller. A scary reminder that you never do know what's going on in the lives of your nearest and dearest - although these people's secrets really are above and beyond most (I hope...). The book twists and turns all the way to an ending that left me gasping. Really top-notch stuff.
1409,Gail Lindenberg,"This book kept me guessing.At first I thought the girl in the train was a spirit, haunting her former life from the tracks and keeping her regular routine in tact. instead, the several perspectives of the characters showed that she was real. The pieces came together at the end with satisfying closure to a tawdry tale of sadness underlining the ease with which a person can use and abuse another human for selfish needs. Ann Landers used to write that one can not be taken advantage of without giving permission. sometimes it takes strength to recognize another's absolute disregard for anyone else."
1410,Karla,I can't wait to watch the movie!! Loved it
1411,Dolores,Fascinating and creepy!! Loved it.
1412,Sarah Jasmon,"Better than Gone Girl.Do I need to expand on that? OK then...This was the sort of book that had me brushing the kids off and forgetting to feed them because I couldn't bear to put it down. That doesn't really make me a bad mother, though. I finished it in an afternoon. I really couldn't put it down.Every day on her commute to London, Rachel looks out for the same house, to see what the inhabitants are up to. She doesn't know them, but has given them names and back stories, and craves the daily update she imagines for them as the train makes its regular halt at the signals at the end of their garden. But Rachel isn't really going to work every day, and she's got more history involved in her mystery couple than she lets on. The story is told from three perspectives, those of Rachel herself, Megan - the woman in the house - and Anna, who lives a few doors away, and is the new wife (once mistress) of Rachel's ex-husband. Then Megan disappears, and Rachel can't stop herself from becoming involved.It wasn't just the plot that kept me reading, excellent though that was. Hawkins does not put a foot wrong, whether it's in the changing voices, the atmosphere and setting, or the characters themselves, main or subsidiary. There are no slips, no careless moments to jerk the reader out of the complete suspension of disbelief that is the hallmark of a really good read.The only minor quibble relates to reading it on my Nook. I didn't realise until a good few chapters in that the dates weren't moving day by day, so I lost track a bit of when the 'Megan' chapters were happening. It's just not as easy to flip back and check electronically."
1413,Sherry Mitchell,Loved it! Can't wait for the movie. Spellbinding and I loved the English setting. Thanks mom and dad!
1414,'Manda,"My Rating: 5/5This is Paula Hawkin's first novel. It debuted on January 13, 2015 and is, as of this post (two weeks later), No. 2 on USA TODAY's Best-Selling Books list.Synopsis“Maybe it was then. Maybe that was the moment when things started to go wrong, the moment when I imagined us no longer a couple, but a family; and after that, once I had that picture in my head, just the two of us could never be enough.”Through several different points of view and many twists and turns, The Girl on the Train encompasses a sinister plot, a deadly romance, and the darkness in a seemingly peaceful domestic life. Rachel, one of the main characters, is an obese, twenty-eight-year-old who has been divorced for two years, yet still dreams of the married life she left behind. On her lonely train ride home each day, she passes a young couple, upon whom she paints an imaginary life of domestic bliss. But one evening, she sees something from the train window that sets her on a tangled and distraught path. She goes to the police with her story and becomes wrapped up in an investigation. But will she do more harm than good?My Likes:“It gives me a little frisson even now, walking past that house - butterflies suddenly swarm in my stomach, and a smile comes to my lips and colour to my cheeks.”Writing Style: Hawkins’ writing style is the best part of this book! It was very readable while also being complex enough to keep me entertained. As soon as I started reading it, I couldn’t put it down. It demanded to be read, compelled me to keep going, sentence after sentence, until I found myself at the end. Yet still the novel was nicely paced and didn’t seem rushed despite the continual forward movement.Character: The characters in this novel were both real and relatable. Every character had a depth of personality and wasn’t merely two-dimensional. Not only that, the characters were so real that they left an impression and gave me insight into my own character. The imagination and precision that went into the characters in this novel was astounding. (If the characters in my still-in-the-works novel turned out half as good as these, I would be beyond happy.)“At night when I lie awake I can hear it, quiet but unrelenting, undeniable: a whisper in my head, Slip away.”Suspense: I appreciated the ability of the author to create such a tangle of suspicion that it left me completely in doubt as to who the true criminal was. (Although, I - typically, unless the novel is completely simple and sub-par - tend to go along with the narrator in her quest for knowledge. This allows me to be just as surprised as she is, though it takes out the fun of pretending to be the detective.) But in this particular novel, I was able to do both - though there are probably those more skilled or paranoid than I am who figured out the culprit. But I can gladly say that I was both surprised and intrigued by the ending.Everyday Life: I like that this book took something incredibly simple and every-day (a train ride home from the city) and used it to incorporate a complicated and sinister plot.The author goes into some detail about ordinary life: the people Rachel seems from the train in their domestic environments. And it’s touched on in such a way that it makes me feel as though, by not paying attention on my bus ride home, I’m missing something tangible in life. I might miss an entire story by just reading a book or surfing through Facebook instead of staring out the window at the houses and people that pass by.My Dislikes“It's not until I get home that I realize I cut my hand when I fell, and at some point I must have rubbed my hand across my mouth. My lips are smeared with blood.”Character Differences: Rachel and “Jess” do have some similar personality traits, vices, and expectations, yet they are also fundamentally different people, with different needs, values, and complications. Yet the two different points of view often seemed too similar in thought (and writing style) that, if I hadn’t had the name at the beginning of the chapter to go by, I wouldn’t have known which character was which. [ For instance, Rachel is incredibly needy and obsessive throughout the novel. “Jess” on the other hand, seems to be more aloof and independent, but seems to slip into a neediness that mirrors Rachel’s, without reason. ]“It's a dream, I think. I keep trying to grasp at it, to hold on to it, but the harder I struggle, the fainter and the further away it gets.”Introduction to ""Jess"" and ""Jason"": I felt as though the beginning introduction to Jess and Jason wasn’t quite long enough for me to feel as acutely that sense of loss that Rachel experiences at the end of the novel, when her entire world has fallen over onto itself. I felt her disappointment, but I couldn’t quite share it with her.WarningsThis book has very mature themes and some graphic content, including both sexual and violent.All in all, few dislikes! I adored this novel. I started reading it late into the evening, and literally could not put it down until I had finished it (which ended up being some four or five hours later in the early hours of the morning). I feel no shame! Haha, but seriously, this book (as most, if not all, of the previous book reviews have certainly mentioned) is definitely worth your time. (Trust me, you won’t need much time on this one. It’s a fast and thrilling read.) I was locked into the character’s lives as resolutely as if they had been my close friends.I hope you enjoy the book, and I'd love to hear your thoughts on it if/when you read it! Check out this review and many others at my blog: CreasedPage.May your life have many creased pages,‘Manda"
1415,Beatriz,"I was originally going to rate this 4 stars due to some minor plot discrepancies, but my enjoyment while I read this was so great I can overlook minor flaws. Many people hate the 3 female protagonists in this book, I personally really enjoyed them all. Yeah, they're flawed, they have personal problems and struggles but they aren't perfect cookie cutter women which I so appreciate. They are each strong in their own right and stick to their convictions. As a mystery/thriller novice I didn't see the twist or big reveal coming and was very taken aback which I enjoyed. The story starts off rather slowly, but once you get over the 50 page hump you start to see where Hawkins is going with this book. My only (minor) gripe is that there are two characters who play a rather large role in the first 3/4 of the book, yet they are abandoned for the last quarter and their stories are not wrapped up. Other than that this was an excellent read and I totally understand why the wait list at my library system currently stands at 371! "
1416,Andreea Teodora ,"Really enjoyed this read! Similar to ""Gone Girl,"" as it keeps you wanting to read just to find out what really happened! I would highly recommend this book if you enjoyed ""Gone Girl."""
1417,Kathy,I really enjoyed this book. It reminded me a lot of Gone Girl. Well written with prose that flows easily.
1418,Brett Schreiner,"The language is probably at the low end of four stars- it's good but not great. The language is probably the least well crafted part of this book. But it's not all about the language, is it?No, this one has so much more going for it than that. There are the characters- told by three distinct women, each challenged by some very real character flaws and compelling pasts that are meted out, ever so perfectly throughout the novel. Nothing is revealed to soon, nor is it held out to the very end for the sudden ""twist"" ending. Then there is the pacing- wonderfully done, each page doling out its own revelations of character and plot. And the plot? Nothing that is groundbreaking, but it's pretty flawlessly. This is a mystery, and could you guess the whodunnit in advance of the reveal? Sure, you could. But like the greatest of mysteries, this one gives you all the information you need to start piecing it all together, and pretty bluntly, but it is never so heavy-handed as to set off the lightbulb that makes you go ""well, gee, that's obvious.""This novel has suffered some comparisons to Gone Girl (and I say ""suffered"" because I view that one extremely unfavorably- it's final twist is indeed shocking, but only because it's completely ludicrous and unfairly achieved), and I can see where some of the comparisons arise from. The domestic arrangements are horrifyingly caustic, which is usually something I hate. I still read for the escape, see, and while I love conflict and struggle I want it to take place outside of the home. In Girl on The Train, I just didn't mind the emotional setting. It was too compelling, and the characters, far from being shallow and conniving (minus the one baddie who, as a murderer, needed to be conniving), were fully realized and their admirable attributes balanced realistically with their shameful ones.The other comparison this draws is to Rear Window. While that is deserved due to the framework of main character, Rachel, as voyeur, this novel quickly departs from the small window view and thrusts our heroine into the action. So if you're fearful of encountering something detached from the action, fear not. There is plenty of movement and activity here.In all, I would highly recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys mysteries. And also to anyone who enjoys character studies or domestic dramas or to anyone who just enjoys watching a complex drama come together piece by piece."
1419,Meredith Jaeger,"If I've given other books five stars, this one deserves ten. Despite the comparisons to Gone Girl, I would say The Girl on the Train more closely mirrors Big Little Lies by Liane Moriarty (one of my favorite books). What set this book apart for me was the pace. Instead of waiting for the action, I was hooked from very early on, 16% in on my Kindle. Paula Hawkins does an expert job of keeping the reader riveted while casting suspicion on every character, making it impossible to know who to trust. Atmospheric, creepy, fast-paced, beautifully written. It will be hard to find another book to top this one!"
1420,J.T.,Loved it - great twisty who done it.
1421,Lena ( book-junkie),Excellent book! I couldn't put the book down. I read it in three days! A must read!
1422,Blake Goldstein,"What a great story! Crazy people, alcohol, forgotten memories, vengeful exes & trains. This book keeps you constantly guessing and on edge with suspense. Definitely recommend to anyone who loves drama spiced with a little bit of thrill! "
1423,Peta Campbell,A great read with a 'you can't really tell who did it' ending. 
1424,Jo,"Absolutely loved this book. Exciting debut novel and congratulations to Paula Hawkins. Three women each tell the story from their viewpoint and intertwine as the book goes on. We meet Rachel, Anna and Megan. I really liked the way my opinion of each character changed as the book went on. An intriguing plot line and suspense mostly generated by Rachel's story and her lack of memory about events. Megan goes missing and Rachel feels she knows the answers if only she could remember. Some people have commented that the ending is easy to guess- I don't think so and anyway why would you? There are only so many characters in the book so it stands to reason you'll know the character and the law of averages says someone will be right and there are only so many plots for an author to use. Instead, let the book take you on its journey and discover the delights of all being revealed at the end. This book is a cracker; well thought out plot and with interesting, well rounded characters. Buy it; read it and enjoy the ride"
1425,Linda Koch,Riveting!
1426,Janee,"Great book, I couldn't put it down. The characters are all so different, I honesty didn't even know who to feel sorry for. Definitely an enjoyable read for readers who like twists and turns in their stories ! "
1427,LibraryReads,"“Rachel is a washed-up thirty-something who creates a fantasy about the seemingly perfect couple she sees during her daily train ride into London. When the woman goes missing, Rachel manages to insert herself into the investigation of the woman’s disappearance. In the vein of Gone Girl, this dark psychological thriller is fast-paced and features some very unreliable narrators.”Andrea Larson, Cook Memorial Public Library, Libertyville, IL"
1428,Michelle,"This definitely scratched my Gone Girl itch. Very suspenseful. All 3 of these women are falling apart in the most reviling ways. I liked exploring and finding sympathy for them, connecting and finding similarities with myself or real women I know. I like that the author didn't look away when things got ugly and let you in on the characters most selfish and self destructive thoughts and choices. I don't know that I've read women in popular fiction that were so unlikable but sympathetic. Felt very real, feminist, modern. Loved it."
1429,Willian Godoy,"Let me just start by saying ""wow"". If you intend to start reading this book, make sure that you do so while you have nothing to do because you won't be able to put it down. You become so engulfed in the mystery that your mind keeps going through different theories that just make you want to read more. The writing is splendid and I love that you read through the point of view of the three girls. Each story is crazy on its own and it's mind blowing when they tie together at the end. You start guessing at the solution early on, but you'll never be sure and you might even be wrong at the end. I love that you grow to love Rachel despite also criticizing her for what she's doing. At some point in the book I stopped feeling bad for her because but then I realized the girl is traumatized. If I was in her shoes I would be too. If you liked Gone Girl you will love this book! Read it!"
1430,Linda Appelbaum,"Now I understand why is was something like #295 on the waiting list at the library! I decided to just buy it (Kindle) rather than wait. What a completely engrossing, satisfying story! The tale is told by 3 women - Rachel, Anna, Megan and involves a sad, lonely, heartbroken alcoholic woman (Rachel) who creates an entire fantasy life surrounding a couple she sees daily from the train window. It is only 4 doors down from her old house, now occupied by her ex-husband and new wife (Anna). Megan is the character about whom Rachel fanaticizes and watches each day with her handsome, loving husband - the perfect couple, perfect life. Megan goes missing and things begin to really fall apart for Rachel who deals with her alcoholism and frequent blackouts, unemployment and her life full of lies and misery. She plops herself squarely in the middle of the mystery of the missing woman and it is fascinating how the story unfolds, each chapter revealing another juicy tidbit. I read it quickly, but wanted to savor every morsel of it at the same time. This I could read again. "
1431,Donna Marie,Great book. Kept me interested from the beginning. Each chapter revealed a different piece to the puzzle!
1432,Christine Churchill,Excellent read!!!!! A real page turner.... In fact there were times I was afraid to turn the page!!! 
1433,Adi Gupte,"I was gifted this book on my birthday and I took me a while to start but this is one one those books that grows on you. I finished it in a couple of days and have concluded that Paula sure has some talent for writing a thriller.The dark places of her mind, alcoholism and a human urge to get better of the situation, Rachael's struggle to make sense in her miserable life and her entangled affair with Jess and Jason and their supposed 'perfect' relationship sounded mundane to me at first, but Paula's mesmerizing writing builds depth to the characters who you can relate to as real world people, their faults seem reasonable and every character has a role to play.Loved it and would recommend it to every fellow reader. "
1434,Tara Young,"Ah, Ms. Hawkins….very clever. Ingenious, really. The tale of two women (at first), each told a year apart. I felt like I was traveling on the train. First with one, on a fast ride with destination and the other a slower ride, but still another destination that had already been foreshadowed. Yes, I did figure it out before the end, and have to admit there was a little too much of the therapists role. Could have been off-putting if more were shared so kudos for keeping the balance. this was not an easy book to write so my hats off to you there. Compelling, intriguing and yes, I couldn't put it down. the best part was right up to the end it was suspenseful. Another hats off right there. Ah yes, the way the cork screwed, plot twisted, women and their revenge or assurances or whatever you want to label it as being. I think I'll label it survival."
1435,Crystal,Audio readers (there are 3) were awesome! Great book!
1436,Denika Fox,24 hours from start to finish....I couldn't put it down. Loved it but I'm a sucker for a short chartered quick read with a crazy plot. 
1437,Leilah Skelton,"This is such a fantastically gripping thriller; it’s quite amazing to find that it is a debut. I loved the concept of where a fleeting commuter glance could lead. (The speed-blurred cover text is genius, by the way). The timeline cleverly switches back and forth between the events leading up to the crime, and Rachel’s embroilment in its aftermath, and it kept me rapt, guessing wildly, until the very end. Yes, there are strong, shadowy strangers, long-hidden grudges, fake niceties, unguarded flashes of malevolence… all the usual suspects a good thriller has to offer. But it is Rachel, our ‘Girl on the Train’, who is the most fascinating. What we know for sure is that she’s close to emotional collapse and alcohol-dependent. She can’t trust herself, and so neither can the reader. Is she the architect of her own unhappiness? Is she a victim, or a perpetrator? A fantasist? A voyeur? Is she strong, or is she weak? You’ll commit to finding these answers, I guarantee it. ‘The Girl on the Train’ is one hell of a ride, and once on board, there’s no stopping ‘til terminus. Enjoy your journey. I did!"
1438,Kelly (TheWellReadRedhead),4.5 stars if I had the option.http://www.thewellreadredhead.com/201...
1439,Tamara Lane,Wow! I couldn't put this one down!
1440,Janice,"The Girl on the Train is an up-all-night, cannot-put-down thriller! The unreliable protagonist is named Rachel, a seeming sad sack alcoholic who is divorced and very unhappy. She rides the train daily into and out of London to her mindless job in public relations. While on the train, she passes the houses and fantasizes about the perfect lives lived within the walls. She is stuck on one in particular house and even names the loving couple Jess and Jason. One day, she sees Jess kissing someone on her terrace and Rachel is crushed to see that it's not Jason. She soon learns that ""Jess"" is, in fact, named Megan and she has disappeared. The police suspect the husband Scott, who Rachel secretly thinks of as Jason. Rachel soon loses her job over her alcoholism, but keeps up her schedule of riding the same trains back and forth to London to hide the embarrassing truth from her roommate and to stay connected to her drama of Megan and Scott. Rachel decides that she must insert herself into the drama of the missing wife because she feels that the information that she has from viewing that kiss from the passing train in critical in saving the husband. The other piece that we learn is that Rachel's ex-husband, and his new wife and child live a few houses down from Megan and Scott and that this house was originally Rachel's. All of the lives become intertwined in interesting ways and suspicion shifts around constantly because the reader is never sure about the veracity of what anyone is saying, intentionally or unintentionally. Rachel, who blacks out when she is drunk, is constantly trying to piece together the ongoing story and trying to decipher reality from her imagination. It is a very exciting book and reminded me of the Hitchcock movie ""Rear Window""."
1441,Catherine McKenzie,I raced through this book and thought it was well written and well-executed.
1442,Ellen Dunne,"Loved this book. Its deceptively simple style drags you right in, making you want to read on and on. While I cannot say that I was very surprised by the ""whodunnit"" in the end, it still was very cleverly done, with main protagonist Rachael being a very unreliable narrator. Despite her alcoholism and all the flaws that come with it, I liked her, and also the Co-protagonists Megan and Anna. They all had something you could sympathize with, even if you didn't find them sympathetic, exactly. I personally love stories that are set in an environment that could be my own life, rather than serial killer scenarios. So this book is definitely up my alley and I can recommend it for a fast, feverish and engaging read. "
1443,Jen D. Sandidge,Would read the VERY NEXT THING this author wrote. Compelling read. Fast and twisty plot. Loved it.
1444,Paulette Folmer,"At first, I wasn't interested in reading this book. I read a review of it, and thought, that sounds pretty good, maybe I'll try it. Boy am I glad I did! This was an amazingly twisted story of a murder, told from the viewpoint of several different characters, with abusive relationships, alcoholism, and survival instinct all playing a role in the outcome. You really have to pay attention to the title of each chapter, as it tells you who is speaking and, more importantly, when. When the pieces start to fall into place, you can't put the book down because you want to find out how it ends - and what an ending it has! If you like psychological suspense and plot twists, this book is for you."
1445,Yesse,"You would be setting yourself up for disappointment if you actually believed that everyone you passed along the street lived a life full of laughter & happiness. Fact is, there are many people out there that are miserable, sad, grieving, addicts & reckless. This book is exactly that. Rachel is a young woman, an alcoholic actually, that cannot get over the fact that her husband Tom has left her for another woman, Anna. She’s had to move to a neighboring city & takes the train to & from work every day, or at least that’s what her roommate thinks. The truth is that Rachel hasn’t only lost her marriage but also her job, since she doesn’t know how to tell her roommate she just pretends she’s still employed & makes that commute every day. Normally she begins to drink in the evenings, but sometimes she can’t deal with her inner demons & starts drinking her gin & tonics during her early commute. On those days she gets so plastered she blacks out & barely has any recollection of what has happened. This proves to be a huge problem. Rachel has made it a habit to stare out of the train window during her commute & every day she sees this couple in the yard of their home. She gives them names & imagines what their lives must be like because she always sees them in good spirits. However, one morning she sees something completely different & it ruins the story she’s made up in her head about this couple. Not being able to understand what has happened, she is pulled into their lives & unfortunately cannot pull herself away due to her own weird fascination for wanting to find out what’s really going on.This twisted, dark, psychological thriller completely consumed me. I found myself reading at red lights, during my breaks at work ... any small window of time that permitted a few pages I took advantage of. I love how the story is told from different POV’s & I also really like how it goes back & forth in time. To me these things specifically make the read go so much faster. If you’re looking for a page-turner & you like suspense I definitely recommend this read. Paula Hawkins absolutely delivered."
1446,Shannon McCrimmon,The twists and turns. This is storytelling at its best. I highly recommend!
1447,Saskya ,"That was a totally engrossing story! I like these kind of books, not necessarily of the crime/mystery genre, where there are clues throughout the story, key words that the reader can pick up either early on or in retrospect, that give the culprit away. It feels like a scavenger hunt, or a playful wink from the author. I managed to pick up in those clues and identify the murderer.Paula Hawkins tried very hard to throw me off, and it almost worked, but I was adamant. The story unfolds in a diary format sort-of, of three women :Rachel, the main protagonist, who numbs the pain of a bad marriage and failed dreams with alcohol, Anna the other woman, the new wife, and Megan, Anna's neighbor who goes missing. It is only fitting that the story is told from the point of view of these women. Telling you exactly why would give too much away. So each characters get their turn to narrate 2-3 days of the present time (although Anna is not introduced in the beginning). There is no big leap from a period to the next; only Megan's ""diary"" is set from a year earlier, but get back to the present time as the story goes. This book has been compared to Gone girl. But in reality what both books have in common is the genre. "
1448,Aggeliki,An excellent read. One of those rare books that had me thinking about them during the day and being anxious to get back to them in the evening.
1449,Beth Simmons,Listened to this on Audible. Good audio read for sure! 
1450,Emily Friedman,This is definitely the best book I've ever read. I never wanted to put it down. 
1451,Lou Robinson,"Thought I'd like this book, it ticked all the boxes: based in London suburbia, crime fiction, not too long. And yep, sure did. Not that the characters are that loveable, in fact pretty loathsome really. But really liked the writing style and pacing,in fact struggled to put it down. It'll make a good film."
1452,Sarah Miers,"I didn't expect to spend such a huge chunk of the weekend reading this but I truly could not set it down. A lot of people are comparing it to ""Gone Girl,"" and I suppose there are some similarities, but Hawkins takes the idea of an unreliable narrator much further and also perfectly describes a woman foundering on the rocks of alcoholism and depression. You really have to pay attention to the timeline switches but the plot unfolds so well. I really enjoyed this one but it hurt my heart as well, all three of the women whose stories are told are in places in their lives where the past is dragging them backwards."
1453,Evan Geller,"IntenseIntense as an electric arc, a difficult but well drawn story. Honest and deeply pathetic. A heavy sigh upon ending. "
1454,Alyce Tordsen,It is a real thriller. Hard to put down.
1455,SUSAN OWEN GLASER,"I DID AN ' ALL-NIGHTER' ON THIS ONE! TERRIFIC. THIS AUTHOR MADE ME FEEL ANTICIPATION ON EVER PAGE TO THE POINT I DID NOT PUT IT DOWN TILL I HAD FINISHED READING IT. A COMMUTER TRAIN AND 3 LIVES.THAT'S IT. BUT, WOW, CAN THE AUTHOR, PAULA HAWKINS, WRITE. I LISTENED TO A STORY ON NPR ABOUT IT AND BOUGHT IT IMMEDIATELY. I HAD NEVER HEARD OF HER. I THINK, FROM NPR, PROBABLY NOT TO MANY OTHERS HAD EITHER UNTIL THE TRAIN CAME ALONG...OH, BY THE WAY, IF ONE HAS BEEN READING CHIT-CHAT ON REVIEWS REGARDING COMPARISONS, I READ 'GONE GIRL', AND I HATED IT..."
1456,Shellie Kennedy,"I really enjoyed this book. At first I was going to rate it 4 stars because I could not get over my frustration at the main character's alcoholism. Just stop drinking! I kept screaming it at the book and her persistence was infuriating, but after I finished the book I realized that Rachel's drinking is a key piece of the story and that all those bad things had to happen before she quit. This book definitely kept me on my toes. I must admit I guess about halfway through who the bad guy was but I still wasn't disappointed to find that I was right. The author gave an interesting perspective of three very crucial female characters. I love that it was through their eyes and not their male counterparts. Women can be vicious but at the same time incredibly resilient. I found myself being angry at all three women several times but just as they grew to understand one another (at least Rachel and Anna did) I also began to understand them a little more and I gained patience towards them. Overall, I thought the storyline was unique, the characters vivid, and the circumstances real enough to be believable and outlandish enough to keep the reading suspenseful."
1457,Mieke Tanghe,Echt een boek dat je niet aan de kant kan leggen!
1458,Alison Kemper,"About twenty pages into this novel I thought, oh damn, another unreliable narrator. I kept reading because Rachel is such a compelling, realistic character. (I'm a fan of ""unlikable"" characters--I find them interesting.) Parts of the plot weren't too hard to unravel, but I had to keep reading (at a breakneck speed) to find out what happened to Rachel. Great suspense, great settings, great characters, great read."
1459,Terri,"I read this in two days. Simply couldn't put it down! Very well written from the first page. Rachel was an engrossing character. Damaged and broken and because of her unreliability in what was real or unreal, due to her drinking, she was the perfect character for this plot. This novel was so well written and took this reader along for an enjoyable ride with all the twists and turns. The writing wasn't overly descriptive but certainly enough that I felt like ""I"" was sitting on that train right next to Rachel.Personally, I thought it was way better than Gone Girl........I loved Gone Girl ALL the way through until the ending when I shook my head and said, what?! Not so with this story. Realistic and satisfying ending that doesn't leave the reader shaking their head in confusion. My only concern is now finding another book to keep me as engrossed as this one did. I highly recommend it!"
1460,Nadezda Kolokolova,This was very exciting! For the last 40 pages or so I couldn`t put it down! Highly recommend!
1461,Tiffany Scherer,"I loved this creepy, uncomfortable book all the way through. My skin was crawling in many parts in the best way possible. These characters are all so well-developed, and the plot is incredibly twisted and thick with thrills. It's a good Gone Girl-esque psychological thriller, maybe a little faster paced but just as readable. The narrator was so unreliable, but I did start rooting for her! I could relate to her desperation in some ways. In fact, I think I could relate to all of these characters in one way or another, despite the fact that I didn't really like many of them.... I couldn't put this book down until I knew who done it, and it was a satisfying finish. 5 stars. "
1462,Brenda Kittelty,"A compelling psychological thriller, set up so that every main character was under deep suspicion at some stage. Really clever without a hint of smugness, a cracking good read."
1463,Sonia Kantak,"Despite many of the most recent comments, I genuinely enjoyed this book from start to finish. It is really hard to weave an engaging thriller/mystery story and until now, I was beginning to give up on the genre. The Girl on the Train read like a story told on Dateline, but I still would recommend it. Admittedly, there are some truly trying personas to get on board with, but I felt they were just believable enough to be possible. We all know that one compulsive liar or that one person obsessed with the drama of other's lives. The ending, though anticlimactic to some and maybe even expected, was quite honestly pretty fitting for the tale. After reading through a suspenseful thriller most any ""happy"" ending will seem to fall flat. If you understand that this mystery is meant to be solved, then there are high hopes for you to enjoy the book. "
1464,Marce Granados,"Intrigante, rápido, confuso, engañador, agobiante, claustrofóbico y tremendamente adictivo. Tome este libro sin mayores expectativas, sus primeras 50 páginas no me conducían a ningún lado, pero de un momento a otro el libro tomó vida, cogió forma y no me soltó! En sus últimas 100 páginas mi corazón estaba a reventar, latía tan fuerte como el de la misma Rachel, debo confesar que me tomó por sorpresa... (no, no lo vi venir) cosa que me gusto demasiado porque yo tenía un/una candidato/a diferente al del final, así que quede como ""ohhhh"". La historia me gusto muchísimo. Muy, pero muy buen libro."
1465,Belinda,"Every morning, Rachel gets up and catches the 8.04 commuter train from Ashbury to London. Every day, about halfway through the journey it stops at a signal in Witney, sometimes for a few seconds, sometimes for a few minutes. While sitting their waiting, Rachel can see into the houses that back onto the line. She watches the people inside, having breakfast, getting ready to leave and she imagines lives for them, assigning them them names and careers. Her favourites are Jess and Jason. Jess, a beautiful blonde, Rachel has decided works in the fashion industry and is an artist. Her handsome husband Jason is a doctor, whose frequent absences Rachel attributes to a doctor who specialises in foreign aid. Jess and Jason are very much in love and remind Rachel of her true love, Tom, and the blissfully happy times they spent together. In the evening, Rachel takes the 17.56 home and she checks in on the Witney residents. These events structure her day and, I suspect, her life. The interest Rachel has in Witney is intense. Her day is structured around those two stops and her surveillance is constant and odd. While reading, I started to ask myself why does she care so much; why is she so invested in other people's lives? As we start learn more about Rachel, we find out she was happy and now she is not. Something happened, something big, that resulted in her happy loving marriage ending and Racel lodging with a university friend Cathy, a woman she describes as ""a nice person, in a forceful sort of way She makes you notice her niceness. Her niceness is writ large, it is her defining quality and she needs it acknowledged, often, daily almost, which can be tiring."" Something bad has happened for Rachel to be in the place where she is, and the spectre of this bad thing hangs over the opening chapters of this novel, building tension and setting up Rachel as one of my favourite literary figures - the unreliable narrator.One morning, Rachel is shocked to see Jess kissing another man, betraying Jason, who Rachel has decided is the perfect husband. The next day, she is shocked to see Jess's face plastered all over the news. Her name is actually Megan she has gone missing. Her husband is not Jason but Scott, who works in IT and is prime suspect number one. Rachel is convinced he is innocent and has decided she must tell him and the police that Rachel was unfaithful, but can she leave the isolated half-life she's been living in order to do this? Is she able to take the step from being the girl on the train to being involved in a real-life missing person's case?I really enjoyed this book. The tension at the centre of the tale is established early and effectively and grows steadily throughout the book as the story is told by different characters, including Megan. Comparisons have been made between The Girl on the Train and Gone Girl. They are both tense psychological thrillers but they are different in that The Girl on the Train is less dark than Gone Girl and the characters will be much less polarising. I think if you liked Gone Girl you will probably like this but also the audience for The Girl on the Train will find the book less polarising.A cracking read that I finished in an afternoon. Five stars."
1466,Ali Carey Billedeaux,Woah. Brilliantly deceptive. I do have a soft spot for the unreliable narrator. This might be better than Gone Girl.
1467,Douglas Wickard,Review to come. Reese ... when will the movie hit the theaters?
1468,Randy Tramp,"Girl on a Train by Paula HawkinsPG13 for language and sexual situationsThe Book: Rachel considers herself worthless and turns to the bottle. She loses her job but continues to ride the commuter train twice a day to trick her landlady. She passes the home of her ex-husband Tom and his new wife Anna.Because of a signal malfunction she often finds her trail stopped on the tracks next to her former home. She notices another couple. She refers to them as Jess and Jason and manufactures a narrative about their lives.When Megan (real name of Jess) disappears Rachel finds herself in the police investigation. She was stalking the neighborhood the night of the disappearance. Because she drinks to a point where she has blackouts she has only sketchy memory of the night and unexplained wounds on her body. The book is in three first person voices: Rachel, Megan and Anna.My Thoughts: I know why this book has been on the New York’s Best Selling list for the past few months. It’s good and easy to follow with the different dates and times at each section. This is a raw look at the world of alcohol and human carnage. There were surprises all the way until the end. This book has a powerful messages.The take-away:People lie to themselves and others. (Value Truth)Men and women expect different things out of a relationship. (Value Insight)Sex outside marriage damages relationships. (Value Marriage)"
1469,Jordyn Redwood,"Told in the same vein as Gone Girl with alternating points of view. The author does a great job of keeping you guessing as to who perpetuated the ultimate crime and it doesn't help when the main character drinks to the point of blacking out and is stalking her now remarried ex-husband because she can't emotionally let him go. And then, a woman pops up dead on the same street he lives on, and she's been there, but can't remember. Even has a night where she comes home injured-- but can't remember. Really enjoyed this novel. Highly recommended. Will definitely read the next book by this author. "
1470,Sarah Brocious,Review to come
1471,Erin Heyman,LOVED this book! could not put it down. and stayed up way too late a few nights reading it.
1472,Arlene,"I would actually give this a 4.5 if that were an option. The only down side to this book is that I knew I was being manipulated, but the writing was so good that I didn't mind. Shades of Gone Girl."
1473,Annie,"Very well done debut novel by Paula Hawkins. She does an excellent job of portraying the disease of alcoholism and how it ravages the main character as she tries to cope and remember the things she saw. She tries to figure out the mystery but no one will trust her or believe her - she is considered an ""unreliable witness"" because of her alcoholism. But she is a strong character - very well developed. This book does have a Hitchcockian feel to it too and clues are doled out in each chapter. The book switches narrators with each chapter so you can follow the story from different viewpoints. Each character is well written and has a different personality in how the book is written. I liked the book very much."
1474,Elise,"This one really kept me on the edge of my seat. I love the way Hawkins gradually reveals key information along the way while at the same time brilliantly developing her characters. The writing was good too--stark, taut, clear, and sometimes beautiful. During the busiest time of the season for me, I finished reading this one in only three days because it was that good. I couldn't put it down. The Girl on the Train was everything Flynn's Gone Girl should have been."
1475,Leona,"WOW!!!! Absolutely mesmerizing. It was hard to put down. I highly, highly recommend to anyone looking for a fast paced mystery/thriller. "
1476,korey,"This book is so creepy, make your skin crawl good. Goes on my Must Read shelf."
1477,Marimirl,"Ich habe das Buch im englischen Original gelesen, daher kann ich nichts zur deutschen Übersetzung sagen. Nachdem das Buch momentan ja in aller Munde ist, musste ich selbst herausfinden, was hinter diesem Hype steckt. Der Klappentext klang vielversprechend, auch wenn ich mir noch nicht sicher war, was mich erwarten wird, aber das finde ich auch gut so! Nach Beendigung der Leseprobe war sofort klar, dass ich das Buch auf der Stelle weiterlesen muss. Stilistisch hat mir das Buch sehr gut gefallen. Obwohl es sich um einen Thriller handelt, meiner Meinung nach ein sehr guter Psychothriller, versprühte die Erzählweise eine gewisse Ruhe. Für mich stand dies für die Ruhe oder Stille, die Rachel im Zug empfand, vielleicht aber auch für ihre Einsamkeit. Ich könnte sehr gut nachempfinden, wie sie sich fühlt, was sie denkt, was in ihr vorgeht. Meiner Meinung nach wurde sie als Charakter sehr gut dargestellt. Die anderen Charakter kennt man nicht so gut kennen wie Rachel, aber das fand ich auch in Ordnung und hat zur Geschichte gepasst. Das einzige, was mich etwas gestört hat, ist dass das Buch im letzten Drittel für mich etwas langatmig wurde. Ich habe das Buch gerne gelesen, es hat mir sehr gut gefallen, aber es war nicht schwer, es auch mal für ein paar Tage aus der Hand zu legen. Das Ende war für mich schon überraschend. Ich habe sehr lange etwas ganz anderes vermutet. Erst relativ kurz vor dem Ende habe ich langsam geahnt, was hier tatsächlich passiert ist. Ich habe das Buch sehr gerne gelesen. Es handelt sich um einen Psychothriller, der jedenfalls Einblick in die Psyche von Rachel gibt. Abgesehen von einigen Längen hat mir das Buch sehr gut gefallen. "
1478,Dana,"I could not put this book down! Written in the style of Gone Girl, but with the page-turning suspense of The Husband's Secret, this book kept me captivated for two straight days. I couldn't get anything done while reading this book! The character development and insight into their demons was phenomenal. Although most of the characters were hard to love , I couldn't prevent myself from becoming wrapped up in their lives. I had figured out the ending before it came, but the plot took me through many twists and turns up to that point."
1479,Erin Ennis,"I may be one of the few people out there who absolutely hated ""Gone Girl"". Between the slow paced start to the completely unreliable narrators, I just could not sink myself into that best seller. So I was cautious to buy this...and boy was I wrong.""The Girl on the Train"" was everything I had heard, and hoped, ""Gone Girl"" would be. Thrilling. Captivating. Twisty. Creepy. Brilliant writing surrounding an even better story. The fact that the narrator can't remember things (not really a spoiler at all, she has a pretty apparent drinking problem from page 1) gives it that edge of mystery without forcing the narrator to lie to you, which is fantastic. I loved the changing viewpoints between the characters. I loved that the three viewpoints you got were ALL female and all slightly damaged in some way. No Mary Sue characters in this setting; each woman is hiding something bitter and cold and terrible about their persona (alcoholism, cheaters, liars, immorality, etc). The twist felt REAL, not contrived. You spend the entire read trying to figure out ""whodunnit"", making ""The Girl on the Train"" a fantastic page turner.The one other thing that really got me: I ride the train everyday. Between people walking by outside and people on the train, you can't help but find yourself staring. Watching. Contemplating. Who is that person? What is there life like? That's the EXACT question this asks: it takes such a human response and makes you LIVE it."
1480,Ali-Jae Asselstine,"Of course it's not 5 stars in the same way To Kill a Mockingbird, Catcher in the Rye, or One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest are 5 stars, but it's 5 stars alongside its peers: Gone Girl, Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, and other contemporary thrillers. I had a blast reading it. "
1481,Neil,"The 5* rating is more as a testament to the engaging force of this book. I found myself eager to read, even just little snippets of the unfolding story. By no means a perfect book, but pure escapism.... It did make me want to drink constantly! "
1482,Abbey Pierce,Unexpected turnI couldn't put it down and the ending was incredible. This must be a definite addition to your reading list.
1483,Barbara Matteau,"This book was a fast paced thriller that I couldn't put down. Yes thoughts of Gone Girl flittered through my head as I read the book but I liked this one so much better. The pace is sharp & dynamic. It does go from one characters perspective to another which I often think is cheating even if I enjoy it but the different views into the other characters does help the layering of the story. Rachel, the main character, is depressed & an alcoholic prone to blackouts from drinking binges. She takes the train to work each day & catches glimpses of other, seemingly better lives, in apartments the train passes by. She hears of a murder of one of the occupants, someone she thought seemed to lead an idyllic life & decides to get involved in the mystery. Of course this is crazy to do & it gets her into all sorts of trouble bit it was an engaging & satisfying read."
1484,Ярослава,"Everybody and their mom have read this book; now I, too, have joined the crowd, and loved it.God, such excellent uses of so many day-to-day paranoias! Do our memories, and our perception of ourselves match what others see and remember of us? (Lemme tell you, reading this book messed with my social anxiety big time, but the plot was so engrossing that I kept reading anyways; but yeah, trigger warning for those of us with social anxiety). How do we navigate our perception of the others, and how do we judge them clearly when they are feeding us the stories that mass culture assiduously teaches us to expect (and when we are happy, moreover, to impose such narratives on them)? Then, with the alienation of the urbanites, you are often expected to get glimpses of other people's lives, but not much by way of significant interaction; how is one supposed to react when something one sees demands an immediate reaction? (but then, how much info *can* a fleeting glimpse yield?) Etc., etc.All in all, seriously addictive, A+ usage of unreliable narrators, great collage of the creepy and the mundane. Recommended. God, I didn't expect to love it as much as I did.The one minor thing is, I'm still not sold on the idea of Anna's POV. The juxtaposition of Rachel's and Megan's POVs was neat, because they are pretty much polar opposites in terms of the sources of their discontents (cannot say more without spoiling several major plot points), whereas Anna isn't, and, moreover, is much closer to a stereotypical cackling villain than any other character. I don't think one can, or is supposed to even, to feel any sympathy for her, which marks her out against all other characters."
1485,John McKenna,"Mysterious Book Report No. 175by John Dwaine McKennaWe’ve just returned from the annual Mountains and Plains Booksellers Association Trade Show in Denver, Colorado. It’s a yearly affair with 70 or 80 publishers, several hundred bookstore owners, their employees and managers. It features thousands of new books, authors, lectures and seminars about what’s hot, what’s not, trends in the bookstore retailing arena and the current state of the publishing industry in general. It’s always an exciting, educational and exhausting, non-stop three day affair. On display from publishers large and small were the new books for the fall and holiday seasons in every imaginable category from anthologies to zoology. In our area of interest—crime fiction, thrillers and mysteries—two books were standouts, gathering special attention from everyone. We’ll review one this week and the second one next week.The Girl on the train, (Riverhead Books/Penguin Group (USA) LLC, $26.95, 325 pages, ISBN 978-1-59463-366-9) by Paula Hawkins is due for release on 15 January 2015, and the movie rights have already been purchased by DreamWorks Studios. It’s getting an extensive national marketing campaign and will be one of the most talked about books in the coming year. Why? Because it’s one of the most psychologically thrilling and intense murder mysteries you will ever in your life read. Alfred Hitchcock is probably turning over in his grave with envy because he won’t get to film this one . . .In it, a woman named Rachael takes a train into London every morning of the work week. Each day, it’s the same train, at the same time, she sits in the same seat, and the train stops at the exact same time and place—day after day. The sheer boredom of it is mind-numbing and soul-searing. So much so, that Rachael makes up an imaginary life and name for a woman she spots drinking coffee on the balcony of her house, which is one of a row of houses near the tracks where the train stops day after day. Most times Rachael sees a man with the woman and she imagines a life for the pair of them. Then, one morning Rachael sees a different man on the balcony, engaged in a passionate kiss with the woman. A few days later the woman, whose real name is Megan, has disappeared without a trace. Rachael’s imagination runs wild with possibilities . . . then a neighbor named Anna enters the narrative . . . and from her perspective it’s revealed that Rachael is an unreliable witness, one who has a hard time distinguishing between reality and fantasy, who may in fact be dangerous. The rest of the novel unfolds like an onion, one layer at a time, as it’s told in first-person narratives by Rachael, Anna and Megan. Each chapter, and almost every page, ratchets up the tension as it reveals some exciting, surprising new element to the plot until everyone is the potential killer, and the real murderer lurks in plain sight, right in their midst as Rachael tries to sort out which of her memories are real and which are imaginary. The Girl on the Train will keep you guessing right up to the end and so engrossed in it’s pages that you won’t know if there’s a train wreck in your own front yard! It lives up to its potential in every way, and is one of the most outstanding debut novels in a long, long time. You’ll be sorry if you miss it.The Girl on the TrianLike the review?

1486,Laurie Hanan,"This was a great ride! The unique concept of the plot pulled me in, the growing tangle of events kept me turning pages. The narrative moves between three women whose voices are so similar, I sometimes confused who was speaking and had to go back and check. None of them were particularly likeable or easy to identify with. The timeline jumps around. But all in all it wasn’t that hard to follow and the action was intriguing. This is good, solid storytelling and I enjoyed every minute. Couldn’t stop reading till I got to the end. "
1487,Priscilla,"Wow!!!!!!! A suspenseful thriller with lots of twists in the plot. Narrated by three women, one a drunk, one a liar, and one a cheater. Who do you believe? Who do you root for? This book makes you think twice about what you may casually observe of other people's lives when you're out and about or at home with your blinds open or sitting on your porch. The Girl on the Train is an intense psychological thriller that's difficult to put down. "
1488,Happycrafter207,"Everyone in this book is absolutely horrible, and as a result I couldnt stop reading it to see what terrible things they would do next. It's also a well-written,psychological thriller, with a couple of different narrator with added great point of view. I think it's also interesting that the central character, Rachel, challenges readers to think about how much we assume, pre-judge about other people based on our limited knowledge of them. I will see what else the author has to offer for sure."
1489,Sidney,Whoa! Just as good as what all the other reviews are saying! Psychological thriller like Gone Girl and has all the makings to be a blockbuster film. Started it last night; got up this morning and couldn't put it down until the last page was read.
1490,Aldana,"ACTUALIZACIÓN 24/12/2015 Si hay algo que me olvidé de comentar es que el libro, mi edición, venía con faltas de ortografía, ""errores de dedo"" y demás, que lo único que hacía era entorpecer mi lectura. FIN DE LA ACTUALIZACIÓN.OPINIÓN INICIAL: OH POR DIOS Qué final!Las primeras páginas fueron de lo más aburrido, no avanzaba más. Iba todo increíblemente lento, hasta la página 250. Ahí fue cuando todo se puso realmente interesante, sin contar las últimas 50, que fueron lo mejor. Me tuvo tan enganchada que hasta dejé a mi novio colgado en whatsapp.No me esperaba que termine así, están todos realmente enfermos y locos. Aunque a muchos les caiga mal Rachel, a mi no. Creo que hasta en un punto llegué a entenderla. Lo único que no me cuadra es que después de dos años siga enganchada con un tipo que no le da ni la hora."
1491,Meredith Allard,"I LOVED this book. I've been reading a lot of historical fiction lately, which is my favorite genre, but I felt I needed a little something different. I had heard a lot of great things about this novel, so I decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I did. This is the first novel in a long time I couldn't wait to get back to and I finished it in two days. It's a fast read, but in a good way. The chapters fly by and I found myself saying the old ""Just one more chapter tonight...just one more chapter...""I figured out whodunit less than halfway through, but that didn't stop my enjoyment of the rest of novel. I liked seeing how the main narrator, Rachel, figured out the mystery of who murdered the young woman Megan. I thought Rachel was a very realistic character, faults and all, and I believe a lot of people can relate to the way she idealized strangers she sees out of a train window. Many of us think the grass is always greener on the other side. I thought the lesson Rachel learns at the end, that things, even the things we're closest to, are not always what they seem, is an important one we all need to learn. I will definitely be seeking out more novels from Paula Hawkins. "
1492,Kathleen Crowell,loved it! Rachel was so raw it was almost painful to read each time she took a drink. very well done!
1493,Laurel-Rain,"Riding the train morning and evening, Rachel imagines the lives of those she sees through the windows. Those living in the houses facing the tracks. She has a special attachment to one young couple she calls Jason and Jess...and imagines the perfect life they share. And down the street from their home is where Tom and Rachel once lived, and where he now lives with his new wife Anna and their baby. Can anything feel more painful?Rachel's life is a disaster area...a broken marriage, and a husband who cheated on her. She is an alcoholic and her husband reminded her often enough that she was to blame for everything. Her blackouts make it hard for her to counter his view of their life together.Narrated by Rachel, Megan (Jess), and Anna, we begin to see that nothing is as it seems. The timeline for the stories takes us back and forth, from Rachel in the present to Megan in the past, with the story slowly moving forward to a significant date: the day Megan went missing.This is the part where I must leave off describing the events, as those who read it must discover the truths on their own, just as I did. Some might say that all of our narrators were ""unreliable,"" but some partial truths were hidden beneath all the stories, and it was impossible for me not to have a favorite narrator. One I believed more than the others.""The Girl on the Train: A Novel"" was a riveting thriller that kept me glued to the pages until the very end, reminding me once again that life (and fiction) can throw many curves. 5.0 stars."
1494,Doreen Dickinson,wonderful! first book I have read in a long time I had trouble putting down. sad it's over.
1495,Marcela Gómez,"Para ser honesta, esta es una de las pocas novelas que me ha motivado últimamente. Definitivamente no era para nada lo que esperaba. Paula Hawkings entrega un thriller bastante interesante y con giros totalmente inesperados. Hay quienes lo aman, otros no tanto, en especial por la forma en la que está escrito pero para mí ello le añadió mucha más profundidad a la historia. Parte de las personas que han hecho comentarios dicen que el problema que ven es que cada uno de los personajes es un desastre... desde cierta perspectiva es así, pero hay que preguntarles a estas personas quién no lo es, todos tenemos errores, cosas buenas, malas, etc., por el contrario si la protagonista fuera buena y fuerte, perfecta, se tendría que cuestionar su fallido matrimonio, y lo mismo ocurre con el resto de los personajes. No entiendo cómo hay personas que esperan que los personajes de las novela sean equilibrados, bonitos y perfectos en muchos sentidos, cuando en realidad los seres humanos estamos llenos de defectos y en ocasiones no conocemos los problemas y fallos de los que se encuentran a nuestro alrededor. "
1496,Victoria,"I really liked this book. I see that some reviewers didn't like it and thought it was a rather lame mystery. I, on the other hand, thought it was a gripping and suspenseful psychological thriller. I couldn't put it down. Yes, the characters weren't necessarily likeable as people, but they were sympathetic, and I wasn't sure 'who done it' until the end. I thought the author was pretty good at making me wonder about several of the different characters at various points in the book. I can't tell what else I thought was so good without giving anything away, so suffice it to say I recommend the book to anyone looking for a good, quick read mystery."
1497,Rebecca Fox,"Great readI really enjoyed this book, although it took a while to get into. Once you are in, though, you will want to keep reading."
1498,Nagi Colella,"Cuando un libro no revela demasiado de sí mismo en la contratapa o, aunque sea, en alguna de las solapas, o es un completo éxito o un tremendo desastre. ""La chica del tren"" encaja a la perfección en el primer grupo. Es un libro que los atrapará ni bien comiencen a leerlo, y tanto será que no podrán soltarlo. Así que comiencen su lectura con esta advertencia.Yo no lo había visto en la librería, me enteré de esta obra por una noticia en un sito de la web en el que se anunciaba que ya se habían vendido los derechos para hacerlo película (con Emily Blunt como posible actriz principal). En la nota se mencionaba que era un libro que había reventado las ventas en Estados Unidos, y a partir de allí, comencé a indagar acerca de él.Todos los comentarios que leía acerca de la novela eran positivos, y todos mencionaban el hecho de la adicción a sus páginas. En mi caso, lo terminé de leer en un día y medio. La lectura es ágil, interesante y engañosa, que hace que prestes atención a cada detalle, porque no sabes bien qué es cierto y qué no.La obra gira en torno de tres personajes: Rachel, Megan y Anna. Está narrado en primera persona con capítulos que se intercalan y te van contando de a poco la historia para que en tu cabeza puedas ir armando el puzzle. La chica del tren es Rachel, una mujer con un pasado complicado que ha derivado en su problema con el alcohol y con las terribles consecuencias de éste, como tener lagunas mentales y no recordar en absoluto lo que hizo en un momento en particular. Su vida es un pena, por ello, cada día cuando toma en tren (tanto a la mañana como a la tarde) para ir a su lugar de trabajo, se imagina la vida perfecta de una pareja que habita en una casa donde siempre su tren se detiene ante la señal de un semáforo. A estas dos personas le inventa nombres, Jess y Jason, actividades, profesiones y demás. Hasta que un día ve algo extraño y a partir de allí, se dedica a resolver este misterio.La historia está narrada de tal forma que no te deja soltarla, porque a cada paso quieres saber por qué suceden las cosas que pasan. ¿Por qué Rachel es así? ¿Y qué papeles juegan Megan y Anna en esta historia? Si tienen dudas acerca de comprarlo, sáquenselas porque es hiper recomendable, atrapante y adictivo. ¡No se lo pueden perder!"
1499,Jacquelyn,What just happened? The book started of a little slow for me and the timeline of the story was a bit confusing at first but after awhile things really took off. I am sure I am not the first to admit that people watching can be entertaining. Watching strangers you've never met & making up stories about their lives can always be good fun. Who knew it could turn out to be so dangerous too!! This book introduced the reader to 3 very different and very troubled & somewhat horrible (although not always completely their fault) women. We got a brief glimpse into their lives & we got to see how the coped with the struggles life threw at them. This book is a great example of showing how messy life can be. What may seem perfect on the outside may actually be far from it.
1500,Ellen Garfield,Talk about a page turner! I could not put it down. Move over Gone Girl.
1501,♣Stephanie♣,"When is this going to be a movie? I'm serious. It seems like they make movies of books half this good so....??? This is brilliant. I took a chance on it (I got the audio version) and am glad I used a free Audible credit for it. WORTH IT. This is an alternating POV story of three women who's lives intertwine. The characters are so vivid and real. I have to say I think they are the most real characters I've read in a long time. Rachel is an alcoholic, a little pathetic, but sympathetic. I found that even though she comes across as terrible in the beginning I liked her anyway - maybe b/c I could understand her sorrow and why she was driven to drink. She was weak, but knew it. She grew over the course of the book and I found myself liking her even more. Megan comes across as flighty and manipulative at times. As her story develops you can see the trauma in her past and why she runs away from everything and why she has such deep seated issues. She's a likable character even though she's a mess and doesn't start off seeming like a good person. You learn more about her as the story progresses. Anna....well...she's never anything but a terrible horrible B. From the first moment she comes into the story to the last she is hateful and cruel. I actually liked this about her (as a literary character) because I hated her so much, every time she opened her mouth. It's rare when I want to punch a character in the face so badly - so I love that the author could create someone so hateful. But as for Anna herself, ugh. Whiny, nasty, all around terrible person. I don't think I ever felt for her (aside from rage). There are quite a few other side characters - a mix of ok and pure awful. The story is simple, it's the characters and how they intermix that gets complex. I didn't find the ending totally a surprise - there were parts of it that were twists, but I didn't think it was totally a shocker (i.e. I could understand how it happened the way it did, but I didn't anticipate it). Highly recommended read - or listen - the quality of the audio is great. The voice actresses really made the characters real (vs sounding like a person reading a book - this was the best narration I've heard to date with audio books)"
1502,Claire Dobson,An intricately woven plot which keeps you gripped from start to finish. A definite must read for people who love thrillers!
1503,Macy,"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!*all the feels* within the last 5 or so pages. I honestly had low expectations of this book because everyone spoke so highly of it, and it was consistently rated as an excellent book. Typically, I tend to deviate in my literary tastes when it comes to popular ""excellent"" writing. This book did NOT disappoint, though. I was literally on the edge of my seat as I read the last few chapters, and that's the kind of thing that's only happened with *some* of Mary Higgins Clark's books. I LOVE that I wasn't completely sure of who did it until I was about 3/4 of the way through the book...and even then I was doubtful that I was right. I do have some questions, though, mostly like what happened to all of the other key players. But Hawkins definitely delivered...I can only hope that Dreamworks does her writing justice. Reflecting on my experience with this book, I feel giddy...like a schoolgirl with the juiciest gossip, or a child with $5 that I just can't wait to spend. I am so happy that this book was well-written...I needed a book like this in my life right about now. I hope she continues writing and that her future books are just as good, if not better."
1504,Caitlin,"Wow! This book had me on the edge of my seat and I had a really hard time putting it down. I loved how the characters were so intertwined and how the secrets of their lives were slowly revealed. I did have some of it figured out before the end, but the added twists and inclusion of background stories of the characters prevented me from completely guessing what was going to happen. It certainly is a darker story and one that deals with some topics that aren't usually discussed, but I think it's done in a tasteful way and opens up means for communicating about those topics. I felt it was very well written. This one will stay with me for awhile."
1505,Danielle Bartos,"Each character is so flawed and in so many ways. You keep guessing in your head what really happened. You think it makes sense, but it's never right. And then you see it all come together...and it's mind blowing! "
1506,Briana Cavaness,Great book with a lot of unforeseeable twists that keeps you wanting to read more. 
1507,Jodie Downes,"Every spare moment I found, I devoured this book. Realistic, somewhat horrible characters with lives all twisted and connected. Secrets, suspense and suspicions; I figured it out pretty quickly but it still didn't take away from the revelation. The main character, Rachel would have been shaken so hard had she been real - she infuriated me. All the characters had their irksome traits and it was interesting to see the social side versus the private side of characters; much like life. Exciting and thrilling, I loved it!"
1508,Kellie Ann,"There are not many times that I can honestly say I was sad to finish a book, but “The Girl on the Train” did exactly that. This book is a complete masterpiece that never leaves your mind, even when you are not reading it you are thinking about it. Every character is perfectly developed, allowing the reader to create such an emotional connection with them and what they have been through. “The Girl on the Train” is not only a mysterious thriller, but also a gut-wrenching look into the the life of someone who suffers from addiction and obsession. Full of twist and turns this book is an emotional roller coaster that keeps the reader wanting more. “The Girl on the Train” is a must read for everyone. "
1509,Mary Dole,Fast read that had my attention from start to finish!
1510,Rocio Gutierrez,omg! esta muy buena la historia jamas pense que el era el culpable; es mas llegue a dudar de la misma protagonista.
1511,N,"I was very skeptical about this book at first. I wasn't sure I would like it or that it would be good enough to keep my attention past the first few pages. Though it was not super interesting from the beginning, you have to really read past the first chapter or two to really get into this book. Personally, I loved and really enjoyed reading this book. It was definitely a good read as it somehow managed to capture my attention and keep me anxious and wondering for more. It's a great suspense filled novel that though the plot may seem clear and though there are many clues as to what is really happening somehow you refuse to even consider it, and so it really is a great read. "
1512,Gurdeep Assi,"As this book was highly recommended, i couldn't wait to get my hands on it. When i bought myself a copy i started it pretty much straight away. I have to say i was hooked from the very first page. It is gripping and it leaves you wanting to read the next page and the next... I thoroughly enjoyed it. There are some clever twists involved which the reader doesn't expect and the story keeps you guessing untill the end, it's unpredictable and engrossing. This is the kind of book that leaves you thinking about it for days after you've read it and that's usually a good thing. The characters were well formed, as well as the setting, definitely a thumbs-up! I am going to have a book hang-over now after reading this. Five big shiny stars this book deserves."
1513,Donna,"This is about a woman who has lost her sense of self, lost everything but her life. She is unable to move on. Her husband has remarried and they have a child. Rachel, the girl on the train, has moved in with a friend and has lost her job, though she rides in every day to the city on the train, trying not to have to tell her friend that she is jobless, that she got fired. While riding the train, she watches the neighborhood she used to live in, and a couple in one of the houses captured her imagination. She gives them names and fantasizes about their lives. Then there is a murder. No one knows who has done it. Rachel imagines her own scenario from what she has observed while watching while on the train. The characters are well drawn, the narration perfect, giving the female characters definitive voices. You can feel them, hear them, know them. The author narrates from each of the main female voices. We mostly can empathize with Rachel, even though she has let herself go physically and drinks herself into oblivion. Even though she has lost herself. I highly recommend this book. Some say ""better than Gone Girl"" but I would not go that far. It was very good, on its own merits. I am glad I listened to it rather than reading it. It really brought the characters to life for me. And it is told by the female characters. "
1514,Myre,"I'm giving this a 5 star rating because I really, really enjoyed this book and the whole concept is just so amazing. Even though I already figured out who the culprit is from the first few pages, I still find myself holding my breath in some parts or sticking my nose on the screen as if I can magically enter inside the book and see it all happen with my own eyes. I was wretched when I finished reading it and I wish I could read this for the first time again.Very thought provoking and intriguing. People who liked Gone Girl should read this. "
1515,Argyle Doll," I never thought there could be a book that would rattle my mental state like this did! It's filled with characters that are driven by their own ego and pride, almost to the point that some are just rotten to the core, but that's what makes this book that good! Like a train ride, nothing in this story is a smooth ride, it has sharp turns and moves rapidly. You simply have to brace yourself and hope you are ready when it all comes to a screeching halt!  "
1516,Myra,"I can't remember the last time I holed myself up in the house, tucked into my favorite chair on a lazy weekend, and devoured a book from cover to cover. I know there are different renditions of reader experiences here. Maybe I'm easy to please when it comes to psychological thrillers. But I could not put.this.book.down. And also, probably unlike many, I didn't see the ending coming. I'm not really sure what I thought was going to happen, I just had to keep turning pages. Yes, I know. This is supposed to be the ""modern"" Gone Girl (which I also read, but more slowly). But I disagree. This book is in a class of its own: a creepy character study that requires you to turn over events again and again long after you've read the last page. For that reason alone, I have to congratulate Hawkins. I don't usually like this genre. Creepy unnerves me, and murder mysteries aren't my thing. But if you weave in some amazing characters, and artfully written dialogue, I might just have to stick with it until I've soaked in every last word.I can't wait to see if the movie matches my image of the book."
1517,Michelle Feist,Awesome! A gripping thriller that truly keeps you guessing until the end - and what an ending! 
1518,Ashley Roberts,"Best book I've read all summer! Wish there was a sequel!!! I literally could not put this book down! Now, for another page turner??"
1519,Dina,Massively enjoyed this book. ITCHING to write a thriller now!!
1520,Mish,"The Girl on the Train is told by the viewpoint of three troubled women whose lives intertwined through a series of lies, manipulation, infidelity and possible murder. The heart of the story is Rachel Watson, a lonely, broken alcoholic who travels back and forth by train to a job that no longer exists. The train stops at a signal where she has clear view her old house, that bring back memories of a marriage filled with sadness and betrayal. A few houses down, she observes a seemingly perfect, loving couple conversing on their deck. They are a reminder of what she once had, loved and lost. She starts to fantasies about them. Naming them and imagining what they do for a living. Eventually this innocent observation turns into an unhealthy fixation, when she witnesses something out of the ordinary that really upsets her, and she feels it’s necessary to become personally involved.The Girl on the Train is a captivating debut novel that had my stomach in knots the whole time from worry and tension. There was an all-important criminal investigation running alone side the plot but for some reason it didn’t hold my attention until it was all revealed at the very end. My major concern was Rachel’s alcoholism; how remarkably real and believable it was. Rachel has a history of blackout during her drinking binges. And it was during these blackouts that her behavior spiraled out of control and was appalling. And in some cases it would appear as threatening. When she sobered up, she was not fully aware of what she had done, or what is real, or what is a figment of her imagination. The unreliability of her narrative and the unknown truths behind the blackouts made it an additive and suspenseful read. Yet it was frustrating and disconcerting that she wasn’t taking these episodes more seriously, where as I – like her housemate - would react quite strongly. Skillfully plotted and a first class psychological thriller that’s so easy to read. Which is ideal, because there’s so many twist and uncertainties you want to devour it really quickly."
1521,Darlene Quinn,"Although this book did not hook me on the opening, it was brilliantly plotted. The chosen construction is difficult to pull off, but Hawkins did it to perfection. The story begins in the middle, goes forward for short periods and is filled in through a number of flashbacks. I purchased the audio book edition, which is they way I like to try unfamiliar authors. While the opening was not the most compelling, it held my interest and I would not have laid it aside. Hawkins has four believable suspects keeping readers guessing to the very end. When I came to the last twist, I knew I would want to replay this novel from the beginning. The story was told from the viewpoints of 3 women. There were no unreliable narrators. Since the novel I am currently working on will have a two or three month flashback, this was a terrific novel to study. I enjoyed it the second time around even more than the first."
1522,Aja ,"I love it when an author makes me care about unlikable people. Sharp writing, nothing contrived. Very, very nicely done. "
1523,Rachel,IS THIS A JOKE. THIS HAS TO BE A JOKE. OH MY GOD WHAT EVEN IS THIS BOOK I CAN'T BREATHE.
1524,Angie IsA ReadingMachine,"Simply amazing. I listened to the audio version. The three female narrators representing the three different povs did an excellent job. Their voices were pleasant and their acting skills were spot on. Rachel Watson is a drunk. She lost her husband, her home, her job. She's been divorced for two years but she's still having trouble accepting it. She misses Tom, even though he left her for another woman and he's happy with her and their baby. Rachel takes the train every day and she's become a bit obsessed with a beautiful couple that she sees in their house from the train window. She's made up names for them and given them a story. They are her ideal couple. They remind her of what she used to have. But one day she sees something out of the train window that bursts her perfect image. And witnessing this one thing gets her caught up in a very intriguing mystery.Megan seems to have it all but her life is not as ideal as it appears. She has quite the secret.Anna is the new Mrs. Watson. She's had it up to here with Rachel drunk dialing Tom and walking by the house all the time. But she and Rachel may have more in common than she wants to admit.Hawkins takes her time letting us get to know the characters. Rachel's story is tragic but I was rooting for her the entire time. Hawkins kept me guessing all the way til the end. Bravo!"
1525,Debra Trueman,"Wow, this was one great book! A psychological thriller on the order of Gone Girl, completely unsettling, yet impossible to put down. The main character was pretty much void of any redeeming qualities, but somehow, I was still pulling for her. The narrator changes back and forth with each chapter and that works so well in this book. The author did a great job of unfolding the plot, thanks in large part to the methodical pace of the story. What a great job of building the tension, chapter by chapter, as Rachel makes one giant blunder after another. This is one of the best book I've read recently. "
1526,Mark De leon,"This book is sooooooooooooo good!I read it so fast because the book demands to not be put down for anything. The story moves along at a quick pace, but it keeps you guessing constantly.The book revolves mainly around three women, Rachel, Megan, and Anna. All three women are linked to one major event and one character in particular. What starts off as a missing person's investigation, quickly turns into a homicide investigation with lethal danger lurking for our key characters.The story has the pulse of a thriller and the suspense of a mystery novel that throws red herrings your way each time you think you know who's behind it all. And, when the big reveal happens in the last act of the book, you just aren't sure who's going to survive.Paula Hawkins crafted a novel that consumes you almost immediately. Her insight into alcoholism, and how she employs it with one of our main characters, is amazingly on point and adds more weight to the story. I also have to give Hawkins major props for her non-linear approach. What could have been confusing and convoluted in a lesser author's hands works to perfection in this novel.I wholeheartedly recommend this book with no reservations and I only wish that I had an option to give this six stars. If Hawkins has any more like this coming up, I'll be the first in line to buy the book. "
1527,Rita Bourke,"Please, Rachel, don't take that drink. Pour it down the sink. Don't make that phone call. Quit harassing your ex-husband. Quit peering out the train window at those two houses you pass every day. But Rachel answers only to the demons within her. She takes that drink, makes that call, rides that train, and she sinks lower and lower into a morass of lies. She staggers from pub to the streets of London to one or the other of those two houses, and all we want is for her to get her life back together. I hope the movie is half as good as the book. "
1528,Angie,"4.5 stars...This started off slow and not my favorite, but the more I got to know Rachel, the more involved I got in the story. At first I thought it was a book full of crazy, unlikable people and I dreaded listening to it. But, About a third in, I really fell into the story and was excited about what would be revealed next. Another reviewer mentioned they ""got"" Rachel and that is exactly how I felt! I could understand & empathize with what happened/was happening to Rachel and with her thoughts & emotions. I started to care about her and could see how she got to where she (and at least one other character) was. I think if you don't reach that point, you won't like the book very much. The train perspective was interesting too. Almost every character in this book is dysfunctional in some way, but that made for an entertaining read;) As far as it being like Gone Girl, I personally don't really think so. They both are full of unlikable people and are suspenseful as things get revealed but IMO this was better. I know many will disagree, but that's just me:)"
1529,Shannon,"An absolutely engrossing, amazing mystery! Have you ever experienced something so good, that words fail you? All you can come up with are gasps and hand gestures and other assorted noises of awe and titillation? This book has done that for me..."
1530,Brittany Goldfield,I don't have any words. This book stressed me out in the best way possible.
1531,Stef Ploof,"I'm sad that there are no more fiction books by Paula Hawkins, I really enjoyed this. I figured out what was going on about 2/3 of the way through but that did not stop me from thoroughly enjoying it!"
1532,Tara at Running 'n' Reading,"Tell me I'm not the only one who's played this game: you see a couple in a restaurant or bar and you make up your own version of their life or the conversation that they are having; you imagine what their life together must be like, good or bad, and wonder what goes on behind closed doors. The Girl on the Train begins in a similar way and, after you've read this one, I can guarantee that you'll never go through that ""game"" again without thinking of this story.I requested a review copy of this novel before I'd read or heard anything about it; to tell you the truth, I was ready for a mystery and the cover looked interesting. I had no idea what I'd gotten myself into with this one. I've read some early reviews, now that I've finished the book; a couple of ""notable"" reviewers have referred to Ms. Hawkins as an author who is not quite as ""razor sharp"" as Gillian Flynn in Gone Girl, but I beg to differ.There are certainly valid comparisons to be made, but I find Hawkins' characters to be somewhat grittier and riddled with lifelong problems, outside of the ones brought forth by the end of the novel; I couldn't help sympathizing with all of them. They are messy (alcoholism, divorce, infertility), they have secrets (lovers, dead children, unemployment) and they are all brought together by Rachel; she is the girl on the train, envisioning what must be the perfect lives of those individuals who inhabit the homes along her daily ride to work.While there is not much I can tell you, plot-wise, for fear of spoiling a tale that has lots of twists and turns, I will say that I was completely drawn in by these characters; even though the chapters are alternatively narrated by the characters, I had no trouble following along and picking up small tidbits about each of them within every page. I was also fascinated with Hawkins' reflection on what it is that we, as human beings, are able to truly remember/recall based on what we've told ourselves about a particular event; memories are often manipulated by the human brain to protect us, without us knowing it, and getting the truth to the surface, as demonstrated in The Girl on the Train, can be a painful experience."
1533,Kade,"As far as those comparing this to Gone Girl [which I read and enjoyed] I don't think this book was at all the same, Gone Girl being intentionally fast paced and sort of hectic while The Girl on the Train takes it time, lets you get to know this horrible group of characters in a way you would a new acquaintance you aren't yet too sure about. I thoroughly enjoyed the lack of some majestic main character that 'did no wrong' and was 'true at heart', this book was far more realistic to the general population as far as their personalities and actions. The story line was sort of paced and stretched out enough to where I found the plot twists and new shocking bits of information to be a pleasantly sharp contrast with the sleepy lives of the characters. The daily drag of the story really had me feeling more connected with the people, made it easier to immerse myself into their lives. If you're the kind of reader that enjoys a book that'll take you places in a more organic fashion, with the sour twists of a good ol' Who-Done-It, I'd highly recommend! "
1534,Cristina Semiao,"Simplesmente espectacular. Muito bem escrito, de forma original, em que a acção é sempre descrita no passado ao estilo de diários que se cruzam das várias personagens. Um thriller excitante ao melhor estilo de Hitchcock. Um dos melhores Whodunit que já li. Recomendo. "
1535,Jayme Prisbell-Hultman,Holy Moly. I not only couldn't put this book down...I started to question my own sanity at times which made me have to go back and double check what I was reading. Though three points of view...the author does a fantastic job clearly identifying each character. Well done.
1536,Danielle,"Everyone in this book is nutty as a fruitcake, and I loved every second of it!"
1537,Diana Dempsey,"THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN by Paula Hawkins was not just a publishing juggernaut last year when it was released. It’s also going down in the history books as the fastest-selling adult novel ever, with two million copies sold in the first four months after its release, according to its publisher, Riverhead. It spent a total of eighteen weeks as a #1 New York Times bestseller, eleven weeks more than GONE GIRL, the “domestic noir” thriller to which it’s most often compared. This fall we’ll be able to compare the movies as well: THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN starring Emily Blunt as Rachel Watson will arrive in theaters in October.The setup is simple: every weekday Rachel rides the train from suburban London into the city, lost in her own small, melancholy world. Invariably she perks up when the train whisks her past the neighborhood where she used to live, closer in and more affluent. Rachel wasn’t alone in those days: she was happily married. But those days are gone, and now Rachel is lost in a miasma of unemployment, poverty, depression, alcoholism, and loneliness. She finds a twisted purpose, though, by fixating on a seemingly perfect couple that lives near her old digs. She can spy them from the train and one day witnesses the female half of that sun-kissed couple doing something she shouldn’t … and we’re off.The book is a page-turner, more creepy and mysterious than frightening, though terrifying moments come when I wondered just what Rachel might be capable of. What had she done? What might she still do? Rachel excels at making bad (and dangerous) decisions, but I rooted for her all the same, which is a tribute to Hawkins’ considerable skill at creating the character. I also had to wonder how many Rachels are out there, living the proverbial “lives of quiet desperation.” Rachel envies women who have more than she does, unaware, at least for a time, that those women are coexisting with their own dashed hopes.The novel is very insular; we’re almost always mired in Rachel’s little world. There are scenes from the points-of-view of other characters, but while those are interesting, to me they’re not as powerful. I want to be back in Rachel’s less-than-clear head, keen to find out whether she’ll live to solve the mystery at the book’s heart, and, more importantly, the riddle of her own life.THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN is Hawkins’ first thriller—and boy, did she hit it out of the park—but she has several published chick-lit novels under her belt as well, under the pen name Amy Silver and with titles like CONFESSIONS OF A RELUCTANT RECESSIONISTA and ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS. The former financial journalist described them to Daily Beast as “fantastic as a learning experience.” I got a chuckle out of the author’s bio on Amazon: “She lives in London and has a penchant for vintage clothes and champagne cocktails, but she always pays her credit card bills on time.” And that was before she wrote a record-breaking bestselling novel. Kudos to her."
1538,Tia,"""It's impossible to resist the kindness of strangers. Someone who looks at you, who doesn’t know you, who tells you it’s OK, whatever you did, whatever you’ve done: you suffered, you hurt, you deserve forgiveness."" -The Girl on the Train (Paula Hawkins).It had taken me a while to finish this book because of two deaths in the family, a newborn baby, and school textbooks consuming most of my reading time. So, you can imagine how excited I was to finally have some free time to finish this book over my holiday break.The characters in this book are so easy to hate. Yes, every single character in this book is an asshole. There were moments that I wanted to shoot each one. I do not want to give away too much because you should really read this book without having any knowledge of the characters, their past, and their habits.#TheGirlOnTheTrain is a GREAT read. I gave it five ⭐️s on GoodReads. I highly recommend this book and I cannot wait to see what the author, #PaulaHawkins has in store."
1539,O Informador,"Estar atento e deixar que a imaginação comece a funcionar nem sempre corre bem na vida de uma viajante no tempo, tal como o que aconteceu com A Rapariga no Comboio, Rachel. Numa obra onde a verdade se liga com a imaginação neste thriller os factos são transformados pela pura criação que alguém vai fazendo ao longo do tempo simplesmente através da observação de vidas desconhecidas até então. Paula Hawkins é uma das autoras do momento com este livro que tem feito furor junto de leitores assíduos dos mais vendidos e não só. Confesso que comprei este livro por ter de reforçar as leituras que tinha levado comigo de férias e por ser o melhor classificado na tabela de vendas. Se errei na escolha? Nada disso, bem pelo contrário!A Rapariga no Comboio é um dos livros do ano, sem dúvida alguma! Com uma morte a dar o mote para os desenvolvimentos seguintes, rapidamente as personagens entram em acção e ganham relevo junto do leitor que tenta a todo o custo decifrar quem poderá ser o verdadeiro culpado de todo o mistério que envolve o desaparecimento de Megan. Qual a explicação para uma mulher supostamente feliz num casamento desaparecer subitamente sem deixar rasto? As verdades vão aparecendo, sempre com toques imaginativos de personagens que acreditam ter visto uma coisa quando na realidade o álcool as transforma noutras. Como uma simples viagem consegue transformar a vida de alguém que sempre se tentou manter a leste? Como o passado desse alguém fica subitamente envolvido num caso com que aparentemente nada tem em comum consigo? Uma complexa história onde os poucos envolvidos chegam perfeitamente para levar o suspense embutido nestas mais de trezentas páginas em frente. Deverei confessar que o culpado de toda esta situação envolvente só foi descoberto por mim mesmo perto do final de tudo, quando o círculo se começa a apertar e já poucos suspeitos podem ter mistérios omitidos nas suas vidas.Violência, alcoolismo, amor, traição, mistério, homicídios, viagens e ligações pessoais são os principais bombons que A Rapariga no Comboio serve aos seus leitores através de uma escrita fluida, sem grandes oscilações e onde três mulheres vão reflectindo sobre o que têm sido as suas vidas ao longo de pouco mais de um ano, onde o passado vai sendo contado ao lado do presente. Um livro aconselhado e que deixa os leitores agarrados até que o final apareça e a perda de controlo de cada criação ficcional seja desvendada!"
1540,Jaime O'neal,Great Book!!
1541,Sonali Talwar,"This book was overall very dark, depressing and full of surprises and I enjoyed all of it. It's one of those books that you either love it or you hate it. For me, the writing was amazing. It was a thriller and it was the kind of book that made your heart beat faster and faster, page by page. Every character in the book is dealing with a lot and that could be viewed as very irritating, but to me, it just made it better. The ending is what I enjoyed the most and was very satisfying. It has to be one of my favorites and I can't wait for the movie! "
1542,Grace {Rebel Mommy Book Blog},"4.5 StarsThe Girl on the Train has been the buzz book for a while now. I couldn’t wait to read it – but I had to because of the monstrous waiting list at my library. But alas my wait was over and I couldn’t have been happier. This is a hard review to write because it is pretty much a less you know the better it is type of story so it might be a bit brief – but it’s for the best I promise!“The whole thing was actually your fault, Rachel.”We start with Rachel. On a train. The Girl on the Train. See that we got the title settled straight away. Whew! We start with her whizzing past houses on her way into the city. As it goes on we see her preoccupation with a couple, who she has named Jess and Jason. I will say the beginning was a bit disconcerting, especially with dates at the beginning of each chapter. This always jams me up in a book because I can never remember what the dates are, if we are going back at a point in time or forward or chronologically following the story. When I finally got my bearings I got what it all was and was on my way into the dark and twisty world that this book was.We have the narration broken down into Morning and Evening with multiple POVs including Rachel, Megan (Jess as Rachel initially refers to her as) and Anna who is Rachel’s ex-husband’s new wife.“I have lost control over everything, even the places in my head.”Right away I knew Rachel wasn’t all there but wasn’t sure if she was just plain old crazy or something else. You do find out her story as it slowly unfolds helping to put a lot of things seen earlier into perspective.“He never understood that it’s possible to miss what you’ve never had, to mourn for it.”The Megan part of the story is a little while before Rachel’s. We see her life with Scott ( aka Jason) and her interactions with Anna, who is her neighbor.“He loves me so much, it makes me ache.”Anna comes into the book and we see her views of both Megan and Rachel. She doesn’t think much of either of them, especially Rachel. We see her life with Rachel’s ex husband and their new baby.These three women’s lives are so interconnected, whether it be clear or less obvious, that they all wind up playing a large part in each other’s lives in some way. Also, they are all kind of terrible and totally unreliable. And that made it fun!“The holes in your life are permanent. You have to grow around them, like tree roots around concrete; you mould yourself through the gaps.”The entire time I was reading this I had this queazy, uneasy, anxious feeling. Thankfully it didn’t last long because I couldn’t put it down and flew through the story. I loved its dark tone, fast pace and how well it was written. I love multiple points of view and liked the Morning/Evening dynamic. I think I “figured it out” pretty late in the game (like probably when she meant for me to) and it was still great getting to the finish to find out what happens. If you love psychological thrillers, liked Gone Girl or want to find out what all the hype is about – I say go for it. It lives up to all the buzz.See other reviews at Rebel Mommy Book Blog"
1543,Tbop,"Such an easy, yet entertaining read!"
1544,Brandi Montgomery,"I love a good psycho thriller! Gone Girl was too sick and twisted for me, but this one had just the right amount of crazy to keep me interested. "
1545,Summer Szell,"This book will rope you into its madness from page one. Told from several perspectives, it has the perfect ingredients for a great thriller. It was a book I couldn't wait to pick up again once I put it down."
1546,Rebecca Kane,A page turner. 
1547,Jamie Jones,"I LOVED this book! I couldn't put it down! I really knew nothing about this book, but once I started reading it I couldn't stop. "
1548,Phyllis,"Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning. Every day she rattles down the track, flashes past a stretch of cozy suburban homes, and stops at the signal that allows her to daily watch the same couple breakfasting on their deck. She’s even started to feel like she knows them. “Jess and Jason,” she calls them. Their life—as she sees it—is perfect. Not unlike the life she recently lost.And then she sees something shocking. It’s only a minute until the train moves on, but it’s enough. Now everything’s changed. Unable to keep it to herself, Rachel offers what she knows to the police, and becomes inextricably entwined in what happens next, as well as in the lives of everyone involved. Has she done more harm than good?A compulsively readable, emotionally immersive, Hitchcockian thriller that draws comparisons to Gone Girl, The Silent Wife, or Before I Go to Sleep, this is an electrifying debut embraced by readers across markets and categories.My Review::I absolutely loved this book. It was very hard to put it down. I was so engrossed with trying to solve the crime. Any character could have committed it. I was definitely surprised with the ending!!"
1549,Nanci,Wow! What a page turner... Full of suspense. Couldn't put it down until I finished it. 
1550,Katie (Kitkatscanread),"Oh man I loved this book!It was so interesting, and for an adult novel - which I don't normally read - I really enjoyed it.I'm either really gullible, or its done well, but it had me guessing all the time.The main protagonists aren't very likeable. But strangely I ended up somewhat liking them...I guess I'm very sadistic in that way haha.But definitely a good read that I'd recommend."
1551,Jocelyn,"I started this book around 7AM Thursday morning; I finished it at 11AM Friday morning. Brilliant, tense, electrifying. I was guessing and second-guessing until the very end. I felt myself identifying with parts of each narrator and sympathizing and hating them in equal measure. I couldn't read this fast enough, and I am absolutely dying to get my hands on everything Paula Hawkins writes from here on out. I read this book partially as a Girl on the Train, and it was an incredible experience from beginning to end."
1552,Elaine G,"After reading a lot of good things about this book, including a positive tweet from Stephen King, I was dying to read it. But, so was everyone else in San Diego county, so I resigned myself to spot 908 on the library’s hold list. Amazingly, I walked into the library a few days ago and saw “The Girl on the Train” sitting right there on the “new book” shelf. I grabbed it and hid it under my other pick-ups, hoping spots 1-907 wouldn’t see me with it. You know those Dear Abby stories about “pennies from Heaven”? I periodically get books from Somewhere. Just last month as I was walking through the library my eye caught a small paperback on the 50-cent-please-get-rid-of-these-books shelf. It was Thomas Harris’ “Black Sunday”! The only Thomas Harris book I haven’t read, and as it’s rather obscure I was surprised to find it waiting for me. It’s nice to have a literary guardian angel watching out for you.Anyways, I loved “The Girl on the Train”. So it goes: Rachel takes the train into London every day. At a signal stop, she gazes at her favorite house where her favorite couple, Jason and Jess live. She sees them drinking coffee on the terrace every morning and fantasizes about their lives, personalities and relationship. One day, she sees “something bad”. She gets terribly involved in these strangers lives, and it begins to consume her own. Of course, things are never as they seem in this book. We go back and forth from the POV of the three affected women (but primarily Rachel), as well as through 2012 through 2013. Instead of free flowing, each dated entry is broken into Morning, Afternoon and Evening, which I thought I would dislike, but ended up appreciating. This is a proper thriller, fast-paced and imminently readable. A study of relationships: how well do you actually know the people in your life, and do you truly know what they are capable of? And furthermore, can you trust your own memories and instincts?Read along: continuing on the British streak, I’m reading my first Nick Hornby novel, “How to be Good”. "
1553,Nancy,intense read. I could not put it down.
1554,Francesca,"Rachel sits on a train, drinking gin-and-tonic from a can and making up stories about the couple she sees when her train stops at a signal, ""Jess and Jason"" in her little fantasy. All very simple, except that there's three more cans in her bag to drink on this commute, the couple's house is only three houses down from Rachel's old house where her ex now lives with his new wife and baby, and Rachel's life is a bit of a mess. And then one night she tries to go see her ex-husband after one too many bottle of wine. She wakes up the next morning with scarce recollection of the night before, and in the paper learns that ""Jess"" has disappeared, and she has a nagging feeling that she has the key information needed to uncover what's happened, but what does she know, what has she mis-remembered, and what has she only dreamed? "
1555,Roger Smitter,This is a challenging and very satisfying novel. It has much of the typical murder mystery and yet is written in a sophisticated way that kept me going thru a complex plot with multiple characters. The time-line of the novel is noted in the text. It would be useful to keep track of the dates in order to understand the action. 
1556,Melanie Johnson,"Add this to your Wish List. Now. This will be one of the ""It"" books of 2015. I read this book all in one day, because I could not put it down. I even cooked family dinner while reading. (Family dinner wasn't pretty). As Rachel rides the train every day, she looks out the window at the houses that she passes. At one particular house, she sees the same couple, day after day, sitting on their porch, drinking coffee. She begins to imagine their life and even makes up names for them. As she imagines their perfect life, one day she sees something that startles her. The women is kissing someone that is not her husband. Take your shower early, put your dinner in a Crock-Pot, and put your phone on silent. This is the beginning of a twisty, exciting and suspenseful ride.I received this ARC from First to Read"
1557,BookNerdette," The worth of a book is to be measured by what you can carry away from it. ~James Bryce This is an exceptional story that hit home with me. I needed this book, it has made me think and therefore it will change my life. I am so thankful I stepped outta my normal genre to read this one. No wonder it is on Amazons Best Seller list.Now the story is based in London so my narrator's had british accents.. I loved Them. There were three narrator's for the ladies and they did a great job. Well Anna's narrator was stiff in the beginning, she just read with no feeling. But thankfully she warmed up. I ♡ it and Highly recommend it."
1558,Verylazydaisy,"I loved this book. We've got three POVs and they vary in degrees of unreliability as far as narration goes. Rachel, a pathetic drunk who I was rooting for as I read her struggles. Every time she stumbled, my heart broke for her. I enjoyed her time on the train as she looked out at the lives along the tracks. Then there's Megan, who really challenged my ability to like her at first. And Anna, who I loathed for the greater part of the story. I could not put it down, literally. I was bumping into walls going about my day because I was reading. Contrary to some reviews, it's not ""the next Gone Girl"".. It wasn't anything like Gone Girl, unless you count that it's a book and its a mystery. It's a who/whydunnit and I enjoyed it all the way up to the reveal. There's a bit of a monologue/info dump toward the end, but with this kind of story, that's almost unavoidable and it doesn't take away from my 5 star review. I know this is vague but with a mystery, I like to be careful about spoilers. "
1559,Brittany,"HOLY. CRAP. Paula Hawkins is good...left me wondering who did it up until the very end. The whole time I seriously thought any of 5 people could have done it. Huge plot twist...something I didn't see coming. I was kind of able to put some of the pieces together but I surely doubted myself. I know there are some murder mystery books where you can usually spot ""who done it"" early on but this one kept me guessing for chapters! So good...two thumbs up...I can't say more because I don't want to ruin it. But, READ THIS BOOK! I'm now a big fan of Paula Hawkins! "
1560,Lois Bouchard,"Page TurnerCouldn't put it down! It's 2:20 am, and I have to be up at 7:30, but I had to finish.I read this in a couple of days. I actually would have read it faster, but I'm also reading 2 other books. It is really gripping. In this case, I really liked the fact that the story was told from the points of view of all three main female protagonists. Comparison to Gone Girl? No. Only in the fact that there were many twists and turns throughout the book. The plot was totally different. The setting was totally different. The characters were not at all the same. Isn't ""edge of your seat"" what you want? Stop comparing it to anything else, and start reading it."
1561,Miranda (M.E.) Brumbaugh,"Could not put it down. Excellent just a real edge-of-your-seat story. Highly recommended to anyone who likes mystery, thrillers, psychological intrigue. It has you guessing until the very absolute last second. What a ride!"
1562,Vivian Smith,"I really enjoyed The Girl on the Train. It was a very interesting story with so many turns and twist, it was hard to put the book down. I enjoyed how the author connected all the characters' stories over the period of a few months to reveal the climax of the book. I was angry at Rachel one minute and sympathizing with her the next. At times I thought, ""Come on Rachel get it together!"" or ""I see why Tom did...."" In the end, I realize that although she made bad decisions she was struggling with very real and all to common problems. "
1563,eileen Hoover,"A real page turnerEvery one of the main characters in this book is not what they seem. With lots of craziness evident in the behavior of several of them, it soon becomes clear why a psychiatrist is a central character.But nothing is simple or easily explained. The original premise of a young woman watching a couple in their back yard as her commuter train goes by daily and imagining their life together quickly turns into a complicated involvement into those lives. With a haze of alcoholism clouding her memories and her judgements, she becomes dangerously entangled before she is able to figure out who is truly evil.This story kept me on the edge of my seat and I predict it will have the same effect on most readers."
1564,Kari,"A fun thriller set outside London, told from the POV of three different women, all of whom are completely unreliable. Reminded me a bit of Gone Girl.Summary from library catalog:Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning. Every day she rattles down the track, flashes past a stretch of cozy suburban homes, and stops at the signal that allows her to daily watch the same couple breakfasting on their deck. She's even started to feel like she knows them. ""Jess and Jason,"" she calls them. Their life-as she sees it-is perfect. Not unlike the life she recently lost. And then she sees something shocking. It's only a minute until the train moves on, but it's enough. Now everything's changed. Unable to keep it to herself, Rachel offers what she knows to the police, and becomes inextricably entwined in what happens next, as well as in the lives of everyone involved. Has she done more harm than good? Compulsively readable, The Girl on the Train is an emotionally immersive, Hitchcockian thriller and an electrifying debut."
1565,Catherine Leggitt,"Do you imagine other people lead lives packed with adventure and happiness because they look good on the outside? I do. The premise of this book fascinated and tantalized me from the opening scene.Each day, Rachel takes the train to work in London. At one of the regular stops along the way, she studies the houses beside the track. Over time, she invents a story about the people who live there. She often spies a handsome young couple eating breakfast on the terrace, and names them Jess and Jason. Like dolls in a dollhouse, Jason and Jess lead the perfect carefree life.Only it's not true.As the tangled web of secrets and lies in her own life unravels, Rachel inserts herself into this fantasy world. The complex plot moves with a plodding certainty, revealing an increasingly horrid truth--a truth I didn't see coming. Nothing is as it seems. The chilling conclusion is masterfully written.This very well constructed mystery is told in the first person from three quite different viewpoints. The characters are well-drawn and intriguing, although there's not a mentally healthy person in the whole story. The craziness and surprising connections between them adds dimension and sparkle. For a debut novel, this one is special. I'm looking forward to Paula Hawkins' next offering."
1566,Sarah Talbot,"4.5 StarsI went in to this book with little idea what it was about and I would suggest this is the best way with thrillers; just go for it.The Girl On the Train falls into the thriller/mystery category and I could hardly put it down! The story begins during a seemingly normal week for our key character, Rachel. She commutes daily to London and has grown to know the train route like the back of her hand. Then something changes and immediately Rachel knows something has gone wrong. She thinks that she can help. She becomes obsessed in solving this mystery.Over the course of the book we follow a missing persons case and the finger is pointed at nearly every character, so you're really kept on your toes. What also keeps you guessing is the multiple perspectives this book gives you; Rachel, Megan and Anna are our 3 protagonists (Rachel is the most heavily featured POV though). This makes the book a really quick read.Now character-wise, I would go as far as to say that there is not one character that is likeable and this was actually quite refreshing. The reader can never be sure who has a clean slate or who is a compulsive liar. It's full of messed up characters who have so many flaws. The only thing I didn't enjoy was sometimes Rachel's chapters seemed a little repetitive - just a cloudy overview of the same moment in time with little added clarity. By about page 250 I thought I had this mystery solved and then BAM, it came hurtling towards me and hit me so suddenly. I was so wrong with my conclusion and in a way I was glad that I was. I was so satisfied with the conclusion this novel came to and I will definitely be on the look out for any more of Paula Hawkins' novels. This novel has apparently been selected to be made in to a film and I think it has amazing potential."
1567,Dale Philbrick,"A few things about this book: - I loved this book! - The main narrator, Rachel, is a MESS! Talk about unreliable narrators... - Although I thought the book had a tone and topic similar to Gone Girl, I didn't find it to be redundant or distracting.This story revolves around Rachel, a divorced, alcoholic, depressed mess do a woman who rides a train into London everyday to a job that she lost months ago. The train happens to pass by her ex-husband's backyard and that of a neighbor. Rachel passes her time vicariously living through the relationship she imagines the neighbors to have. When Rachel witnesses something in the backyard of the neighbors' house and the wife then disappears, Rachel finally has a reason to get up each day. She inserts herself Into the mystery which leads to chaos for her and everyone involved. Is Rachel right on her assumptions or is she hallucinating through drunken spells? It's a fun and surprising ride to find it all out."
1568,Janet Stone,excellent!
1569,thebookfox,"Loved it! Loved it loved it loved it!It's no secret, I love psychological thrillers and I personally believe this one deserves all the hype. It's getting compared to Gone Girl quite a lot and while I usually hate it when books do that, in this case I feel it was quite appropriate (I also loved Gone Girl, in case that isn't clear). No complaints from me :)Cannot WAIT for the film to be released!! Video review: https://youtu.be/uDPkAiH1xis"
1570,Pamela,"""The Girl on the Train,"" written by Paula Hawkins is a book that I could not put down. It is a book that takes place constantly changing between the three perspectives of three women named Rachel Watson, Anna, and Megan. The lives of these women do collide with each other, but not always in a positive way. This book is a hands down thriller kind of book and is hard hitting with suspense and action, even though half of the time, the pacing is quick and you may have no idea what is taking place next, or at the moment. Rachel is an unhappy ex-wife, who drinks away her pain in which her ex-husband, Tom, has begun a new family with a woman he was seeing. Bet you can't guess who. Well, it was Anna. Rachel's memory is frequently clogged and fogged due to her 'blind drinking.' She gets up some days and gets on the train frequently, and passes by some houses. On her trip, she always tends to see this happy couple on the balcony of their home, as they may appear. Rachel, in her mind, labels them Jess and Jason, and loves the way they're so happy and the 'perfect couple.' This 'perfect couple' is Megan and Scott Hipwell, who are neighbors with Tom and Anna. These three character's stories and points of views constantly collide, and everything seems to be flowing along (even Rachel's depression), until something terrible happens to the ideal couple, and it is Rachel who begins to look around for clues, and tries to remember. I definitely recommend picking up this book. But be careful– you may not be able to put it back down. I hope you enjoy this story, especially to those suspense-packed readers. "
1571,Erica Bernal,Saw it coming at some point but wasn't sure. I still thought it was very well written and kept my attention. As far as the characters; while they were not likable characters; for the most part I still felt for them. Very glad I was not disappointed 
1572,Lindsey Carpenter,great book!
1573,Brenda Gimenez,Sensacional. No es romance pero me enganchó desde el principio. La intriga de saber qué pasó te hace no querer parar de leer. Lo recomiendo mucho.
1574,Seema,"This book is just unbelievably amazing, i cant even describe how much i loved the ending. The whole book was fascinating, and well written. (Even though i was listening to the audiobook). "
1575,Brandi,"4.5 Stars  ""Something bad happened."" Honestly, my heart is still racing. Those last few chapters were intense. I will try to review properly later -but this is fairly popular book, so my laziness may win over. ;)"
1576,Magg Florio,Wow. This book blew me away!
1577,Teresa Kyle,I enjoyed this book. I don't usually read mysteries because I don't like violence in detail. so if you don't like the gore but want something that keeps you guessing this is the book for you.
1578,melinda,"My mom and I listened to this book on audio as we made the long grueling drive from Texas to Florida. I was hoping for a little distraction at best but audio books usually leave me thinking about everything in the world in my head then having to rewind them every few seconds because I've drifted off again. What I got was utter immersion into the lives of Rachel, Anna, and Megan. The characters were written so well. All three were awful but you also felt for them and understood why they were the way they were. This book kept you guessing the whole time. My mom and I would pause it to discuss theories. We couldn't wait to get back in the car to drive more and discover more clues. At the end I ate a whole bag of sunflower seeds as I sat on the edge of my seat gripping the steering wheel. Haunting. Creepy. Disturbing. Mystery. Misery. Yet real life. Messy. Unbelievable. Lying. Cheating. Absolute perfection. It made me only want to read thrillers. It's one I will re-read in actual print to pick apart the clues and enjoy it all over again. If you liked Gone Girl, you'll love The Girl on the Train."
1579,Katie McKinnie Walters,"You should probably start this on a weekend, especially if you want to get sleep and/or not smack yourself in the face by dropping the book on your head while trying to stay up and read. Gripping and twisty-turny in the best way. "
1580,Michael Sova," The Girl on the Train sounds like it could be the long lost fourth Stieg Larson novel. Instead, it's a brilliant thriller by former financial writer and current New York Times bestselling author Paula Hawkins'. The novel was released earlier this year and hit the literary world like, if you'll pardon the pun, a runaway train. Rachel rides the commuter train to and from work five days a week. Even when she gets fired from her job for being a drunk, she continues the daily commute just to keep appearances up. Her routine doesn't change. She stares out the window, gulps wine or gin and tonics, loathes herself, and tries not to look when, every morning and every night, she passes by her old house and her old life. Her husband has re-married, to a woman he started seeing when he and Rachel were still together. There's a baby now, and the beautiful little girl somehow puts an exclamation point on everything Rachel lost.  A few doors down, she notices a new couple. They're young, attractive and obviously very much in love. Rachel often sees them in their yard or on their small terrace. She fantasizes about them, creating names, occupations and all the different aspects of a storybook marriage. She's into the arts. He's a world traveler. Together, they've got the world on a string. Then, that woman disappears and is later found dead. Rachel believes she may have witnessed something that led to a brutal murder. She contacts police but her drinking issues, cloudy memory and history of harassing her former husband and his new bride make Rachel's claims less than credible. She's still convinced she can help but can't quite remember what she saw or what it might mean. Meanwhile, that old demon alcohol is never far away.  Because of poor eyesight, I've been an avid audio book listener for well over thirty-five years. I consider myself an expert on the subject. As a general rule, I don't care for books with more than one narrator. I find that style of production tends to be distracting and sometimes confusing. In the case of The Girl on the Train, however, that approach is perfect. There is a different narrator for each of the three primary female characters. The story is told from those three points of view and each has its own voice, literally. All three narrators are excellent, and their performance contributes to what's already a fantastic novel. "
1581,Tiffany Mercer,What a bunch of crazy people in this book! Very suspenseful thriller! I really liked the story and definitely did not guess correctly about who was ultimately involved in the murder. I was confused in the beginning because I was focusing so much on the dates of each chapter that I never saw the names of who was narrating each one. Pay attention to that!! Lol. I also really enjoyed the writing (which was based in another country) because of the differences in spelling and language. For example color is spelled colour and yogurt is yoghurt. The trunk of a car is called the boot and a fight is a riff. There are so many differences that I always find fascinating! 
1582,Brandy,I think I forgot to breathe while reading the ending. I'm pretty sure I suspected every character at least once.
1583,Yeyenism," That's what the fuss was all about! Wow! This book is a breath of fresh air. I just love psychological books. It really is mind-blowing. I love it's format, the characters and the plot. To me, it's better than Gone Girl--an easier read. I was on the edge of my seat for the parts. Thankfully, I did like the ending. At one point I thought the ending would be a mind-fuck. That Anna would stick with Tom and she would gloat at the facts that Rachel would be out of their lives forever. Although all the female characters are ridiculously insane, Thank goodness they do have some sanity left. I would throw a fit had the ending been different. My only quibbles are the annoyingly confusing shift of tenses. I'm used to reading straight past or present tense, but this one is different. I have to reread and dissect the author's style. Another issue is I just didn't like the way Tom recounted the incident to the ladies, I think it's superfluous. Overall, it's amazing! Excellent job Paula Hawkins! I just don't understand some readers berating the book. Some people just don't get it."
1584,Laura ,"I'm sometimes hesitant to read a book that everyone is reading and talking about, I think because I worry there's no way it will be as good as the buzz around it. I also wasn't planning to read The Girl on the Train because I kept hearing it was the next Gone Girl, a book that I didn't like and actually abandoned (which I hardly ever do). Then I picked this book up at the library on a whim, and once I started reading, I couldn't put it down! The story is told from three different female perspectives: Rachael, Megan, and Anna, and what a great read it is! This book is expertly plotted, fast paced, and the final twist is so perfect (and I'm happy to report that I saw it coming!). This will make a great movie even if I already know how it ends. I'm anxious to see how Hawkins follows up on her very entertaining and successful debut novel."
1585,Heather H,Thank you friend for recommending the book. You know who you are. LOL. At first I had trouble getting into the book because of the hot mess of characters and trying to follow their logic. However it all came together for me in the middle of the book and from there I couldn't put it down. It was a great read. Twist and turns you don't expect. It is Criminal Minds vs. Emotional Connections. Gotta love the mystery of how it unfolds. 
1586,Yasmin - The London Adventurer,"Read the full review: http://wp.me/p3J9eI-m4I’ve heard mixed reviews of this book but I, for one, got exactly what I wanted from it. The story speeds up and slows down just like the train would do at each stop, and at each stop of the story, more options come in for a possible ending, a new possible line for the story to go down, and more options are dismissed. Like Rachel, you don’t exactly know what’s going on at all times, and like waking up with a really bad hangover, you’re frantically trying to figure out what happened.That feeling though, usually means the night before was INCREDIBLE though and so was The Girl on the Train."
1587,Susana Del Campo,Brutal. Hasta el último párrafo. #LClachicadeltren
1588,Andy Rassler,"I love an unreliable narrator! Really makes things cloudy, unpredictable, and ultimately fun. This entire thing read as so authentic. I was especially impressed that all of the narrative voices were distinct, compelling and authentic. At times I wanted to scream at Rachel (You IDIOT! WHY are you making such CRAPPY decisions!!!), but didn't we all? The suspense and mystery of the events were never lost on me and there were numerous interesting twists and shadings in different directions. This is a good, good read. I miss my Blencheim people already! Highly recommend this read."
1589,Kayla Pearce,"Deals with trauma, memory, and trusting your gut. Recommend."
1590,Theresa Poquis,Finally a mystery I didn't figure out in the first fifty pages! I couldn't stop reading!
1591,Pema,"This book was so not how I had expected to be. The part that I expected to be really major like what she sees on the train did not go as planned. I thought that what she saw on the train would be way more horrifying than merely seeing a women cheat on her husband. This lead me off course to just tie up the ends together already and say that the husband must have something to do with her missing because he has a motive. But as I kept reading and reading, things started to unfold bit and bit and the ending was never what I imagined. I was so shocked and creeped out by Tom that he can be so psychologically twisted. I read this book in less than 7 hours and it was all worth it. I kept turning the pages and my fingers just weren't able to stop flipping another page. I am really happy with this even though usually I wouldn't like a book that's as tame as this book, The ending made it all worth it. "
1592,Megs,"OMG! OMG! OMG! OMG! This book was FANTASTIC! I listened to the audio version. The narrators of Rachel and Megan were fantastic. Anna was okay (not bad but not as good as the others). It was a bit confusing as there were three POVs and they were on different timelines but it was not too hard to follow. Reading the book instead of listening to it may be better due to that but I do recommend the audio.Many have compared it to Gone Girl. It was similar but so much more. More suspenseful. More thrilling. Darker. It gave me ""the feels"" but not good ""feels"". I was anxious reading it. There were many times I had to stop listening because I could not handle it. I needed to break away from the book and breathe. All three main characters/narrators were so damaged. I do not think there was a single character that was not a horrible person (minus the psychologist but even he was not perfect). No one was who/what they seemed.I highly recommend this book. Especially if you like thrillers. Mysteries. It was an amazing book."
1593,Kristin Urban,"Good novel to read at the beach, kept me hooked even when I figured out the ending!"
1594,Mairita,"Move on ""Gone Girl"", there's a new bad girl in town!Pilnā atsauksme blogā https://gramatas.wordpress.com/2015/0..."
1595,Barbara Gardner,A very good readThis book kept me interested from beginning to the end. I was constantly engaged with where the plot was taking me. The three ladies telling their respective stories was fascinating. It was like looking into the journals of an actual alcoholic seeing her struggles each day when reading about Rach. When she made the decision to see the psychiatrist I wanted to scream into my kindle and say no you are making a mistake. But when she got there and actually told the truth getting the help she needed I was elated. I was completely in love with this character. When Rach and Anna bonded together to rid themselves of such a horrific situation I wanted to cheer. This was a very good book.
1596,Jonatan,"Wow!!! Simplemente wow!!Una historia que me enganchó desde el primer momento. No quiero comentar mucho de qué va el libro, pero lo recomiendo 100% si te gustan las novelas negras. Las últimas 100 páginas fue como ir en un tren con todos estos personajes, no podía parar de leerlo mientras me acercaba al final. Sin duda un libro que se perfila en uno de los mejores que he leído este año 2015 :)"
1597,Alexandria,"If you're prone to anxiety, as I am, this one will give you a heart attack. I'd get to a particularly difficult part and have to put the book down and walk away for a few hours then return because I was so intrigued. Good stuff."
1598,Michele Coleman,A must read for suspense readers ! When I first started this book I wasn't sure if I'd like the format or style it was written in. It goes back and forth through the daily lives and thoughts of the main characters but it didn't take long to get caught up in it ! Rachel rides the commuter train in the morning and the evening daily. Along her route she watches the houses and the people who live within them making up stories about their lives. One day she notices a change at her favorite couples house which turns into a missing persons case. Rachel throws herself into the middle and along with her involvement with the house down the street leads us into a interesting and unexpected web of intrigue and lies.I could not put this one down and will be watching to see what Paula Hawkins will come out with next. Highly recommend for those who loved Gone Girl. 
1599,Jennifer Z,"Attention grabbing and hard to put down, but not surprised by endingThis book was a little slow to start, but it picked up pace and held my interest as the story began to unfold. It had some really screwed up characters, with some really sad issues. Unfortunately, there was no happy ending and to my dismay, I was able to predict exactly where things were headed. I would have preferred a little more of a shocker. But overall, a good book, wish it left me with a happier feeling."
1600,Kristofer,This was a fun and quick read. Very well-written too. Hope to read her again. Her storytelling is somewhat like Lianne Moriarty.
1601,Michelle Gehrz,Wow...what a ride! Lots of twists and twisted characters! A quick read because it is hard to put down. 
1602,Charlene,"Great who done it. had me guessing till the end. Reminded me of the book ""Sister"" by Rosamund Lupton."
1603,Katrina Harris,FABULOUS book - and a great ending I didn't even see coming - even though I knew that it was a twist! 
1604,Andi,"This book was awesome! I blew through it in 48 hours and could not put it down. The story was was told from 4 different view points and had many hooks and turns; all the way until the end. This book was said to be 2015's next ""Gone Girl"" & I couldn't agree more. I loved it & definitely recommend it. "
1605,Lynn,fabulous book!! Lots of comparisons made to Gone Girl... but I liked this one MUCH more. 
1606,Anh Gordon,"This was just good fun. It was intriguing until 1/3 into the book and then it drew me in and became very hard to put down. All the characters are very believable and there were twists and turns and bumps that were just very well done, I thought. Thoroughly enjoyable. "
1607,Vickie Becker,"This book was an tighter, faster moving, more interesting version of Gone Girl. I loved that book, I liked this one even more. Set just outside London, the author really captures the feeling and look of the area close to where my family lived for several years. The characters, like those of Gone Girl, are not sympathetic, but they are a bit more fleshed out. By the end of the book I was trying to turn pages before I'd finished reading and I was genuinely surprised by the reveal. If I had any criticism, it is that the moving viewpoints between the characters and difference in timelines can be a little confusing at times, but that is a small complaint. I highly recommend this book."
1608,Mrhoden04,"Loved it, just like Gone Girl. Addicted right away; easy reading."
1609,Ginny Ezell,"I could not put it down. I was disappointed when I saw the reviews compared it to ""Gone Girl"", but reading this book was so much better than my experience with ""Gone Girl"" (which I never finished). I read ""The Girl on the Train"" in one day! The twists and turns kept me having to reevaluate my theories and just when I thought I had it figured out, another twist! I Loved It! "
1610,Brigitta Moon,"The Girl On The Train is a book that sinks it's claws into you and holds on. As the story progresses it gets harder and harder to put down. The story is told from three different perspectives; three separate stories that seamlessly become one. The author's layout of scene and character descriptions is captivating. Sometimes Rachel is so absorbed in her self loathing that her reasoning for her actions sets you on edge because how could she make such idiotic decisions, be so naive. Three different women, three different personalities, all fooled. The ending was full of suspense, forcing me to read on until 2 A.M. when I finally finished. There were questions left unanswered like what about the cell phone and where was the followup to the case? I would recommend this book to anyone who loves an on the edge of your seat book."
1611,Heather Renshaw,Thoroughly enjoyed this book. I liked how you got to see things from 3 main characters perspectives throughout the book. Nice twist at the end. Very captivating. 
1612,Aritha,"A great page turner!Written in the style of ""Gone Girl"" , this story had you thinking that you knew who was the killer but only to change to another suspect. "
1613,Andrea Schoenbeck,This book kept you guessing throughout! It was intriguing to keep peeking into the different perspectives of the women as the story progressed. Very enjoyable to read! 
1614,Carole,I read this book very quickly - could not put it down! It's kind of like 'Gone Girl' but so MUCH BETTER!! 
1615,C.E. Allan,"I enjoyed this book a lot. The book kept me guessing until three quarters through the book. I slightly see why it is compared to Gone Girl, but I believe that was probably originally done for marketing the book."
1616,Julie Rivera,"This book was another 'can't-put-this-down' kinda book! I loved the way it switched narrators to give you different perspectives of the same situations. It kept me wondering and thinking, and while I suspected the outcome a little before it was revealed, I did wonder 'hmmmmmm, maybe not' until it was confirmed. This was a fantastic read for me."
1617,Yipin,"It’s been a while since I’ve felt so disturbed after reading a book. Haunting, yes. Definitely. The book is written in a few of the main characters’ point of view. Sort of like a journal. Just a mash up of entries by the characters. In the beginning, it feels tedious, lengthy, long winded, and wearisome and you start to wonder, how many ways can the same story be told? There were a few chapters where I was reading without actually bothering to make out what I was reading, because I felt that the story wasn’t progressing, it’s still telling the same tale from page one. But as I continue reading, I realised that the story has been developing and I suddenly lost track because I wasn’t concentrating, I wasn’t really reading it. I find myself flipping backwards to take note of the date in which each event is happening. In each chapter, you get a sliver of new information which you need to digest to fully grasp the full story. The chapters or “journal entries” were arranged not in chronical order, but in the order where you slowly get pieces of the puzzle to entice you to continue reading to the end where you can finally see the full picture; and when you do get to the end, your heart would be thumping. Traditional psychological thriller. The writing is good enough for you to imagine the scene, as if you're watching it. A little upset about the ending but it's not disappointing. Just upset for the characters and I wish I could do something for them. To help or to comfort them.For fans of Gone Girl definitely.How would I rate this book? 101% must read. "
1618,Susan Coster,"This was a riveting novel that kept me intrigued from start to finish. In brief, alcoholic Rachel, divorced and jobless, rides the train to London daily pretending she is still employed. As she passes the station she used to live with her ex, Tom, she spies on a neighbor, finally seeing her with a lover....when the woman is reported as missing, she contacts the police and becomes an integral part of the investigation and drama. A thriller! "
1619,Şeyma Aycibin,Okurken sonunu tahmin edemediğim bir kitap oldu..
1620,AMY,"WOW!! I usually don't like ""popular"" books or modern tales.. but this one was amazing. after i read it i told everyone i knew about it! my stepmom and sister also read it and loved it. i LOVED how fast-paced it was. her chapters are from different character's perspectives which i always love. She also seems to write so ""real"", i believed everything that was happening. and I can totally relate to seeing something every day and making up your own story in your head of how it is. i couldn't put this book down and I am not one of those readers who can read for hours at a time ( i get too sleepy). I think i finished this one in less than a week. and the TWISTS at the end, i never expected. LOVED IT! I will check out more books from this author."
1621,Amanda Pezzote,Read this in one sitting. Today. Nothing really productive happened this weekend...
1622,Kathryn Bernotavicius,This one kept me guessing until the last 30 or so pages! Great thriller!
1623,Hayley,"I've just finished reading this book and I feel like I need a lie down. Even though I had my suspicions about 'whodunnit' I think I was holding my breath with nerves for most of the last few chapters (and through quite a few of the earlier ones too). What a brilliant read, a proper thriller! This is going straight onto my favourites shelf and I reckon I can say, with certainty, that this book will be in my Top 10 reads of 2015 at the end of the year. "
1624,Ananda,"Originally posted on This Chick Reads*Copy provided by publisher in exchange for an honest review*OK, 'The Girl on the Train' is simply...WOW! I know you've heard a LOT about this book on social medias and I know for certain many of you are SO excited about this book, and here it is! The Girl on the Train is finally here and you have every right to be excited and not only that, you're totally allowed to run to the bookshop, grab a copy, and then run back home to devour this masterpiece of a thriller.Yeah, this book is THAT good! It's one of the most talked about books of 2015 and one of those hyped books but with a reason, trust me! It's Paula Hawkins debut, but it certainly doesn't feel like a debut. It's utterly fabulous, gripping, atmospheric read, which will make you wonder and question, and wonder some more.It starts with Rachel going on her regular commute, living a somewhat normal life, gazing though the train's window and observing people around her. Sometimes she even makes up stories around them, imagining their lives, what they had for tea, if they are happy, what are their names. Seeing them so often through the window makes her feel like she's already part of their lives, but at the same time in a bit of a bizarre way almost like a voyeur. However, some things happen, some things which will even make Rachel question her sanity, pulling her in a story where she's no longer an observer but taking an active role. And that's when things get really crazy and very very intense both for Rachel and the reader. The narrative is so flawless, so genuine, so captivating. Ms Hawkins' writing will make you think you're in Rachel's head or she's in your head..or both. One of the many qualities this book undoubtedly possesses is the fact it feels very real and even if you don't want to connect to Rachel (who's really messed up) in a strange, bizarre way you will care deeply for her and root for her. I said Rachel is messed up, and oh she is. She's still trying to get through her divorce and come to terms with the fact her (now) ex-husband moved on while she's still stuck. And there's alcohol involved, lots of it. At times I even wondered if some things really happened or they are just in Rachel's head, a product of her hangover or something. Which is point number TWO, why this book is so great. I don't think Ms Hawkins had the desire to create a character all of us will feel connected to, or some heartbroken 30ish woman with whom we could empathize. For many, Rachel could be even unlikable character, she's kind of weak, drained by all the misfortunes in her life and she has many flaws, the biggest being she's a heavy drinker. She's not strong enough to deal with her problem, despite the fact her flatmate is telling her she'll be forced to throw her out if she doesn't get her shit together. BUT, THE STORY, guys...it's that what matters. It really doesn't matter if Rachel was Ms Little Perfect or as f*cked up as she is, the story is what is important and that is making this book so great.Point number THREE, this book will make you think! Like, A LOT! Is everything what it seems, are we just mere observes of other people's lives, or we influence them to a certain extent? It also brings up the question, is the grass really greener on the other side? Will I be really happier if I were in Sue's shoes? Or what would happen if I was Jess, or Megan or whatever? And finally, when shit starts happening and we witness it, should we get involved or keep quiet? Though it seems sometimes we can avoid getting involved in some situations, most of the times we're simply caught up and we must do something about it. And as a rule, we're ALWAYS changed by these situations and the paths we choose to follow. And that, my dear friends, is what this book is about.As you see, I really really LOVED this book. I know my review will not do it justice, as I know comparing it to Gone Girl is...let's say, not very good as I certainly enjoyed and loved this book more than Gone Girl. I can see a connection mostly in two things, both are psychological thrillers and Gone Girl WAS and still is one of the most read thrillers and books lately, but this is where the similarity ends (at least for me). 'The Girl on the Train' DESERVES to stand on its own and not be compared to Gone Girl or any other book published before, simply because it's STRONG enough to stand on its own.I applaud to Ms Hawkins for creating this creepy yet beautiful, complex and layered story that will live with me forever. It's gripping and compelling read that you will read in one sitting, and though it's just January and it might be too early to say this, it's the IT book of 2015! Get ready guys, for you're about to go on a hell of a journey! Everyone, get aboard!"
1625,Onur Toktamış,"~MAY CONTAIN SPOILER~The storyline in this book is just like a spiderweb. It seems complicated -it indeed is- but once you see the pattern it contains, you just fall in love with the big picture. The characters are human, completely evil trying to hide - mostly successfully, but in the end masks fall and the real faces reveal. The author must have worked too hard to create such characters who are too alike each other yet so different."
1626,Antonia,"I thought it would be nice if I actually wrote a proper review for this, rather than 3 words.This book is extremely interesting. I was interested in the characters' lives along with the overall mystery.The main character, Rachel, is an alchoholic who always sees this couple from her seat on the train and kind of imagines what their perfect-looking life is like, until the woman in the couple goes missing, and Rachel becomes involved, and realizes that not everything is as perfect on the inside as it looks from the outside.Although Rachel made some questionable choices, and is a little bit of an anti-hero, I found her to be likable and her rage that she displays in certain parts of the book was understandable. She's really a mess and I'm happy I'm not dealing with a perfect character.There are also passages from the girl who goes missing leading up to her disappearance, making it much more interesting to try and figure out.This has a lot to do with darker subjects, this isn't a totally light book, and might not be for those people that don't like reading more depressing stories.I did figure out the ending a little bit before it was actually revealed, but that may have been done on purpous. Overall, it was one of those books that takes a lot of effort to put down. I'll totally be reading any other book this author writes."
1627,Rosalie,Sure did not guess the end. Very good read.
1628,Bill,"I started this book with some hesitation,concerned that it would be a rip off of Gone Girl. While there are some similarities (mainly the narrative coming from different characters' perspectives), it ended up being a real page turner. It was a little slow at the beginning getting traction, a quarter way thru I couldn't put it down. "
1629,David,"Voyeuristic mindfuck page-turner (lots of backwards page turning too--love that feeling: ""wait oh my god, how did she just say that. I thought... (flips backwards, re-reads) WHOA!""). These are not good people, they are not doing good things, but the author sure does make their collective story fascinating. Both the men and women are painted with awfully similar strokes of the brush, but their motivations are different enough to make them pop off the page. Hope you don't know too many people in your life like these folks... cuz if you do, you better watch yo back!"
1630,Summer ,"I found this book to be a fun read! I didn't want to stop reading it and found the character portrayal very realistic. Everyone is a mess, alcoholism described brilliantly, a new level of the ""crazy"" female who turns out to be the most sane. "
1631,Asni,"Saya menyukai buku ini karena karakter dari pemeran utama di buku ini. Penulis dapat menggambarkan karakter seorang wanita yang dihianati dan patah hati. Sehingga sebagai seorang wanita saya juga dapat merasakannya. Dengan alur cerita yang mengejutkan dan latar belakang sebuah kota kecil yang dilalui kereta, saya sangat menikmati membaca buku ini. Dan dalam watu dua hari saya bisa menyelesaikannya. Buku ini adalah buku psychological thriller terbaik yang pernah saya baca dan saya sangat merekomendasikan buku ini untuk dibaca. "
1632,Imani,Most twisted characters I've read about since Gone Girl. It's a on the edge of your seat page-turner. Can't get any better than that.
1633,Aaron Sta.Clara,"I can't get my head around the fact that there are people who actually hated this book! Some of them even labeled the characters in this book 'underdeveloped' but I tell you: they are so far from being correct. This is the first time that I greatly admired a book that is full of tragedies. The supreme writing of Paula Hawkins made me, a bachelor who's still earning his degree in Physics, to actually 'feel' the conflicting emotions of the characters. To me, they are real. They are breathing. They are not just some people who were just a product of pen or keyboard. They are alive! The alternate perspectives of the three women gave me a bird's eye view of what was happening. The writing was so smooth until the end and I think no words throughout the novel seemed misplaced. The plot was great and the revelation at the end was heart-pounding. Honestly, this is the kind of book that you will feel extreme pity to the characters. But it doesn't mean it makes it less great! Read it!"
1634,Emel,"This book it BRILLIANT!! It's everything Gone Girl should have been - great plot, excellent twists, enjoyable, not-in-the-least-bit-irritating narrative. There were moments when I held my breath, gasped out loud - SUCH a good read! I finished it in 2 days and cannot stop telling people how brilliant it is. Read it read it read it! (As a wise woman once said)"
1635,Keisha - thedawsonfamily4,I really enjoyed this book and had a hard time putting it down. There so many twists and turns that left me wanting more. The story took a turn that I didn't see coming.
1636,Taylor,"I picked this book up at Barnes and Noble on Sunday night, and I've been reading it compulsively since I started. I'm beginning to find that I enjoy adult novels more than I expected. I found it very unique the way the story is told. For starters, it is written similarly to a diary, but different in the way that its is told from the perspective of three different women, and the date of the events occurring are sporadic. Personally I found that the events in the story fall together beautifully. Around the middle of the novel, I started to think back on the quotes placed in the front of the book. I was curious to know why they were placed there and how they pertain to the story. Now, having finished the novel, I think of those quotes quite often. It's reassuring when I think of how clever it was of Hawkins to do that. However, the quotes themselves send a chill down my spine... I can't help but love it. Paula Hawkins is an amazing writer and I'm definitely going to be picking up another one of her novels in the near future! "
1637,Ron,"Like a train slowly pulling out of a station, the novel's pace begins in that fashion before reaching a dizzying breakneck speed with a compelling plot and exceptionally flawed and utterly engaging characters, all of whom are suspects and none of whom are truly innocent. The plot, however, is a mere driving force for the many disparate themes Hawkins explores (though I give her great credit for fooling me until near the very end, which most thrillers fail to do). The most fascinating character is Megan, who has the fewest chapters among the three women narrators as her story comes to a boil. She encapsulates the suburban ennui felt by all three characters, though she exercises far more agency in her attempt to escape the banality of modern life (Rachel becomes a victim and falls prey to alcoholism, while Anna uses a thrilling affair to enter into that boring life that she now desperately wants to protect). Megan's deep secret caused her too to create for herself this stultifying life, then succumbs to deep anger for this polite civility with irrational fears and neuroses--not least among them feeling a loss of control that comes from relying upon others--that can only be relieved by expressing sexual power over men (she very tellingly admits to desperate desires for her husband when he is away, an even more desperate desire to push him away when he is present).The tone is excellent, there are a few red herrings, and the ultimate resolution is satisfying, as Megan ultimately concludes that dismissal is worse than rejection. Isn't that always the way of those who create drama to relieve their boredom? "
1638,Lindsay Martin,"I want them to make this into a movie because I want everyone to enjoy this fast paced, whodunnit drama/thriller. I know, though, that if they turn it into a movie, it'll probably suck ass. So please don't ruin this fabulous book.It's a book about three women, each chapter told from their perspective: Alcoholic, unemployed, frumpy, barren, divorced Rachel; Anna, the beautiful mistress-turned-wife to Rachel's charming and handsome ex husband, living in Rachel and Tom's house, and mother to their child; Megan, the mysterious and beautiful young woman who lives down the street, married to Scott, a man she fears yet loves deeply, a former gallery owner with a closet filled with more skeletons than you could shake a stick at.One of them is murdered but by whom?This book is an intensely fast paced, well written, beautifully created book. You genuinely care for the characters in this book and wonder if you, yourself, are beginning to fall down the rabbit hole with one of the main characters. It took 8 hours to read this book and I didn't want to put it down."
1639,Kc Chapa,"Such a great book! I was all over the place trying to decide who the killer was. And I love the message that things aren't always what they seem. As humans, we are story tellers. So, it's so easy to check out a relationship or a person from far away and start telling ourselves these amazing stories about them...and then start to compare ourselves to this person, our relationship to this relationship. And, as always, I love characters that are multidimensional and complex. Man, the author really did an excellent job of setting the tone and atmosphere; like I really could feel the darkness, the depression, the bleakness of the spot Rachel was in. I hope she writes another book!"
1640,Roy,"Suspenseful and compelling. Just when you think you've met the most horrible person in the book, you're introduced to someone even worse. I loved hating these people! "
1641,Barb,"A very suspenseful and engaging bookI really enjoyed this book. It was engaging from the beginning , weaving the characters and their stories together. I feel that the pace picked up towards the middle of the book, and it was very difficult for me to put down. I liked the suspense, the ending wasn't predictable to me, and I really appreciated to fact that it had a definite ending, rather than leaving the reader hanging. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes a good, sometimes twisted story line. "
1642,Dorothy,"Shades of Gone Girl and Gaslight, this is one nifty page-turner of a thriller. Paula Hawkins has used the device of the unreliable narrative and lying narrator made famous by Gillian Flynn in her fantastically successful Gone Girl and used it with great ingenuity to tight and suspenseful effect. It was a very entertaining read.This is the story of three women - Rachel, Megan, and Anna. Each of the three shares in the narration of the story and so we see it from three different perspectives, but as we near the denouement, we begin to comprehend that none of the narratives has been entirely true. Certainly, none of the three is complete in itself.The woman who we first meet is that ""girl on the train."" She is Rachel. She takes the same commuter train to London every morning, allegedly to go to her job at a public relations firm. Only slowly is it revealed that she has actually lost her job because of her drinking three months before. She continues taking her daily trip to fool her flatmate whom she doesn't want to know about the job loss.As Rachel takes her daily trip to and from London, she rolls by a stretch of cozy suburban homes, one of which she used to live in with her husband, Tom. She was blissfully happy there until alcohol took over her life and Tom strayed into the arms of another woman, Anna. Now, he and Anna live in the house that he and Rachel once occupied and as she goes by each day, Rachel looks down on the house and remembers.She also observes a nearby house where a young couple, whom she has named Jason and Jess but who are actually Scott and Anna, live. Rachel sees them as happy and in love, the perfect young marrieds. The truth is very much more complicated than that, as we learn when we meet Megan through her narrative. One day as she is passing by, Rachel sees Jess (Megan) on her patio kissing another man who is not Jason (Scott) and she is shocked. Could she have been wrong about their lives?She is even more shocked when she reads in the newspaper that the woman who lived at that address has disappeared without a trace - the day after she saw her kissing a man not her husband. Is there a connection?While these events are happening, Rachel's life and her tentative hold on reality are unraveling completely. Her flatmate is fed up with her drinking and there is a black hole in her memory of the day that Megan disappeared. Rachel wakes the day after to find herself with unexplained injuries and unable to remember what happened, but she has a vague memory of being in the area where the woman disappeared.Then the woman's body is found near the railroad tracks and Rachel is even more desperate to remember what happened during her blackout. She fears that she may be somehow involved in Megan's death.Meanwhile, Anna is becoming fed up with Rachel and what she sees as her meddling in the lives of Anna, Tom, and their young daughter. She sees her as a stalker and a danger to her child.Rachel, in an alcoholic haze, is torn about what she observed of Megan from the train and what she thinks she knows about her life and that of Scott and the unknown man on the patio. When she finally works up her courage to tell the police, they at first accept and investigate her statement but then reach the conclusion that her observations are not to be trusted because she is a drunk. She is humiliated once again.This book has a lot of moving parts, but as we get near the end they all come together and take on the speed and force of a runaway locomotive. Paula Hawkins keeps all of the disparate lines of her complicated tale from becoming inextricably tangled and all the lies, innuendos, and threats eventually are revealed for what they are in a most satisfactory conclusion. It is a very impressive accomplishment."
1643,Emma Johnston,"Wow. Just wow. Words are lost to me at the moment. I'm having trouble processing exactly what went on in this book, the twists and turns that were both gripping and thrilling. The darkness of the story was at times so chilling that I had to just stop for a moment to process what I'd just read. I was captured by this story from the start although saying that about 3/4 of the way through the book I had guessed who had done it, but overall I loved it. Every single page was gripping and I'm so glad I picked it up! "
1644,Samantha Dewhurst,It's been a long time since I have sat and read a book in a day but wow this book gripped me!! The storyline was thrilling and exciting and I couldn't wait to finish it to get to the bottom of the murder. It is written in such a way that you feel you know about the story from so many points of view and this gives the reader quite a lot of understanding. The characters were great and the plot definatley kept me guessing. It was more intriguing that the main character Rachel didn't quite know what had happened in the said incident but knew she was connected. That made me want to know more about what happened that night and how she was connected. Such a page turner! Definately recommend this book to anyone looking for a thriller or novel to get stuck into! Couldn't put it down all day! 
1645,Katie,"Wow. What an incredible book. I had read over and over again that this book was much like Gone Girl, but the general consensus was that the book The Girl on the Train was much better. Having read Gone Girl and having really disliked certain elements of that book, I decided to give this book a try, and wow, I am so glad that I did.Rachel Watson's husband, Tom, has left her for another woman, Anna, and Rachel can't quite get over this. Everyday, she rides the train past the house they now share, but tries not to look at it and see their perfect life with their perfect marriage and their perfect baby girl. Instead, she focuses on another couple whom she's certain is perfect. She doesn't actually know the attractive couple who lives down the road from her ex, but she imagines names, histories, and lives for the pair. One day, however, she sees something horrifying that makes her rethink everything she thinks she knows about this couple. In the interconnected web that forms around Rachel, her ex, his new wife, and the mysterious couple, Hawkins creates a plot so thrilling that I couldn't stop reading from start to finish. I felt so many things through this book - discomfort, frustration, anxiety, hope - and a book that makes me feel quite so much is a book that I love. This is also a book that I have found myself recommending again and again. Just as everyone else had told me, this is a psychological thriller as the cover promises, and it is similar in ways to Gone Girl, but yes, it is SO MUCH BETTER."
1646,Shar,"I couldn't put this book down! I wont give an overview of the story - but I will say it is economically written - no over blown, flowery descriptions - the author only uses words that are necessary to move the story forward - it's rapid paced and tense and the ending does not disappoint. It has been a long time since I've read a contemporary book and felt satisfied with my purchase! I have heard it compared to Gone Girl - which I enjoyed but found the ending a little ridiculous - this is a head and shoulders above Gone Girl! "
1647,Lea Kocurek,So so so good! I read the majority in one day and couldn't put it down. Very interesting character study and I love the structure of the chapters. Incredibly gripping!
1648,Cindy Reeves,"This is a page-turner. I read it in two days. I agree that it is not quite Gone Girl, but a very entertaining mystery (even though I figured it out)."
1649,Anh Nguyen,"Truly a psychological thriller. You know you're hooked with the story when you look forward to the bus journey so you can read the book. I first saw the book at a hotel that we stayed in Hanoi. Some traveller must have left it there. I was hooked reading the first few pages. The book isn't a let down. It gives me the feel of Gone Girl so much, every character in the book has some kind of mental problem. Not gonna lie, I felt uneasy, on the verge of depression, during those days that i was reading the book. I felt frustrated, stuck, negative just as the main character. I think psychological thriller isn't doing me good, psychologically. But it is a darn thriller book. I didn't learn much from this book (aside the effect of alcohol and not to trust anyone), but it is a good book. I like the writing style, the pacing, the telling-a-story-from-different-viewpoints and the twist. It plays with your mind too. *Spoiler* You were so set on this person is the murderer or this person is absolutely innocent, until you find out it's the opposite. *Spoiler*"
1650,Jackie Wang,"""The Girl on the Train"" is one of my favorite books of all time. An instant classic and for good reason. As a diehard fan of psychological thrillers, this book was absolutely riveting, heart-breaking and completely took me by surprise. The cover is innocuous enough but within this book's pages lies some of the darkest yet most utterly human problems ever written. If you're a huge fan of ""Gone Girl"" (as I am), you'll love the pacing and plot line of this book.Rachel is one of the most flawed and unreliable narrators I've ever read, yet her plight is utterly realistic and highly sympathetic. The abuse she suffers under the hands of Tom and her self-abuse through alcoholism is maddening, yet we as readers can do nothing to help her. We watch her stumble through her blackouts, her addiction, her overwhelming loneliness and directionlessness...and we feel pity for her but at the same time fear that Rachel could really be any of us: she could be someone we know, someone we care about. She could be us - if we lost our jobs, our spouses, our home and our ability to have children.Meg and Scott are really just secondary characters but they still manage to be complex, living, breathing enigmas. Scott chills me to the core and Megan, sweet Megan, is so deluded and aimless. Megan in some ways is Rachel's character foil. Anna is also Rachel's character foil and despite thinking she's completely different from Rachel, they ultimately realize they are barreling down the same dead end, pining after a sociopath and an emotionally manipulative husband. The ending nearly ripped my heart out and I my jaw was unhinged the entire time. I did not expect it at all. The second half of this novel will definitely take on some plot twists you won't see coming. This book kept me up late into the night and even after I finished it, I was too scared to fall asleep. You know it's an amazing book when it keeps your mind spinning long after you've finished reading the last word.I am extremely keen to read whatever Paula Hawkins writes next. She is an amazing and talented author and this is a mind-blowing thriller I'd recommend to anyone. Can I rate this 10/5 stars??"
1651,Elf,"I'm a writer and I spend more than 12 hours in front of my computer writing, reading, and doing research. As you can imagine my eyes get too tired to add reading a lot of pages of a book at one sitting. Normally it takes weeks for me to finish a book of the length of The Girl on the Train. I finished The Girl on the Train in two afternoons. I really could not put it down. My eyes got tired, I felt dizzy from looking at my book, yet I kept reading to see what was coming next.I didn't know anything about the book before I began reading. All I knew was it was a thriller and that it was a bestseller. I do believe not knowing anything about the story made the story just more fun for me. Which is also why I'm not really reviewing the book's itself. If you haven't read anything about the book, don't do it now, just pass right to the book.Extra kudos to the author for keeping the length of the book what it is. When I read a thriller, very often I find myself thinking the author had added too many unnecessary details and that it would have been better if it was 50-150 pages shorter. The Girl on the Train was one of the rare thrillers that made me think, ""This is it. Not longer or shorter than it should be."" I will be surely getting the next book by Paula Hawkins."
1652,Philip Bailey,Ingenious. A rambling story about a pathetic alcoholic who can’t seem to get her life on track. Wasted days and nights as she struggles in vain to regain what she lost. But faded memories return amidst her moments of sobriety as images form to recreate a hellish scenario of death and deception. Eventually finding the pieces of the puzzle she sets about righting past wrongs and in so doing destroys part of that she sought to regain. A skillfully crafted plot keeps the reader in suspense. A superb work highly recommended. There is a reason books reach the top ten list and this book is an excellent example.
1653,Jorge Fimbres,"Once you start, you can't stop, the most cringe worthy but amazing, the turn of every event it's surprising. Highly recommended."
1654,Rute,"You see this book everywhere. It makes you think ""what's the fuss all about?"".I'll admit I was curious. I wanted to read it and find out if it really was that good.IT IS.IT IS THAT GOOD.EVEN BETTER, MAYBE.It fits exactly my definition of a good book. It's interesting, it surprised me, ... You can't put it down, you can't help it but read and read and keep Reading... The characters are flawed and you think ""I'm like that too"" or ""sometimes I feel the same thing"" or ""I would do exactly the same"".If you haven't read it yet, I don't know what you're doing with your life.Paula Hawkins, you understand people. Bless you!"
1655,Wendy T,I absolutely loved this book. This book kept me guessing right up the end. I totally didn't see this book end the way it did. I will be recommending this book to all my friends. Loved it!
1656,Ruth,"I thought this book was amazing. A book that everyone should read. At the beginning I wasn't all that interested but after getting to know the characters a little more, I was obsessed. You feel like you know the characters, each and every one of them are incredibly interesting with their own story. There are so many twist and turns in this book and the ending, was a surprising one. If your looking to get a book that you know you will enjoy, get this one. It could get a little depressing for some people but I thought it all wrapped up quite nicely. The book had pretty much everything I wanted out of it. It was a thriller, with romance, lust, talking about real problems, from lots of different perspectives. "
1657,Hilary Bermúdez,"Desde el principio supe que me iba a gustar. En el momento en que Rachel empezó haciendo su narración pude sentir esa tristeza y desesperación, y sí, es una borracha que no hace mucho por salir de su hueco, pero a mí me agradó. La vida tampoco la ha ayudado mucho que digamos.Pero dejando de lado el personaje principal, me encontré una trama que te mantiene pegado a las páginas. Tiene una narrativa poco complicada y las situaciones en las que se ven envueltos los personajes son atrapantes.Si bien es cierto, el gran misterio es predecible desde más o menos la mitad del libro ( o al menos hasta esa parte lo descubrí yo) quería seguir leyendo, ver cómo terminaba esa historia.Ahora, claro que es un poco (muy) extraña e irreal la manera en que Rachel se ve involucrada con ""Jess y Jason"" y eso es algo que no me termina de cuadrar bien con el libro. Pero aparte de esto, las emociones que me transmitían los personajes, los giros de la historia y el final, se merecen un cinco."
1658,Fede,"Sé que todo el mundo dice que no es un buen libro que es una mala copia de Gone Girl pero ¿a quien le importa?Me encantó, no puedo puntuar con menos de 5 estrellas. Es adictivo, intenso y con personajes muy bien logrados.Coincido en que el desenlace es un poco predecible pero fue un verdadero placer leer un final de 100 paginas.Excelente comienzo de lecturas para este 2016."
1659,Laurence Weinstein,"In the genre of Gone Girl with a terrifically tense ending but I liked Gone Girl better. The latter had more twists and turns and didn't have me gritting my teeth at the girl (Rachel) on the train (hence the book title) who just couldn't help herself getting in deeper and deeper. ""I know I shouldn't do this but . . . "" became an annoying refrain."
1660,Ambahr Morales-Cuevas,"This book is really interesting if you like stories with a little more sexual feelings and crime novels. When I first read this book, I wasn't sure I liked it, but as it progressed a little more, I was enjoying it with the fact that it was different point of views. It had different characters which had their own problems, but what I liked about it, is that all of them interacted some way. One of the characters would be connected to another and another in a way I did not see coming. I really recommend this! :)"
1661,Stacy Cook," Yes, this is another ringing endorsement for The Girl On the Train and yes, I can see the similarities to Gone Girl, but I think this book wins out!. While I read Gone Girl in a shorter period of time the reason it took me longer to read The Girl On the Train was because I kept picking it up, reading a few pages, then I would close the book because I was afraid I would get to the end too quickly and it would all be over! I love that about this book! The only reason I made myself finish it at all (because I never wanted it to end) was that I read on the internet that it was being made into a movie and I can't wait for that experience (so basically I had something to look forward to when the book ended)! I should include a few more specifics as to what I enjoyed so much about the book, so here goes: It was incredibly fast paced and kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time! While like some other reviewers I did guess the outcome, it wasn't until much later in the book for me because of all the red herrings, secrets and character back-stories the author continued to throw in. The book was very relatable to me at this time as I myself have just started taking public transportation; although, the bus and not the train like the main character Rachel does and I often find myself making up stories in my head of people I see on the street as I pass by. Rachel is an alcoholic who rides the train daily on her way back and forth to a job she no longer has due to her drinking. On this train ride she passes the houses of Megan and Anna, the other central characters. The story is told alternately through their eyes. Again, while there are some similarities to Gone Girl, I feel this book stands on its own as an engaging psychological thriller, so go pick it up!"
1662,Kitty,A riveting mystery set in current day London. I was mesmerized. 
1663,Megan,"I devoured this book in 24 hours, it was gripping. It made me nervous and jumpy because I wanted to know what happened. The chapters rotate between three characters, each with their own flaws and self destructive behavior. At times I was frustrated with the main character Rachel, wanting to shake her out of her alcoholic, self destructive spiral. It is British book, that comes with a writing style that I often find in British literature, not bad, but different from Americain literature. I find that a lot if English movies and books can be a bit depressingly, now this is a gross over generalization, I know. It's not that I don't enjoy them, I just have to be in the right mindset.I did love this book, like Gone Girl, it had a darker path, a thriller through and through."
1664,Jen Schneider,I loved this book! I couldn't put it down! I highly recommend reading it. 
1665,Doan,Okay...I let my kids go hungry so I could finish this book. Craziness!!!
1666,Laura Agnella,"The Girl on the Train was the first book I read for the Beat the Heat Readathon and I picked it up because so many people have said how fabulous it is. I now agree. What a roller coaster ride! The story was completely engrossing right from the beginning and I couldn't put it down. The main character, Rachel, was painted perfectly as a woman who was at her lowest and just couldn't seem to move on and let go of her past. She was truly pathetic at this time in her life; making such terrible decisions that I would cringe, and yet at the same time, I found myself secretly hoping that she would break free from her torment and begin the journey back to normalcy.As you move further into the story, the plot thickens and the dramatic intensity increases significantly. Once I got to the final third of the book, I knew I wouldn't be stopping until I finished and there was no guessing what the end would have in store until you were almost on top of it. The possibilities as I read seemed endless and once the mystery was introduced, I found myself jotting down all of my theories and then crossing them out as I came upon something to lead me in another direction or change my thinking. When I finally had my ""Aha!"" moment, I was pretty close to the end. It was very well written and I'm looking forward to reading other books by this author. I will definitely be adding The Girl on the Train to my top ten for 2015."
1667,Barb Johnson,Great readFinally a mystery I didn't figure out until the author wanted me to. Loved this. Would love to see Rachel find true happiness 
1668,Nadine,"4,5 Sterne"
1669,Colleen Oakes,"Like a freight train hurtling towards the open track, so I plowed my way through this brilliant, heart-pounding gem of a thriller. I can't say enough good things about this book - the characterization? Perfection. I can't remember the last time I read such a good portrayal of the unreliable narrator - oh yes I can, it's Gone Girl. I loved Rachel and all her miserable addictions - the alcohol, the train, her ex. This was a book about damaged women, and it didn't flinch the way so many do when it comes to portraying women as anything less than a shining, perfect ideal. I've read a lot of great books this year, and this takes it's rank at the top of the list."
1670,Aurora Molitoris,"I could barely put this book down. I found it to be better written than Gone Girl, and quite a bit more enjoyable to read. Rachel has hit rough times-she is an alcoholic, is unemployed and divorced. She feels apathetic about her life, until one day when she witnesses something from the train...."
1671,Katie Kenig,"“Beautiful sunshine, cloudless skies, no one to play with, nothing to do. Living like this, the way I’m living at the moment, is harder in the summer when there is so much daylight, so little cover of darkness, when everyone is out and about, being flagrantly, aggressively happy. It’s exhausting, and it makes you feel bad if you’re not joining in.” OMG I loved, loved, loved, loved, loved this book!!!I have been vigorously enthusing about this book since I finished it. I love mystery/suspense/thrillers. But usually I have most of the mystery figured out before I even hit halfway in. Not here. I was suspicious of everyone at some point. You just can't trust anyone here, and it's glorious.It's beautifully written, and that is rare for me to say for books written in first person. I usually find them harder to relate to, but not here. The book takes place inside of the brains of three different women, and I genuinely felt as though I was inside of each of them. They are all relatable in their own ways, all real, all dangerous and suspicious, all in danger and frail. Wow. What a ride.Oh, I know, I said that already. But it bears saying again. Honestly.“Hollowness: that I understand. I'm starting to believe that there isn't anything you can do to fix it. That's what I've taken from the therapy sessions: the holes in your life are permanent. You have to grow around them, like tree roots around concrete; you mold yourself through the gaps”Rachel rides the train every day. It stops at a signal in her own neighborhood. She can see the house where she lived with her ex-husband - where he now lives with his new wife and daughter. And a few doors down, she can see the house of a happy young couple that often have coffee on a back veranda. She makes up stories in her head about the couple, fantasizing their happy life since her own is gone. “There’s something comforting about the sight of strangers safe at home.” “And they are a partnership. I can see it, I know how they are. His strength, that protectiveness he radiates, it doesn’t mean she’s weak. She’s strong in other ways; she makes intellectual leaps that leave him open mouthed in admiration. She can cut to the nub of a problem, dissect and analyse it in the time it takes other people to say good morning. At parties, he often holds her hand, even though they’ve been together years. They respect each other, they don’t put each other down.” One day, the female half of the couple is gone. And the next, Rachel discovers she's been reported missing. Was what she's seen from the train something that could help solve the disappearance?Anna is married to Tom, who used to be married to Rachel. She was the other woman, before she lived in this house, and kind of liked it better that way.“Being the other woman is a huge turn-on, there’s no point denying it: you’re the one he can’t help but betray his wife for, even though he loves her. That’s just how irresistible you are.” She watches the trains go by, hating them. She hates Rachel too, who seems to be constantly in their lives.“let’s be honest: women are still only really valued for two things—their looks and their role as mothers.”Megan is a wife to Scott, and they sit on their veranda to sip coffee and watch the trains. But Megan is feeling stifled in her suburban life, and their happiness is not exactly what it seems.“But I have to do something, and at least this feels like action. All those plans I had—photography courses and cookery classes—when it comes down to it, they feel a bit pointless, as if I’m playing at real life instead of actually living it. I need to find something that I must do, something undeniable. I can’t do this, I can’t just be a wife. I don’t understand how anyone does it—there is literally nothing to do but wait. Wait for a man to come home and love you. Either that or look around for something to distract you.” I love these women. I love their stories. I cheered for them and cried for them and felt deeply in my heart for them. I saw parts of myself reflected in each of them. Some in sad and scary ways.“When did you become so weak?” I don’t know. I don’t know where that strength went, I don’t remember losing it. I think that over time it got chipped away, bit by bit, by life, by the living of it.”I also thought the writing here was just beautiful. That's not something I often find in mysteries/thrillers - passages so lovely that I go back to re-read them just for the sheer pleasure of it. “It feels like coming home - not just to any home, but a childhood home, a place left behind a lifetime ago; it's the familiarity of walking up stairs and knowing exactly which one is going to creak.” It's simple but poetic and speaks right to the heart of me. I highly recommend this book. It's absolutely wonderful."
1672,Taaron,Well written and bitterly sad!
1673,Noll,"Thrillers aren't my usual fare, so they have to be pretty gripping to reel me in. The last time I recall tearing through a thriller as quickly as this one was when I read ""Derailed"" by James Siegel. Coincidentally both involve trains! As soon as I read the premise for ""The Girl On The Train"" I had to read it. I myself am a people-watcher, though maybe not quite so invested in the lives of specific strangers as Rachel is in the lives of 'Jess' and 'Jason'.There was nothing I didn't enjoy about this book. None of the characters were particularly likeable, but all were compelling enough to read about, which is not an easy thing to achieve. Although, I didn't dislike Rachel. I found myself relating uncomfortably to her endless good intentions for a fresh start tomorrow, knowing tomorrow is always a day away. I can see why people might pity or despise her, much in the way they do in the novel, but honestly I just felt empathetic. I wanted something to go right for her, and completely understood her compulsion to unravel the mystery she finds herself tangled up in.The narrative jumps around, temporally and from one viewpoint to another, and often such books lose me so entirely that I give up any semblance of understanding what's occuring. This book, however, covered quite a short span of time in two separate years, and each viewpoint was distinct enough to create distinct jigsaw pieces which slotted together perfectly. I had five ideas about whodunnit, all of which were wrong, and on three separate occasions I thought 'this reads like an ending, what more can happen?!' An easy read, a complex but not over-complicated, and certainly not unbelieveable, plot, and while it probably doesn't *quite* deserve five stars (not entirely sure about that scene at the end), it definitely left me satisfied enough to award them."
1674,Susan Callaway,"The Girl on the Train opens with Rachel (the title character) riding the commuter train and ruminating on the current state of her life. It isn't long before the reader becomes aware that Rachel is divorced, unemployed, and an alcoholic, and that her marriage and job both ended as a result of her drinking. Rachel pretends to go to work, so her flatmate won't find out that she's lost her job.Rachel mourns the end of her relationship with ex Tom and is unable to move on, even though Tom--who is already remarried with a young daughter--clearly resents her intrusions on his new life. To help herself cope with her feelings, Rachel makes a study of a young couple as the train passes their terrace. ""Jason"" and ""Jess"" are a perfect couple, blissfully in love. A few houses down, Tom lives with his new wife, Anna, and their infant daughter--in the house Rachel once shared with Tom.Rachel's life is messy and unhappy. She drinks to the point of blacking out and continues to make horrible, damaging decisions during these blackouts. While she acknowledges to herself that her drinking is ruining her life, she cannot stop. Then Rachel realizes that something horrifying happened while she was drunk--she wakes up at home cut and bleeding from her head--and Tom is upset with her. Rachel can't remember anything. Something else happened the same night, something involving a beautiful young woman named Megan.But Rachel knows her as Jess.The Girl on the Train is a riveting and suspenseful look at the inner workings of marriage and the ugly secrets that can lie beneath the facade of marital bliss. Rachel is depicted as a pathetic, drunken, aging woman who cannot let go of her ex and has no control over her own life. She's not particularly likable and there's nothing to admire about her. Although she is an unreliable narrator, Rachel's raw, unflinching honesty with herself and her earnest desire to help ""Jason"" (who is really Scott) made me care about her. I felt I could understand her anguish and heartbreak.The story-telling and pacing were well-done and the characters were mostly well-developed. They are complex people who seem real. The one exception is Anna who I felt was poorly developed."
1675,Amanda D,"Everyone is saying that this book is the next ""Gone Girl"" & after reading the book I understand the comparison. It is a completely different story but the way it kept me turning the pages well into the early morning hours definitely made the long tiring day at work the next day worth it. Even after I finished the book I couldn't stop thinking about how it all turned out. Only a great book has that effect on me. Would definitely recommend. 5 stars on goodreads & will be getting another 5 stars at my book club meeting next month.Well done Paula Hawkins, great story & can not wait to read more from this author."
1676,Eka Herlyanti,"Aku suka banget sama gaya bercerita Paula. Dia pinter banget bikin aku betah membuka halaman demi halaman dan terbius dengan ceritanya. Dan melebihi semua itu, aku sukaaaaa banget sama endingnya. Gak cuma jago di narasi dan deskripsi, Paula juga jago bikin aku terkecoh beberapa kali. Malah, mendekati akhir cerita, meski dugaanku kuat kalo dialah pelakunya, aku rela membuka kembali bab-bab Megan sebelumnya demi mencocokkan dan menguatkan dugaanku. Berasa jadi detektif beneran nih hehehe.Mmm, kalo soal ketegangan, menurutku terbilang lambat datangnya. Kenapa? Karena di awal-awal aku merasa genre dramanya begitu kuat. Itu sih pendapatku. Yah, sama kayak The Cuckoo's Calling gitu, tapi rasanya novel ini jauh lebih baik. Dari segi pengolahan jalan cerita, misteri, dan pengungkapannya. Lebih bikin penasaran dan masuk akal. Pokoknya, narasi dan deskripsi Paula adalah segalanya yang bikin aku betah baca buku ini. Eng, ada dua benda dalam bab awal novel ini yang rasanya gak berguna, cuman jadi hiasan dan gak pernah disebut-sebut lagi dalam pengungkapan fakta. Sekiranya begitu. Atau apa aku memang lupa ya??? "
1677,Sarah Humphrey,This book was awesome!! It took a couple chapters but...OMG!!!
1678,Tommy,"A journey into crazy. . . At first I was impatient with the three main protagonists, until the reasons for their behavior started to be revealed, and then I was completely hooked. I was obsessed with the story until I could reach the end, and now I'm missing the world of those characters. Just the kind of book I love!"
1679,Sarah Smith,Read this in 48 hours. I couldn't put it down. And I'll be sleeping with the lights on tonight. 
1680,Chrissy♥Dev ,"image: [image error]This book reminds me of why i started read and why I fell in love with literature. As muh as you try to put this novel down you cant until you know 'who done it'. The book revolves around three whose lives are interwined and a mysterious black out that holds the key to everything. Just when I thought I might know who the killer was my mind drives me into a different direction. A great book, for those who love a good mystery and thriller."
1681,Mindy Cheah,"To be really honest, I hesitated when I selected this book to read. I was not exactly sure of what to expect. Anyway, from the beginning to probably before Rachel found out who killed Meghan, it was really difficult for me to like Rachel. She knows she is a drunk and keeps trying to be better, to stop drinking and she is always so weak! So many times I resisted the urge to yell 'Oh, come on!'. I love the story and the ending. I also agree that it is somewhat darker than 'Gone Girl'. Worth reading!"
1682,Patricia Kisamore,soooooo good!!!!!
1683,Dixie,"Another book I found on the top seller lists that I thought I'd like to read. It was hard to put down! It sucks you in right away. It's narrated by the three different women in the story, from their point of view.Rachel, who was married to Tom. She's now bitter, angry & an alcoholic, riding the commuter train and inventing stories of the people she sees at the train stops, in her old neighborhood. Anna, who is now married to Tom has a child Rachel was unable have with him. The neighbor lady Megan, who is married to Scott, who has turned up missing. "
1684,Jeff,"Okay, interesting back story on how I came upon The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins. I really didn't pay any intention to this book before I started noticing insane numbers on the hold list for this book. A good example is The Philadelphia Free Library which has, as I write this review, 1172 patrons on the hold list for it.It was then I remembered getting a copy of it when it first came out and, like The Other Typist and A Pleasure and a Calling, wasn't sure I'd ever get around to reading it, but when I started seeing these numbers and then reading the reviews and noticed that it was on top of the NYT best seller list and the fasting selling adult book in history, I jumped on it.Let me start by saying that we finally have a worthy successor to Patricia Highsmith. If your a fan of Highsmith's and have been waiting for another writer with her style, you'll have to wait no longer. The story itself is pure Highsmith even down to the story begining on a train and with characters worthy of Tom Ripley and Chester MacFarland. It turns the unreliable narration on its head.It's been 20 years since Highsmith's death and, if you've been waiting that long for this novel, it needs to your next read. Even if you've never read her and you liked Gone Girl, you'll love The Girl on the Train."
1685,Sook,"Yes I binge read this book today... The boys and I were all sick so we stayed home today so I decided to pick up a book to read... And I ended up reading the whole book in a few hours... It is a psychological thriller. A girl in a suburb neighborhood goes missing and her body turns up not long after... And since I'm usually good at guessing who the killers are in books and TV shows (haha), I guessed the killer right away and I turned out to be right... But I must admit I doubted my guess several times throughout the book. So I wasn't really disappointed with how things turned out. But the real big twist is on the very last page of the book! I did not see that coming which is why I bumped the rating from four to five stars! I got goosebumps when I finished the book! One thing to note is that none of the characters in this book are perfect. They have many weaknesses and are not very likable at times. At times I felt the victim kind of deserved what she got. But I was still fascinated by how crazy and flawed they all were, too. (Except maybe Rachel's flatmate, Cathy) And honestly made me feel better about myself haha"
1686,Hannah Read,"I bought this book the week it came out, and I'd never heard of the author before. This is her first thriller book, and so I wasn't expecting it to be brilliant. I think, however, that I was wrong.'The Girl On The Train' is a fast-paced thriller following the alcoholic Rachel (and some other characters) and her journeys on the train each morning. One day, she witnesses something that means that everything has changed, and she becomes involved in a dramatic situation where the reader is constantly guessing what is going to happen next. Generally, when I am reading a thriller, I don't find it too hard to work out what is going to happen, or at least where it is going. When reading this though, I found myself unable to guess properly because there were so many clever twists in it. Paula Hawkins appears to be very good at masking certain elements within the story, which makes the path it takes even more interesting.I found the writing style very easy to read, as it was written nicely and in quite a modern style, but it was very hard to read at the same time - there a lot of emotions within the book, and certain scenes can be quite traumatic. I found myself welling up on public transport quite frequently from the raw sadness of the characters, or gripping the book tight due to the element of suspense. Once I was in the story it was impossible to get away from it - even after putting it away I would still find myself thinking about it afterwards. I found the characters incredibly interesting, and their lives were intricate and complex, making them intriguing to read about. I was also very satisfied with the ending, which again is rare for me. What I enjoyed most about the book was its pace - it was very fast-paced, in that it was an involved thriller where a lot of things happened and a lot of concepts had to be realised very quickly. There was a lot of rushing about and at parts I found myself racing through the book, eager to see what would happen. Despite this, it was also very slow-paced, and Paula Hawkins had got the balance of the two just right. The book involves a lot of introspection (something I really like in a story) and allows you a lot of access into the characters' minds, even if they don't necessarily reveal everything straight away. We see the thoughts and perspectives of several different characters, which makes it quite hard to keep up with, but it also means that we are putting the jigsaw together ourselves - constantly scrambling for information and trying to put together different scenes and judgements.I would one hundred percent recommend this book to anyone looking for a good thriller. I'm impressed that the author has done so well considering she has not written a thriller before, and I think everyone needs to read it just to experience the emotions that she has so well put across in it. My advice - go buy this book!"
1687,Holly Freudenberger Kitchens,I loved this book!! 
1688,Helen Katz,Just SO SO good!!
1689,Jae Werndli,"Wow. fast paced, twisting plot- great read! Similar style to Gone Girl. Read this book. "
1690,AnneMarie,Went by SO FAST and while slightly predictable at the end I really enjoyed racing through this. One of those books you want to stay up later for and read more.
1691,Emily Morrell,Couldn't put this book down!! 
1692,Kerry Ognenoff,I loved this book! Couldn't put it down. The different viewpoints and timelines used to tell the story provided the perfect amount of suspense and mystery. Just as twisty and almost as dark as Gone Girl.
1693,Ellen,"In the genre of Gone Girl, you will not be able to put the book down through all the twists and turns. Told in the alternating voices of Rachel, the alcoholic ex wife, Anna, the current wife, and Megan, the murder victim, the suspense of all that happens starts with Rachel and the stories she attributes to people she watches from the morning train. Not my usual read, but excellently done."
1694,Ken Bour,"I started this book on the evening of 29 Dec and finished it the next day - a first for me in years! The story-telling was so vivid and compelling, I simply could not stop flipping pages one chapter after another... To be sure, this is not an uplifting saga, which appears to have caused some reviewers personal uneasiness and displeasure. It is a deep psychological dive into the seediness and wretchedness of certain human proclivities including, but not limited to, obsession, possession, aggrandizement, exploitation, and victimization. All of the main characters are flawed in one way or another although at least two, through introspection, courage, and bravery, find a modicum of salvation in the end. Paula Hawkins does a masterful job of unveiling the intertwined lives of a half dozen morally impaired men and women through various adulterous, debaucherous, deceitful, and destructive behaviors. The story is as sickening as it is gripping and - perhaps - that is one of Hawkins' implied messages: like Rachel, some of us are, indeed, ""rubberneckers"" who want to be involved and cannot turn away from the sleazy and sordid aspects of humanity even though, paradoxically, we espouse them to be despicable, shameful, and deplorable. "
1695,Coni Warren,"This book first gripped me when it was slowly revealed how bad of a drinking addiction Rachel had. Her life is in shambles to what it once was, and she blames herself and her drinking for most of it. She wishes she was still married to Tom, but knows it is all her fault. She leaves him drunken voicemails or calls his house late at night, but does not always remember what she says. I would smack my face on Rachel’s behalf when she would wake up the next morning and realize what horrible decision she had made the night before when she was blacked out. I would cheer each time I thought she was staying sober for a few days, and then she would fall off the wagon again and make another bad choice. It was like watching a car accident where you can’t look away, even though you know you should.In this case, you should keep looking since there is more to the story than her being a sad drunk. This is what I loved about the story. I felt for Rachel, even though there was so much not to feel for her. She is a character that could be easily shunned and looked down upon, but I wanted there to be more to her. I felt there was at the end of the book. While I loved reading the other two characters’ perspectives, I always wanted to go back to Rachel to move her story along, even when it seemed really pathetic. The overall mystery is a good one, even though it is sad in how it affected so many different people in the story. I don’t know if it was a happy ending, but a satisfying one."
1696,Fadra Nally,"I loved this book in so many ways. While the ending seemed a little ""Lifetime movie""ish, the characters had so much depth and soul. It gives tough topics like divorce, infertility, infidelity, and alcoholism a whole new perspective. If reading the book has left you feeling flat, listen to the audiobook. It's amazing. "
1697,Mariazita,"Um livro fantástico, arrepiante, absorvente.Contado por três personagens, que vão interligando as narrativas, que se não estivermos bem atentos podrão levar em erro, porque neste livro nada é o que parece.Parece que estamos vivendo num universo de loucos . em que nada pode ser possível e de repente somos supreendidos e tudo de repente encaixa na perfeição e é ai que este livro é fabuloso.Adorei ler, um dos melhores livros do género que li até agora e consegui ler num só dia, pois é dificil largar a sua leitura sem chegar ao fim rapidamente."
1698,Maerhys,"I grabbed THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN from Audible on its release day because the summary appealed to me. It's a debut from British former journalist and if the rest of her books are this good, she will be on my auto-buy list forever. Excellent momentum of the plot alongside even better characterization, and damn these characters came alive. I didn't guess the ending so much as I was hoping against hope (view spoiler)[because I hated Tom from his introduction and I knew he had to be a villain above and beyond his adultery - the ending would have only been better had Anna also been involved but she shows her true colors from the first page so there was not going to be any real reveal about her (hide spoiler)] and I was rewarded. I suspected that Hawkings may (view spoiler)[have made Rachel pregnant from the one-night stand with Scott (hide spoiler)] and I am beyond happy that she didn't go in that direction. A really, really wonderful read and it more than lives up the hype I've since discovered about it."
1699,Bilyana,"That was such an addictive read! And I read it on the train! No G&T though. A few strong messages in the book - the consequences of abusive relationships, alcoholism and poisonous secrets. I suppose these are repeatedly used in this genre but I also liked the style of writing - had me flipping pages back to do my own investigation."
1700,Booksy Galore,"Yes, it's been compared to Gone Girl but I think this is a far superior book. There is a similar mystery/thriller aspect to it and the ""unreliable"" narrator angle. However, the literary skill of the author in describing the physical and emotional world of the protagonist as well as a deft hand at revealing the depth of the characters and their motivations makes this a far more satisfying and well-written book on many levels. "
1701,Kim McGee,"Rachel's life is complicated - she has hit near bottom since the breakup of her marriage, when the excuses began and the drinking got worse and she was fired. Her flawed personality can't quite let the guilt go so she spends each day traveling on the commuter train she used to travel each day before her life went off the rails. As she does she makes up a life about the couple she sees from the train stop until one day when she sees something she shouldn't. Her life spirals into desperation and confusion about the couple and the very real bad thing she thinks she saw. The couple have ties to her old life so as the book unfolds we will begin to piece together what happened and Rachel's part in it. Paula Hawkins gives us the perfect game of cat and mouse as told by the women in the story. You won't know who to trust, you won't know what is happening and you won't see it coming until it hits you in the face. There are so few books that you want to drop everything you are doing to finish and this is one of them. My thanks to the publisher for the advance copy of what is sure to be a runaway best seller."

Adunând toate situațiile descrise, creăm spre sfârșitul lecturii o imagine a unui puzzle la care nici nu ne puteam imagina.Autoarea  Paula Hawkins are un talent remarcabil în felul în care învăluie cu mister și suspans momentele din carte.

Bănuiesc că trebuie să fie defect, pentru că aproape întotdeauna lumina aceea e roșie; ne oprim în punctul ăsta în majoritatea zilelor, uneori pentru câteva secunde, alteori minute în șir. Dacă stau în vagonul D, cum fac de obicei, și trenul oprește exact în dreptul acestui semnal, ca aproape de fiecare dată, am un punct de observație perfect pentru casa mea favorită de pe traseu: cea de la numărul cincisprezece.""""Cum suntem blocați la semnalul roșu, îi caut cu privirea. Jess e de obicei afară dimineața, mai ales vara, bându-și cafeaua. Câteodată, când o văd acolo, am sentimentul că și ea mă vede, că se uită direct la mine și-mi vine să-i fac cu mâna, Dar sunt mult prea timidă. Pe Jason nu-l văd foarte des, e plecat la muncă de cele mai multe ori. Dar chiar dacă nu sunt acolo, mă gândesc la ei, la ce fac, la ce pun la cale. Poate că azi e ziua lor liberă și ea e în pat, în timp ce el pregătește micul dejun, sau poate că au plecat amândoi să alerge, pentru că sunt lucruri care le fac ei de obicei. [...] Poate că Jess e acum în camera de oaspeți și pictează sau poate că sunt amândoi la duș, ea cu palmele sprijinite de faianță, el cu mâinile pe șoldurile ei.""""Pe unul din pereți, cineva a scris: VIAȚA NU E UN PARAGRAF.""""Nu știu nici cum îi cheamă, așa că a trebuit să-i botez eu. Jason, pentru că e un bărbat bine, în stilul starurilor de film britanic, nu în stilul unui Depp sau Pitt, ci a lui Firth sau Jason Isaacs. Iar numele de Jess se potrivește cu Jason și cu femeia în sine. I se potrivește mănușă, așa frumoasă și lipsită de griji cum pare. Sunt o pereche, un set. Sunt fericiți, pot spune. Sunt așa cum eram și eu; sunt ca mine și Tom, cum eram noi acum cinci ani. Ei sunt tot ce eu am pierdut, sunt tot ceea ce eu îmi doresc să fiu.""""Mă urmează, iar eu îmi scot hainele de pe mine în timp ce urc scările și când ajungem în dormitor, când mă împinge pe pat, nici măcar nu mă gândesc la el, dar nu contează pentru că el nu știe asta. Sunt suficient de bună încât să-l fac să creadă că numai pe el îl am în minte.""""În tren, lacrimile încep să-mi curgă pe obraz și nu-mi pasă că oamenii se uită la mine; ar putea să creadă orice - că a dat o mașină peste câinile meu sau că tocmai am fost diagnosticată cu o boală incurabilă. Sau că sunt o alcoolică stearpă, divorțată și în curând aruncată pe drumuri.""""Eram în bibliotecă, pe Theobalds Road. Tocmai îî trimisese un e-mai mamei, de pe contul meu de Yahoo!

1703,Rich P,"A great, old-fashioned thrillerThe real shame is that Alfred Hitchcock is dead and therefore unable to film this book. It echoes some of his classics - you will find touches of ""Rear Window,"" ""Spellbound,"" and ""Suspicion,"" mixed with a heavy dollop of a famous non-Hitchcock work, ""Gaslight.""Other reviewers have given summaries, so I won't attempt to do it here; I would be too afraid to leave potential spoilers. All I can say to those idly picking it up is to stay with it: for quite a few pages I just wasn't, as they say, ""feeling it."" Suddenly it snapped on me like a mousetrap and I couldn't escape its grasp. "
1704,Debbie Davies,"Well written. I really enjoyed this novel. While I thought it was predictable, I couldn't put it down. Please keep writing ms. Hawkins and I will definitely keep reading."
1705,Cristina Rose,"4.8***It took me 3 days to finish this book and I couldnt/didnt want to put it down Holy @*&^ What an amazing book, I definitely didn't piece the puzzle until more than halfway in, Was (initially) at first bored with Anna but thankfully she was redeemed as a character, Notable characters: Megan & Kamal, oddest: Scott & Anna. Rache was entertaining although unreliable at times but her interest driven by boredom or psychological reasons to be determined. This was a very psychologically entertaining novelOf course no one in this novel is remotely likable except for maybe Cathy, however I liked the melange of neuroses because it kept me guessing. Although I haven't read Gone Girl yet, (next on my list) I like that The Girl On the Train goes deep into the psyche of human nature. Folks, life isn't pretty but in this fictional tale of betrayal, murder, psychology, & addiction - its sure to linger and make you analyze and I'm 100% okay with that POSSIBLE SPOILERS****two things i felt somewhat conflicted about, the ending - well the aftermath I wanted it a little longer and maybe differentScott's motives, was he just a narcissistic? Why did he just remove himself? We get one's fate but his remains a mystery on a psychological level "
1706,Sierra,"Gone Girl was amazing, but it's beginning to become like The Fault in Our Stars and The Hunger Games. STOP COMPARING BOOKS TO THEM, PLEASE. Love books separately. I get like, if you were a fan of this, you might be a fan of this. But yes... I dunno.Anyway, loved it! It was quick, and I absolutely loved Paula Hawkins' writing.2015 READING CHALLENGE: A book with a love triangle"
1707,Linda,Amazing!!! 
1708,Steffi ♥,"until the very end I did not expect that the person, who committed the hijacking, as the perpetrator..."
1709,Ramona,"Love. love love this book !!It's one of the best books I have EVER read... was on the edge of my seat ..or bed reading it....Just couldn't work out who was the one that was the craziest...it is superbly written and if you didn't like crime and mystery before , I promise you will after reading this book!Very rich characters, Rachel, Anna and Megan... You are sort of wanting Rachel to get it together and pull herself out of her slump but as you read it you begin to really feel for her, I can't give the story away but I promise you , you won't be bored...10 out of 10 for this"
1710,Sue Lyle,"This book is a page turner and a carefully crafted thriller that is almost like a screen play so I'm not surprised to find it will be made into a film. But the real reason it deserves 5* is because the author has captured our times in a profoundly psychological way. Underpinning the story and the characters is the current obsession with individuals, with selfies, with perfection. As the lives of these flawed characters unfold we know we are in a contemporary setting, we recognise these people as real. misogyny is a sticky glue that you can't shake off and is so normalised that the female characters caught in its grip never see or name it. It is reflected in the sense of entitlement of the male characters, the sinister, hidden violence just under the surface, the need to control and fear of being controlled. This is also present in the love/hate relationship characters have with Alcohol. The voyeurism that is sustained by reality TV is symbolised as Rachel stares from the train window each day and observes the lives of Megan and Scott and thinks she knows them - the Jason and Jess of her imagination who have the life she had, lost and longs for. Although internet dating does not figure in this book I heard recently that a third of couples In the 20-35 age group met online. And when they meet they tell each other lies. Lies figures almost as another character in this book. All the characters lie. They lie to each other and to themselves. As the writing carries us along we can't work out the truth from the lies either as we see the world through the first person narratives of the three main women protagonists. It is the women who are given voice and we see the male characters through their eyes, but they don't really see them, they are too caught up in the desire to have the relationship they fantasise about. Each is obsessed with self, how they feel, what their lives are like, have been, could be and it is all chimera. None of them are sympathetic characters yet we care, at least about the main character Rachel, but like Claire, who reluctantly gives Rachel a room in her house, we care because we think we should not because they are nice or good. The insidiousness of the controlling behaviour of the characters, in particular the main male character, Tom resonates with current understanding of abuse being mental and emotional as well as physical. I think the page turning nature of the book is also deceptive, it makes it seem lightweight, but it is hauntingly deep. My only disappointment is the crafting of the ending, this writer could definitely have done this better. I look forward to her maturing as a writer in her next book. "
1711,Mandi,It was similar to Gone Girl but I think it was better. I went back and forth between feeling sorry for Rachel and being annoyed with her for wrecking chances given to her. I was not surprised at the ending but I was fully engaged through out. It was a good book!
1712,Liz Fichera,"You know the kind of book that you stay up all night reading, dropping everything to spend the day finishing it, sneaking in a chapter in the grocery line and between appointments because you have to know WHO DONE IT?! That's this book."
1713,Kaceybruce,I can't stop thinking about this book
1714,Andreww,"The Girl on The Train - Paula Hawkins (Published by Doubleday 2015)Good stuff, pacy first person narrative told from three perspectives. Much hyped and acclaimed, it does deliver a great story in character. Three characters actually, Rachel, Anna and Megan. The story unfolds beautifully in a tightly written, real-time way. Modern fiction is so very good at this, taking us places and dumping us into a hyper-real world, almost filmic in its touchability and verisimilitude. Reality bites here, and to the constant rattle, screech and rock of the ever present trains, we enter frozen, broken lives. This is a thriller yes, this is popular yes, but don't get sneery, this is superbly well written and envisaged.Just like Gone Girl we have unreliable narrators, people who tell it with guile or amnesia or both. Rachel is frozen-hearted, having been dumped by her husband for a better model two years before she has fallen in alcoholism and despair. The interleaving of narratives works well, each with its own intrigue and enough question marks to keep us guessing to the end. I consumed this on Audiobook in a week and I would heartily recommend it, character voices strong, the sense of desolation and brokenness of two the female characters particularly well drawn. Women are the stars of this book and the men, virtually to a man, are the bastards. But who it? Who killed her? Who attacked Rachel? What really did happen in that underpass?Great stuff. Well done Paula, brilliant job.***** Five Stars"
1715,Yvonne,Read the last one hundred pages straight through...couldn't put it down. A nail biting story.
1716,Ian Laughton,"Loved it, couldn't put it down although I liked the way it moved from character to character it was a little hard for to keep up with at times, didn't spoil it for tho! "
1717,Lisa Mancini,"This is one of those books that you can't wait to get home and cuddle up with for a night of reading way past your bedtime. Rachel, the protagonist, is a sad, lonely drunk that has lost her husband, job and friends due to her drinking. As pretense, she continues to commute to London on the same train she use to ride to work. Sadly that train passes her old life that she can see from her regular seat. She also watched a husband and wife she grew fond of from afar. When the wife goes missing and Rachel knows she was the the area the woman disappeared from but she was drunk and can't remember what she saw or possibly did that evening. The story has twist and turns. I figured out the ending about 80% in but did not see that as a flaw. The story flowed and lead logically to its end. This book is compared to ""Gone Girl"" which makes sense give the style of writing. I think this story, characters and plot are far better. I liked the characters and cared about them. I hated Nick and Amy from ""Gone Girl"" and never cared about the ending. Rachel is sad but likable..you want her to win. Overall a great book that is highly recommended."
1718,Tara Yoder,"Great book!! unpredictable, I loved it."
1719,Julie Wilding,"The fifth star is probably because I haven't read a thriller for so long, but this was great. Spooky. Just finished it at one am and am petrified to try and sleep."
1720,Always Addicted ,"Wow, this was awesome! It was definitely a mystery worth solving page by page through the eyes of Rachel, Anna and Megan. "
1721,Mary Kay,"Great, fast read! Loved it!"
1722,Stacie,"This kept me guessing until the end! Well written, effortless prose that flowed from one page to the next."
1723,Julie Williams,"Fantastic 1st thriller read of 2015, couldn't put it down. Well worth a read even if this genre isn't your usual bag. The characters are so believable. If you commute by train your journey may never be the same again. "
1724,Cindy,Devoured this book in one sitting! Just couldn't put it down...had to know what happened! Unexpected conclusion
1725,Tanya Eby,"I really loved this. It took me a bit to get into it and figure out what was going on and who was talking, but once I figured it out, I was really swept in. And I loved reading about a character who was an alcoholic, because it seemed to present that really truthfully. I wish Paula Hawkins had more books. "
1726,Bess Conner,A great readI don't read mysteries very often. Maybe I should rethink that. This story kept me guessing and just about made me late for work. 
1727,Sharon Atkinson,"I thought this was a great read. I could not put it down. I loved the little twists and turns and the fact that you get all three main women characters point of view. Well written and I would definitely recommend it.It does make me wonder if I should now stop looking out the train window, going to and from work. Who knows what I might see. ;o)"
1728,Scott,An excellent read. It read like a train ride. It started out slowly but built up such speed halfway through that you could not stop. It kept you guessing until the end. And the last paragraphs......holy shirts and pants I nearly screamed out loud. 
1729,Katie George,"I was a little but nervous about this one because I saw it compared to Gone Girl repeatedly, which I did not enjoy because I felt like I couldn't connect to any of the characters. This book is similar in that it deals with some pretty crazy things and leaves you completely surprised by the end, but I found the characters much more sympathetic and relatable, especially Rachel. This is definitely a fast paced thriller and an entirely enjoyable one. It took me right up until the very end to piece everything together, but it all came together in a logical, albeit crazy and exciting, manner. I would definitely recommend. "
1730,Valerie Sparkle,I absolutely loved this book. It really kept me guessing. I also really enjoyed the alternating points of view. Each character had their own story and their own issues and it all just blew me away at the end.
1731,Jia,"I was in a reading slump when I read this book, and I flew through it. It is soooooo good. Although the ending is a bit predictable (it's a simple elimination process really, because there isn't that many characters in this book), it doesn't stop me from reading it. My hands were cold and I was so excited when I turned the last page. However, somewhere in the middle of the book, I got so angry reading it. I felt sorry for Rachel but at the same time I felt like she deserves all the mistreatments. She is so weak and whiny and she just keeps going. At some point I felt like I want to grab her out of the book and shake some sense into her, tell her to tidy herself up and stop obsessing over a man who is no longer in love with her. Oh well, of course Rachel has to be The Rachel, she is what makes this book so thrilling and addictive. Like another reviewer has stated, everyone is a hot mess in this book and that is so true. There isn't a single ""good"" character in this book. Everyone has dirty secretes or flaws, and that is what makes this book better than some others that I've read. In reality, our mind can be pretty dark and fucked up, and that is what makes this book real. "
1732,Joseph Baksha,I grabbed this book quickly during a trip and wasn't sure what to expect. The author's ability to set the scene with every detail allow you to feel like you are standing right next to the characters as they interact. This gets you through the first half of the story as you are just trying to figure out what is going on and why the characters are such a mess. Then the books just rolls down the tracks and you don't want to get off at any of the stops until you are done. Great read if you like mysteries bundled with messy people with messy lives.
1733,Jim,"Phew! This isn't great literature but it's a top-notch, suspenseful can't-put-it-down page-turner. The plot is slightly reminiscent of Rear Window, an old Hitchcock movie; someone starts observing strangers from a distance and is then drawn into their lives. The engaging story and the author's pert style make for most enjoyable reading."
1734,Sarah Robinson,"Well I should have learned my lesson and not read this book before bed because I got about halfway through before I fell asleep, and ended up with chilling nightmares! But that only tells me that this book is great because it infiltrated my mind, my heart, and now my dreams. This book is dark. Like super dark. Every character in this book is dislikable, on purpose. There is no good guy, no angel, no protagonist. Just a whole bunch of messed up people running amuck and wrecking each other's lives. It's a book about lies, deceit, and false personas. It's a book about real life. The darkest parts of real life, but real none the less. That's probably one of the reasons I liked it so much, because there was no sugar coated, ideal character. Everyone was wrong, and in the wrong, and acted wrong, only some were at worse degrees than others. But you still walk away from this book unsure of which character you can defend, which one you can feel happy for, because you really can't. They are all terrible, terrible people who do terrible things and suffer terrible consequences for it. And yet, isn't that what life is?Overall, a great read by Ms. Hawkins, and I can't wait to read more from her in the future. Fabulous job. Just fabulous. "
1735,Stephanie Cowart,This was so good!!! So suspenseful and hard to predict. A great read with plenty of twists and turns. Highly recommended!
1736,Betsy,"I rate this as one of the better books I've read. Compelling. Amazing balance between voices. Chilling and disturbing story. There isn't a single redeeming character in the book, except maybe Cathy (who is a total enabler). Read it! "
1737,Bonnie E.,"I will never look out windows of trains quite the way I used to.Once I started reading this book, I could not put it down. It felt like Rear Window, Gone Girl and an Agatha Christie novel all at once. The story is told from the perspective of three women - Rachel, Anna and Megan - as their lives become entangled in some unusual ways. None are heroic, kind, strong or likable but as the story develops, you gain an appreciation for their struggles, and they each become somewhat sympathetic. Although not entirely.Rachel is a divorced, unemployed, alcoholic in her early thirties who is obsessed with her former husband, Tom. Anna was Tom's mistress when he was married to Rachel, and now she is Tom's wife and the mother of his baby daughter. Megan and her husband live down the street from Anna and Tom, and Megan is also Anna and Tom's daughter's former nanny. This is just the tip of the iceberg to describe how their lives are intertwined. There is much much more.Even though she was fired from her job a few months earlier, Rachel takes a commuter train every day while pretending to be employed so as not to incur the wrath (and eviction) of her landlady. The train ride gives her something to do and serves as the primary source of daily solace to Rachel along with copious amounts of alcohol. The route takes her past the home where she used to live with Tom, and where he continues to live with his petite new wife Anna. The train always stops directly behind the house where another young couple lives, and Rachel often sees them out on their terrace or in their yard. This couple is exquisite and she fantasizes about them as having the perfect marriage, the life she thought she had with Tom before everything went wrong. She has named them Jason and Jess. We later come to know them as Megan and Scott, and they live a few houses down from Tom and Anna. One day Rachel sees something startling from the train window and the story unfolds from there. The story is recounted over a period of about a year, with flashbacks here and there, and Rachel, Anna and Megan become known to us through their first hand accounts of their own lives and of one another's. The book takes us through infidelities, physical and emotional abuse, self discovery, alcoholic black outs, marital joy and marital despair, deception, sex, pregnancy and parenthood, and ultimately murder. We get to know Tom through the lens of all three narrators, and Megan's husband Scott is presented as a good man and as a bad man, depending on the point of view. The same is true of Megan's psychiatrist, who Rachel also begins to see as part of her sleuthing to uncover the truth of Megan's disappearance. There are two police officers who become involved in the mystery, and even these two act oddly at times. No one is what they seem, and everyone is a suspect. It is all rather fantastical but the suspense builds as the plot bubbles and thickens, and the more we learn about all of the characters, the more creeped out we become. I figured out a few of the plot twists before they were unveiled, which I think the author wants her readers to do, but it did not take away from the ending. The finale was as creepy as can be, but because of the skillful way the story is developed, it is entirely believable. "
1738,Carly Giles,Let's just say I finished this in three sittings and toward the end my roommate had to come into my room to make sure I was okay because I was yelling out of shock. Multiple times. 
1739,Tia Louise,"Went from DNF to Five Stars--go figure!I felt like the first 80 PERCENT (that's a lot!) was slow, slow, slow.And I was growing so weary of Rachel's alcoholism and just all of it... bleah!The last 20 percent saved the day.Glad I finished~ "
1740,Grier,"I loved this book. I was sucked in from the very beginning. The writing was spot on and the story was interesting. The characters were well developed and the story flowed. I compared it to Gone Girl because that's what other people were doing. I read this book almost as fast as I read Gone Girl, but I didn't fling it against the wall and spend the next week seething over the ending. The ending was satisfying and fitting. So I thought it was 100% better than Gone Girl. I read it in 2 days."
1741,Maite Vela,"4,5 estrellasMe ha gustado mucho el libro, la forma que tiene de mantenerte enganchando a la historia, en hacerte muchas teorías que cambiaban y cambiaban. Al principio piensas unas cosas y conforme vas leyendo vas cambiando de opinión, hasta llegar al final. No voy a comentar mucho más porque es un libro que es mejor leer sin saber mucho para sorprenderte hoja a hoja. Le doy 4,5 de 5 estrellas porque si es verdad que en determinadas ocasiones se me han hecho un poco largo, y en el final no. E encajaba las actitud de algunos personajes. En conclusión he disfrutado de esta lectura."
1742,Kels Fidler,"Title: The Girl on the TrainAuthor: Paula HawkinsAge Group: AdultGenre: ThrillerSeries: N/AStar Rating: 5 out of 5 starsThis book was given to me by the publisher, Riverhead Hardcover, through Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review.Do you like thrillers? Especially Gone Girl? If you've answered yes to either of these questions, this book is for you! This book was incredibly creepy--claustrophobic, even. The pacing was spot on--I couldn't put it down. I devoured this book in a day and a half. Rachel, the ex-wife, the drunk, the woman whose life fell apart, is trying so hard not to let her drinking get the best of her.. And often, she loses to that vice. Then there's Anna, the ex-mistress, the new wife to Rachel's ex, Tom. She doesn't really care about anyone about herself, Tom, and her daughter, Evie. And lastly, there's Megan, the discontent neighbor, restless and secretive.. I love the way the story wove together, the way every little detail mattered, and I was breathless through most of this novel. The bottom line: A top-notch debut from a promising author, I loved The Girl on the Train--easily one of my favorite books I've read this year! Next on deck: The Orphan of Torundi by J.L. McCreedy!"
1743,Dawn Michelle,"HOLY. FREAKING. MOSES. AND because I am reading this for book club, that is the ONLY review I can do at this time. "
1744,Kiranjit,A compulsive read; I could not turn the pages fast enough. I want everyone I know to read it so we can all talk about it! If you liked Before I Go To Sleep by S J Watson - you will love this!
1745,Monique,"Wow! It's not often a book has me losing hours, but this one did. It's fast-paced, well written and believable, and I had a hard time putting it down. It's about perception and how a lot of the time we see things as we want them to be, or through a lens of prejudice and preconception, rather than how they actually are. It's not just about how Rachel learns the truth about the people she sees from the train, but also about how others see her.Unlike some thrillers, the author lets the story unfold gradually, rather than telling us what happened right at the start and writing about how the others catch on, or how they solve the mystery. The mystery isn't revealed until several chapters into the book. The facts about what has appeared to have happened are revealed gradually, and pieces of the story fit together well, with no convenient but improbable coincidences and characters which do realistic things. It's possible that these events could be occurring anywhere at any time. Which is what makes it very creepy.I really enjoyed this above-average thriller and look forward to the author's next offering. It certainly made me look at my fellow train commuters in a different light. "
1746,Susie Kline,"I loved The Girl On The Train. Seriously loved it. I loved it so much I had to take a reading break when I finished to let it soak into my psyche.I came across this book by accident. I read it because it was compared to Gone Girl, which I liked but couldn't relate to the characters much. I thought it might be the same with The Girl On The Train. That wasn't the case. But I will share that there are pathological characters in this book.This is a book that begs to be re-read. It needs to be savored, but you want to read as fast as possible to get through the story.The moral of the story: things are never as they seem."
1747,Ilah Murphy,"Psychological Page Turning MysteryThis was a book that I could not put down. I could not see ahead of where the story was going and never was very fond of the main character until late in the novel. I'm not sure I cared a lot about any of the characters. This was the first time I read Paula Hawkins. I'm unsure if I will actively pursue another of her books, although I believe her future books will be even better. The reading got a bit confusing at times on which character was talking. The chapters are divided by each speaking character. After a few chapters, I got the hang of it. The answers come bit by bit explaining the plot and they came at just the right time almost like bits of a tasty treat that make you think, ""Oh, so that's what was going on."" It would have been nice to finalize each character but it had no effect on the story. What ever happened to the therapist or the red headed guy? A part that I enjoyed because I was caught up in the plot was when coming to spots in reading where I would talk to the character and make a suggestion. Much like watching a movie when you think, ""No! No! Do not open that door!"" I would definitely recommend this book to mystery fans."
1748,Silvy McGinity,"3 women, all seem pretty normal till one goes missing. I laughed, cried and was on the edge of my seat. I couldn't put the book down. Well written."
1749,Marylou,I could not put this one down.
1750,Justyna,"Very good. I am usually pretty good a predicting a lot of these mysteries in books but this one nearly got me. It wasn't until near the end that I caught on to what happened. And it still managed to give me a minor surprise at the end!This was a real page-turner of a book! I tore through it. The characters--oy. There is probably not one character I can say I actually liked, though that didn't stop me from cheering one or two of them on. It REALLY made me despise others, though, and this often included the main character (or who I think the main character is, anyway). "
1751,Connie,"Hands down the best mystery I've read in a long, long time. "
1752,Marcy Marinelli,"Be ready to put your life on hold when you start reading this book. I couldn't put it down! There are so many twists and turns in the plot and any hunches you have about ""who done it"" aren't going to be answered until the end of the book. I guarantee you will be surprised by the outcome. All the characters are flawed in their own ways and one some level each of them is unlikeable. As a counselor I thought a lot about how each of the characters became the person they are and what needs were being met through their situations. It was an engrossing read!"
1753,LoonyBabeJo,""" It’s because I feel like I’m part of this mystery, I’m connected. I am no longer just a girl on the train, going back and forth without point or purpose""Rachel . Anna. Megan. This three women have a lot more in common, more than they knew it... Each of The girl's POV explains their character. It's a definite page turner, you just can't simply stop coz you really like to know what and how everything happens,. The ending was excellent,. more to follow ......My favorite character was definitely Rachel though frankly, I didnt like her at first, she's this messed up and broken person that had so many issues in life, wallows in self pity and a drunkard...., she thinks she's worthless because she can't have something she truly wants, she's not the kind of woman you want yourself to be with, but as the story progresses, i admired her strength, the will to help others, to be involve, to have a purpose., and that's why she dig into the mystery that only she can truly unravel because without her remembering it, she's the only witness."" the holes in your life are permanent. You have to grow around them, like tree roots around concrete; you mould yourself through the gaps"""
1754,Serena McClain,"I never really got the hype surrounding Gone Girl. It was a perfectly satisfactory book, but that's really all it did for me. This? This was a deliciously plotted psychological thriller! I loved every minute of it."
1755,P,"This *needs* to be a series! Paula Hawkins, are you listening? Forget the haters, you made the rest of us care about this character and now she should have her own series like a latter-day Miss Marple (as nosy but also willing to sleep with suspects when the investigation requires it). I mean have you seen the travesty that television has made of the Marple series recently, relegating her to a sidey role while some floozie takes centre-stage because older women are like poor people (we know they exist but they must not spoil our entertainment by invading our tv screens). Paula Hawkins: Write a sequel. Make this a series, pretty puhleeze. So happy to see that: 1) character (instead of just nonstop action) is making a literary comeback. 2) the madness of modern marriage is being exposed post Richard Yates (he did his bit for his era but since then we've been languishing)3) novels can end without our flawed heroes having to apologize for their subversiveness by disappearing into the unicorn-laden sunset all safely partnered up4) someone can say, yeah but let's not romanticize the sisterhood either5) we can't leave it to the professional detectives and police to solve our mysteries, amateur sleuths are irreplaceable. i.e. we better save ourselves.6) books by mature women with mature characters can be a smashing success without a--hiding behind a male pen-name or b--tucking your female hero behind your male one like a prop. J.K. Rowling, dearie, take note of this one. Hallelujah!"
1756,Kristi Richardson,"“I’ve been the fool. If he does it with you, he’ll do it to you.” This is the story of three women, Rachel, Anna, and Meghan. Rachel is the Girl on the Train, who likes to watch the people in the houses that the commuter train passes every day and imagine how they live and how perfect their lives are compared to her lonely existence. Then one day something happens to one of these perfect people and Rachel feels incredibly drawn to find out what really happened. None of the characters are ""perfect people"". They are all very real. Rachel has a problem with alcohol, Anna is a guilty ""home wrecker"" and Meghan has a secret from her past that is keeping her from ever being a whole person. This is tremendous thriller and it has a complete ending. So many books nowadays seem to end with a sequel in mind but not so for this. You can feel like you know the whole story. There are plenty of twists and turns in this story and it kept me guessing right until the very end. The people in this story, while not wholly likeable become people you root for unlike the unlovable characters in ""Gone Girl"". You know this will be a movie but I recommend you read the book first, it's truly wonderful. Paula Hawkins is new at fiction writing but her future is bright. The three ladies who do the narration, Clare Corbett, Louise Brealey and India Fisher all do a clever job with their characters. Don't miss this one! "
1757,Meghan Elkins,"Gone Girl was terrible. The Girl on the Train is more well-written, has crisper prose, and even more abhorrent characters (if you can even imagine that!).I liked the ending, too, which was the worst part of Gone Girl. Please, everyone, let's all start talking about The Girl on the Train!! "
1758,Megan Thurston,This book is amazingly thrilling! It kept me on my toes the whole time! 
1759,Kath Middleton,"In this thriller we first take the viewpoint of Rachel, the girl on the train. Daily she passes the road on which she used to live and sees a couple a few doors away whose lives fascinate her. As the book progresses we see the viewpoint of the girl she watches and of the woman who usurped her as her husband’s second wife. Rachel is an alcoholic and suffers blackouts. She’s been made aware that she’s done some disgraceful things when drunk, some of which resulted in her husband’s affair and their subsequent divorce. We watch a drama unfolding and learn much more about the lives of all three women and about what actually happened in some of Rachel’s blackout moments.I found this a very compulsive read. The writing style with its rushed, run-on sentences initially annoyed me but I suspect the fact that I was reading faster was partly down to that. It’s a great thriller and full of unexpected revelations. Very enjoyable."
1760,Charlotte,"Really gripping story, i honestly couldn't put it down! Anyone that liked Gone Girl or similar books will like this for sure."
1761,Lauren Strasnick,Loved. Could not put this down.
1762,Dannielle Insalaco,Wow!! I read this in a day. I could not put it down!
1763,Laura Lauderback,What a page turner! This book keeps you on your toes from start to finish. Excellently written and great characters. Enthralling.
1764,Jamie Smith,"The pace was good. Despite the characters being such hot messes, I was still so engrossed in it all! "
1765,Meredith Schorr,"I loved the suspense. I was biting my nails for the last 15% wondering how it was all going to go down. There were times during the first half that I thought it was dragging on a bit and I found the voices of the three women somewhat similar, but any minor complaints I had were erased by the fast pace of the last 15%."
1766,Lorri Helms,Kept my attention and had a hard time putting it down.
1767,Jordanna East,"Loved it. This was an excellent thriller with an interesting plot, fleshed out (unreliable) characters, and so many twists and turns you can't put it down. As usual, when I really enjoy a book, I don't have much to say except to recommend others run out and read it."
1768,Tiff,What a wild ride.
1769,Gem Holbrook,"Wow!! What a great story. What a great plot. And what great characters. Part way through, this was shouting and hollering 'Gone Girl' at me and as much as I liked that book the characters were annoying and unbelievable. Which delightedly is a stark contrast to the characters in this novel. The narratives over the 3 girls was amazing and the writing skill to tie everything together was so impressive. There wasn't anything I didn't like, and couldn't put it down, so much so I completed it in less than 24hours. Top 3 books I've read this year definitely. "
1770,Senta Bahr-root,"Fast read, entertaining. Definitely recommend it."
1771,Donna Radcliff,"When I was in elementary school, many years ago, I had a teacher who would would bring in a puzzle for the class to solve. It would be a large picture, covered with a sheet of cardboard that had been cut into jigsaw pieces. She would take a piece of the puzzle out, ask a question and the student with the correct answer got a chance to guess what the picture was behind the cardboard. Everyone would think they knew what the hidden picture was, but as each puzzle piece was removed, we saw something different. Sometimes she would turn the picture on its side, or upside down, making everything look totally different. More often than not, we wouldn't figure it out until the last part of the picture was revealed and we'd be so surprised.This is what The Girl on The Train reminded of, a continually shifting story that changed with each chapter. Told through the voices of three women, Rachel, Anna and Meghan, life as seen through the window of a moving train is not always what it seems. A cleverly written suspense/mystery, it might remind the reader of Gone Girl, but this story stands completely on its own."
1772,Peishan Tan,"the characters, especially the protagonist, aren't particularly likable, but five stars because it is a page turner i picked it up in the evening and only put it down a few hours later when I was done."
1773,Esteban Parra,"Reseña: http://goo.gl/e7i47CEs increíble la forma en que este libro te mete en un laberinto y por momentos, te deja sin salida alguna. Es muy, pero muy difícil dejar de leerlo. No es un libro excelente, pero condensa de manera ingeniosa todos los elementos de un buen thriller y no deja que lo sueltes. Eso vale mucho."
1774,Carly K,"This is one of those hard-to-put down whodunnit type books. The unreliable narrator is a fantastic lens through which to experience the book, although hers is not the only perspective readers are treated to. Divorced, depressed, and usually drunk Rachel takes the train into London for work each day. She lives with a roommate she doesn't quite care for, works at a job she is at best indifferent to, and, daily, watches the houses on her former street through the train window. She can see the house where her ex-husband and his new wife live and enjoys imagining the lives of another couple that live a few houses down. This watching turns to obsession when the young woman disappears, seemingly coincidentally on a night where a drunk and heartbroken Rachel has unwisely gone stumbling through her former neighborhood. As Rachel struggles to piece together the missing hours, readers realize just how unreliable Rachel's memories are. I would particularly recommend this for fans of Gone Girl or anyone who loves Hitchcock. This is a kind of post-feminist Rear Window."
1775,Karen Page,Worth the read. 
1776,Tanya Patrice,Loved it and the audio book is awesome.
1777,Carol Balawyder,"Hawkins doesn’t need another review and so all I’ll say is that if you’re looking for a page turner, if you’re looking to understand the power of alcoholism and emotional abuse, if you like chapters which end with a twist that keep you up at night saying I’ll just read one more chapter then read The Girl on The Train. It won’t disappoint. "
1778,Leyla,"At first I thought, ""Depressing,"" but I persevered and OMG! Must-read. Very well done."
1779,Jessica,Wow this book would make a great movie!! The ending was intense!!!
1780,Travelling Sunny,"Meme Review:All aboaaaaaaard! It's the... This is not your standard Fatal Attraction. Oh, the twists and turns and craziness! Enjoy this ride on the crazy train! Next stop - the asylum! MWA-HA-HA-HA-HA!"
1781,Christie Bettendorf,Couldn't put this down!
1782,Kristin,I would highly recommend the audiobook. the narrators were excellent! I absolutely loved it! think I would have found it to be a little slow had I read it instead of listened to it.
1783,Olivia,"If Paula Hawkins can do anything, it's make well rounded and relatable characters, as proven by this page turning thriller.I found this an easy book to get through, despite having a slow build to a less-than-expected climax.Hawkins masterfully built the plot to what I had hoped would be a crazy mind-bending crescendo, but unfortunately didn't. It was still interesting, but a bit of a disappointment, to me at least.All in all this was an intriguing novel that was great for curling up with on a cold winters day, but will probably not be changing any lives any time soon."
1784,Beatrix,"Picked this book up at midnight BIG MISTAKE as it is UNPUTDOWNABLE book in the same league as ""Gone Girl"". Highly recommend read. Psychological Thriller"
1785,Michele M. Hall,Still thinking about it! Can't get this one out of my head...a flawed heroine trying to work things out through an alcoholic fog. Compelling. Kept me up until 2 am. Hitchcock would have loved to direct this ! 
1786,Lynsey Farmer,"Rachel commutes to london everyday by the same train along the way she sees a couple who she starts referring to as jess and jason and to her they are the prefect couple they live on the same street as her ex husband and his new wife . On the way to London one morning rachel sees something that makes her realise that jess and jason are not as prefect as she thought they was and by witnessing this event it allows rachel to become part of their lives.I brought this thursday on release day there was so much hype about this book on twitter that on that morning at 5.20 i woke up turned my kindle on and started reading and did the same on saturday morning this book gripped me and made me read it until i was on the last page.The story is told by 3 female narratives rachel our lead, megan (the so called jess) and the new wife of rachels ex husband Anna.The three character narratives were flawless but i can honestly say i have never read a book with so many messed up characters my first thoughts of rachel was that she was an alcholic stalker, every character has there own problems , they are all deceitful but this made the story for me as they was all suspicious and it had me turning the pages.The more i read the more rachel grew on me in parts of the book i am willing for her not to have a drink and to sort herself out and by doing this she would (not spoling the story) remember the events.I did not see the ending at all it surprised me as i had suscipions about every single character. The ending was very clean it tied everything up.This review does not the book any justice so urge if your reading my review and not read it to buy the book.With its flawless narration, a perfect story and just basically everything about this book i could easily see this book being my best read of the year and the book of 2015"
1787,Reem,This book is the epitome of thrillers. I had always been a fan of mysteries (and mystery was the very first genre that got me reading) and this book is the most thrilling mystery I've ever read. I would recommend this to a fan of mystery/thriller.
1788,Lina,"I loved this book. If I'm going to be honest I did prefer this a little more than Gone Girl. But not by much.This is full of suspense, fast paste, thrilling, great character building and overall amazing, capturing story. Already want to read it again. From the start I really connect with Rachael and her depression they way that she was feeling after the break down of her marriage. I cant quite put my finger on why I connected to her so much, but from her first, I guess Diary entry, I really just felt for her character and enjoyed her part of the story. And the way that she tried to help others even though they could not see what she was trying to do. Megan on the other hand took me a while to get used to. But in the end I still didn't really connect with her as much as I did Rachael. I didn't like the Megan was a player and that she didn't see the harm in what she was doing with other guys and the affect it was having on her husband (Scott). But she did not deserve the ending that she got. Now Anna, you didn't really get as much of her story as you did Rachael and Megan but the parts of her story that you did get I was drawn in. She was a mother to loved her child and would do anything for the safety of her child. She had to put up with so much, but she did all that for her child. That was honestly the only real thing that I liked about Anna. Because I identified with Rachael so much the tension between them two I didn't like but it did help the story in the end.This is very much all about the girl power. But also about physical abuse and in some ways mental abuse from a partner. But overall AMAZING :) x"
1789,Kristie Bueno,"Fantastic late night read! Thoroughly enjoyed the mystery and twists, the author keeps you wanting more. Twisted and sinister...a guilty pleasure indeed!"
1790,Marty,"Every once in a while I read a book that takes my breath away. The Girl On The Train is just such a book. To say that it is a psychological thriller just does not give full value to the plot line. Rachel, the star (?) of the book is a complete mess with her life splattered across alternate chapters. You don't know what to think of her; fear, loathing, sympathy. Since she lost her husband life continues down hill. To fill her idle time she creates story lines; lives for the people she sees from the train window as she goes to no job in the city, and to no life of her own. Things take a dramatic turn when one of the women she has seen over the weeks and months goes missing.Rachel gets herself involved to an extreme extent; you can only guess her motives as she goes from one drink to another, one lie to another.I can see why this book is so popular. Not sure another mystery can ever compete"
1791,Lisa Lou,"Very good page turner for author's first novel. Well written characters that made you hate them, like them, cheer for them, yell at them, and want to shake some sense into them. I would recommend this book to others."
1792,Amy Davis,Loved reading this book and I am eager to watch the movie (when it comes out.) It has a similar tone to Gone Girl but is creepier (towards the end) and faster paced.
1793,Lekshmy,"A fantastic, gripping thriller. I would recommend this to anyone who likes thriller. Book is so engaging, captures all the character's perspective and feelings. Rachael, who is one of the character , is a messed up girl who want to do some thing that is meaningful .Rachael who commutes everyday by train, likes to observe from train and build her version of story. She was particularly attracted to a couple, whom she named Jess and Jason and weaved a happy life around them. Her intrigue on Jess and Jason's life, when she finds Jess missing is the one that helps her to come back to reality and bring her life back to track."
1794,Shayan,"The start is calming but don't be fooled because it's simply setting the scene for you, then you're thrown into this mystery making it almost impossible to stop reading. Full review here: http://msphoenixgilmore.wordpress.com..."
1795,Mary Collins,"Everyone said this was a great book and they were right! It's page-turning mystery, set in the outskirts of London. Paul Hawkins gets into the minds and emotions of her characters as they deal with an event that sadly, has become almost commonplace in today's headlines. "
1796,Marti,"Along the same lines as GONE GIRL, this is a great thriller with many unexpected twists. Although vital to the story, I found Rachel, the protagonist, to be rather annoying. I really liked the way the story was laid out, and I had a hard time putting it down."
1797,Ivana de Bona,"This was a great read! First 100 pages I was a bit confused, I tried hard to connect the missing pieces, but they just wouldn't come together. That intrigued me very much since there aren't many books these days that leave me wondering. As the novel progressed and I started developing various theories about characters and the murded itself I realized how much I enjoyed reading this novel. Most of my theories ended up slightly or completely wrong, but that gave me even more satisfaction since I felt as if I was having an amazing dialogue with a very wise interlocutor.I must admit the main character, Rachel Watson was quite unappealing. She disguisted me from the first page with how little control she had over he life and everything in it. I tried to undestand he, but I always found myself diguisted.I recomend this book! "
1798,Lucille Zimmerman,"This was the best fiction book I've ever read. Except I didn't read it myself, I let the beautiful voices on Audible read them to me. Typically I can't listen to audible books unless they are non-fiction, because I lose my place or forget to pay attention, or forget who is talking. This book never once let me forget. The voices were so well done, so distinct, and always reminded me where I was in he story. I would recommend the audio to everyone because it truly enhanced my experience. Mind you, the voices are British. I'm a Licensed Professional Counselor, so I read it with a counselor's vantage point. The transference part of the book where Megan ""falls in love with her therapist"" was very believeable. I would call this book a psychological killer. It's like a Dateline episode, only much more detailed. You are constantly inside the three women's head. Rachel is the divorced women who likes to drink on the train. As she does, she stares out the window and projects pretend lives onto the people she sees. She is bitter because she couldn't get pregnant.Anna is the ""other woman."" She marries Rachel's ""ex"" Tom, and has a baby. A baby that Rachel had hoped to have. Megan and Scott are the couple that Rachel sees from the train window. They live in a house near the one where she used to live with Tom. Rachel imagines they live in perfect bliss. As the story unfolds, you will find each woman, and each man, have something to hide.At times the action slows, so you can hear the voices inside the characters, but never for a minute does this dark psychological train slow down! "
1799,Margie,Very readable and well written considering the pacing and suspense.
1800,Marta,"I definitely got some weird looks from my classmates and even teachers when I told them I was reading this book and genuinely enjoying it but, personally, I found this book really difficult to put down.The first few pages might be a little confusing but do not let that fool you. Carry on reading, it will get you hooked. Some chapters might feel a little heavier than others, but they all seem to add something important to the story: Maybe some were slow-paced, but certainly not a filler chapter, which I would've hated.There's some amazing character development in this novel, which is also very far from unrealistic. Well, the entire novel is far from that.I love plot twists in books, and the final 20-30 pages of this book completely turn the story around in such a way that leaves you with a feeling of excitement and anticipation, but everything still manages to make perfect sense, and all the pieces of the story fit together perfectly.All in all, great thriller, great novel, 10/10 would recommend."
1801,daisychainbooks," With starred reviews from Publishers Weekly and Kirkus Reviews and a soon-to-be-in-the-works movie, The Girl on the Train, the debut novel from former Journalist Paula Hawkins, is already one of the most buzzed about titles of 2015. Even before this book was published it was talked about in ‘hottest fiction auction of the summer’ terms and you know that those eye-roll inducing words ‘next Gone Girl’ have been mentioned somewhere along the lines, too. This kind of hype can make or break a book for me, and it's often true that when a book attracts this much pre-publication buzz, it’s hard to live up to all that publisher acclaim. Especially for a debut.But The Girl on the Train is no ordinary debut. As for living up to all that pre-publication buzz – this book has no problems on that front either.Read the rest of this review: http://daisychainbookreviews.blogspot..."
1802,Sara I.,"The beginning was a touch slow for me but once it picked up it Had me on the edge of my seat until the very end. Wow, what an incredible book. Thrilling and suspenseful; I truly loved it."
1803,Melodie,Annoying at the beginning but scary and interesting at the end.
1804,Deb Jacobs,"I'm not normally a thriller reader, but when friends recommended the book I thought I'd give it a go, safe in the knowledge that, having recently given myself permission to stop reading part way through, I didn't have to finish it. No need for that! I thoroughly enjoyed it and found myself sucked into the story like drowning in quicksand. I liked the way chapters were told from the three principal women's points of view and had dates to tell you when the action took place. The characters were really well described and I wondered if the author had personal experience of alcoholism in particular, since so many little phrases rang true. There were other elements which made me wonder the same thing, though I won't spoil the story for you. It was a real page turner with the tension building perfectly towards the end - I stayed up late to finish it. I was aching to see what the conclusion would be yet resisted the temptation to flip to the end: the writing is that good. I rarely give a book five stars, but this deserves it and I can only urge you to read it. "
1805,Marnie,Loved it. Never would've guessed. Jeez. 
1806,Jennifer,"As Rachel passes the homes along the track of her daily commuter train, she imagines the stories of their lives. One couple in particular grabs her fancy and she eagerly fills in the details of “Jess & Jason’s” life. Until one day, she witnesses something that just doesn’t fit – and then finds she must tell the police what she saw. But will what she saw help at all?Oh who to trust, who to trust among the three female narrators in this fast-paced, whip-through-the-pages thriller? How about none of them! Most all in law enforcement know how unreliable eye witness testimony can be and Paula Hawkins’ shows us this with gusto.Count me among those who burned through this book and lost sleep to get to the end. I thoroughly enjoyed the mystery that kept me guessing until the last 60 pages."
1807,Alexandra Brooks,"I couldn't put this book down. Dark, chilling yet relatable and completely engaging. Great read!!!"
1808,Keriann Davey,"I think this is the sort of book Gone Girl was trying to be but failed!!Oh my goodness this book is gooooood!!! I was totally hooked from the word go and couldn't put it down, I think I guessed who did it when I was about 60% of the way through but this didn't spoil it at all because I wanted to keep reading to see if I was right. I have read some reviews that it was uncomfortable to read and the characters to dark and flawed but to me this is what makes a good thriller. I really liked Rachel as a character and felt sorry for her. This book is written from the three main characters points of view and I feel this thickened the plot. I won't give anything away but if you are looking for a gripping thriller this book is for you."
1809,Ashleigh Bello,"I normally don't read mystery novels, but this book has me wanting more! Ms. Hawkins did a wonderful job keeping me enthralled with every character. Rachel was unbelievably addicting to follow as her character developed, and I couldn't believe all the twists that were waiting at the end! Honestly, this novel delves deep into the reality of the worst that human nature can amount to from all angles. It makes you think twice about your decisions in life. Every single character seemed lost in their own seriously shameful worlds, and together they made an utterly engaging story."
1810,Michelle Bahamou-santiago,There is some serious fucking crazy going on here! <3
1811,Beverley,"I couldn't find too much I didn't like about it. I ordered it because it was about a ""fantasist"" traveling by a train in London area. Love London, and love the trains, so I was intrigued. I think Paula Hawkins does an interesting job of developing characters through first person narrating. I liked this technique a lot. Everyone is hiding something.......isn't that always the truth. The main character, Rachel was pathetic, to say the least. But interesting in how she seems to be able to control her alcoholism when she needs to. I question if that's entirely possible, ......maybe. Still enjoyed it."
1812,Evandro Roberto,"A maioria das pessoas que não gostou desse livro já leu Gone Girl, e ficou decepcionado após tanta comparação entre as obras.Eu, no entanto, ainda não li Gone Girl. Não li nenhum outro livro do gênero, na verdade. Então não tinha noção alguma do que esperar.MAS GENTE, QUE LIVRO.QUE ESCRITA.QUE DESENVOLVIMENTO DE PERSONAGENS.QUE TUDO.""Foi bonito, foi. Foi intenso, foi."""
1813,Robert,"Absolutely enjoyed this book. The writing style was different than anything else I have read. The story is told from the perspective of three different people and makes excellent use of jumping backward and forward in time to carry out the slow reveal of the characters, motives, character flaws (of which there are many), and the overall timeline. But don't worry, it's not time travel. Each chapter heading includes the date/time of day and the name of the character that is in first person. I found myself flipping back and forth to compare timelines and who saw what and when.The emotions of the characters take center stage and the story is far richer for it. If drama stresses you out, this might now be a good book for you. I enjoyed the elegance of how the story unfolded right up to the ending.I strongly recommend this book."
1814,Gill Edwards," Psychological thrillers are my favourite genre of novels and I've read an awful lot of them, some can be wishy, washy with no real plot to speak of. The Girl on the Train however, is different. It's packed full of thrilling twists and turns, cleverly timed revelations and edge of seat tension. The story starts slowly as each chapter introduces you to the main female characters of Rachel, Anna and Megan but it is never boring and you don't find yourself wanting it to speed up or get on with it, its beautifully paced from the start.I cant say that I actually liked any of the characters but I did feel sympathy with one or two as their lives clearly had not gone the way they would have liked and the story is based on the consequences of some bad decisions and actions. I probably felt the most for Megan who had a bad childhood and Rachel who life has never treated very fairly. Rachel mixes fact with fantasy until she has no idea what the truth is anymore. She needs to be part of what's going on as it gives her a reason to get up in the morning, a sense of purpose again. The plot had as many stops and starts as the train journey she takes each day. I felt I knew my way round the town of Ashbury and especially Blenheim Road by the time i'd finished it.It was hard to know who to believe in the end and the final pages are just stunning.The author has a very smooth, easy writing style which kept me reading, always greedy for one more chapter.This book deserves to be huge, I absolutely loved it!Verdict: fabulous story, beautifully writtenRating: 5/5 "
1815,Renata Barcelos,"What a fantastic psychological mystery! Can't wait for this author's next book.(The audible version is perfect too, with all 3 narrators very compelling.)"
1816,Nick,"Unfortunately events ruined my momentum in reading this book but it is still a wild addictive ride. I hate the Gone Girl comparison, but if you're forcing my hand, it's better."
1817,Daniela,"Wow! Yes, it is all everyone says it is… This story got my attention from the first page and I truly enjoyed the whole ride. When writing this review, I was trying to find something that I didn't like about it,to be fair, but couldn’t find anything and this is what my 5 star rating shows. The plot basically revolves around Rachel, who takes the same commuter train every day and suddenly sees something rather than usual, that changes her life for ever. This particularly event and a few mental-life crisis moments will make Rachel figure out that what is in front of you, sometimes is not always what it seems to be.It is told through the voice of three different women, which gives the narrative a more clear insight and adds mystery to the story. I have read Gone Girl before and I can say is one of my favorite thrillers of all time.I thought I was hardly ever gonna have the opportunity to read something similar to it, but let me tell you, I did and it was thanks to Paula Hawkins. There were sometimes that I couldn't believe what I was reading, it has an original storyline that keeps your hearth pounding, gripping and wanting for more. I totally recommend it. Favorite Quotes:- “Life is not a paragraph, and death is no parenthesis.” -“I have never understood how people can blithely disregard the damage they do by following their hearts.” - “It's possible to miss what you’ve never had, to mourn for it.”-“The holes in your life are permanent. You have to grow around them, like tree roots around concrete; you mould yourself through the gaps.” -“I’ve been the fool. If he does it with you, he’ll do it to you.”"
1818,Paige Peploe,"If you're looking for a thriller, this should be your next choice. Holy crap. Couldn't put it down. "
1819,Rita,"Para uma opinião com mais pormenores estejam atentos ao meu canal: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1vl...Para começar este é um daqueles livros onde todas as personagens têm problemas... e são tão reais que eu tive pena da Rachel, das outras não tanto..Aborda temas como o alcoolismo , traição e maus tratos.Gostei muito do livro porque a autora tem algumas influências de Agatha Christie e como sabem eu considero-a a mãe dos mistérios e policiais e foi fantástico.Fiquei fascinada com o final pois não estava nada à espera do que aconteceu."
1820,Zoe De Pasquale,"""The Girl on the Train"" is a chillingly ominous psychological thriller as well as a character study of surprising depth, with Gillian Flynn levels of nail-biting narrative hooks. I haven't been compelled to turn page after page after page of a book for a long time, and I'm shocked to learn it's the author's debut. Kudos Paula Hawkins! The fact that it was published less than 3 weeks ago, is on its 8th printing and has had its rights optioned for a film already by DreamWorks, is information enough on the quality of this book - read it!"
1821,Melissa Pikul,"Thrilling! I might be slow but I had it all wrong! Quick read, I couldn't put it down."
1822,Spacious Critter,"5 stars for the performances as well as the well-spun yarn. Thoroughly enjoyable twisty turning story aptly symbolized by the corkscrew. Yes (snicker), you have to read it to find out what that means. At once pathetic and I also laughed my way round every turn, character collisions throughout, gone round self-deception and cleverly wrought murkings about until our sodden protagonist hits the big 'Aha!'. It was perfect for a heavy driving week. Hooray. Will definitely look up more titles by this author."
1823,Amanda Mottershead,"This book was wonderful. It completely captivated me and made me feel a full range of emotions. Rachel is a drunk. It is heart breaking. Almost from page one we see her struggling over her marriage that has long since been over. She does not have a job and is mortified about that fact. She takes the morning and evening trains so that her roommate believes she is going to and from work. Her train happens to pass her ex's street they used to live on. Instead of obsessing over watching his house. She watches a couple a few houses down that she names Jess and Jason in her head. They seem like the perfect happy couple to her. But things are not as they seem.One day ""Jess"" aka Megan goes missing. Rachel is desperate to be in the middle of the investigation as she's seen a man other than Megan's husband kissing her. She quickly turns into an unreliable witness, between the drinking and the stalking of her ex and his new wife.I had read a lot of reviews of this book over the past few months and I had read certain spoilers. Luckily I had forgotten what I had read and went in almost blind. The story is slow and is drawn out but oh so good. I didn't expect the twist at the end until about 80%. It wasn't exactly new or exciting, but I found it fitting for the situation. The story is told through three different point of views: Rachel, Megan, and Anna, Rachel's ex husbands new wife. I did not like Anna at all until the last few minutes of the story. I'm glad she turned a new leaf at the last second. Overall great story. I've heard there is a movie and I'll be watching soon. This definitely was similar to Gone Girl, but I found the unreliable narrator direction much more well thought out in the is one and the characters so much more likeable."
1824,Deidra,"I read this so fast because I couldn't stop reading it! It had me constantly thinking, and just when I thought I may have figured something out, I changed my mind. Its suspenseful and addicting! I liked it better than Gone Girl for sure."
1825,Çavlan,"4.5 stars. The Girl on the Train was one of the best thrillers I've read in the last couple of years. I guessed the identity of the killer very early on, but it was still a great ride. "
1826,~☆laura,"Wow what a book!!!! After hearing so many ppl rave about this book I had to buy it and see what the fuss was all about and boy am I glad I did, I completed this in literally a few hours from the first page I was hooked the plot kept me guessing and the characters kept me intrigued Rachel although very flawed drew me in I couldn't help but pity her and sympathise with her yet at the same time want to scream and shake some sense into her. Megan was another flawed person who I didn't particularly like but on occasion sympathised with her.Anna I admit I just didn't like at all she brought it on herself the only decent thing she ever did was right at the end when you found out what really transpired with the corkscrew.As for the men in this story I wont go into too much detail needless to say each had some secrets and involvement in what transpired. Also I'm not going to get into the plot too much as I don't want to give too much away but I will say this book did keep me guessing although I did guess alot of it I thought that this book was amazing definitely worth a read it kept me on the edge of the seat!!!!"
1827,Anastasia Cynthia,"“Satu berarti penderitaan, dua berarti kebahagiaan, tiga berarti bocah perempuan. Tiga berarti bocah perempuan. Aku tertahan pada tiga, aku tidak bisa melanjutkannya lagi. Kepalaku dipenuhi suara, mulutku dipenuhi darah. Tiga berarti bocah perempuan. Aku bisa mendengar burung-burung magpie itu, mereka tertawa, mengejekku, terkekeh parau. Ada kabar. Kabar buruk. Kini aku bisa melihat mereka, hitam dilatari matahari. Bukan burung-burung itu, tapi sesuatu yang lain. Seseorang datang. Seseorang bicara kepadaku. Kini lihatlah. Lihatlah apa yang terpaksa kulakukan karenamu.” —The Girl On The Train, hlm. 403
Rachel sudah menjadi seorang alkoholik selama bertahun-tahun. Kondisinya kian memburuk ketika Tom berselingkuh dan malah memilih wanita jalang itu. Keduanya memiliki seorang anak perempuan cantik. Dan menghuni rumah kesukaannya.Diam-diam ia memerhatikan rumah tetangganya dari atas kereta. Setiap pagi ia melintas dari Ashbury ke London; kereta yang ia tumpangi selalu berhenti di depan rumah bernomor lima belas. Jess dan Jason, pasangan kesukaannya akan bermesraan di halaman rumah. Rachel dirundung rasa iri. Membandingkan dirinya yang benar-benar kacau. Dan perempuan itu Megan—Jess—dan suaminya Scott—Jason—yang amat sempurna.Tapi, siapa sangka di balik sebuah kesempurnaan, nyatanya, Rachel sama sekali tidak mengetahui apa-apa. Pagi ketika ia terbangun dari tidur panjang sembari separuh pengar. Kabar itu terlansir. Megan Hipwell menghilang. Anna, si wanita jalang, menuduh Rachel sebagai salah satu yang terlibat.Rachel berkilah, sembari mencari jawaban. Ingatannya menguap, mencari kepingan dari insiden semalam. Malam ketika ia hendak mengunjungi Tom. Dan pulang dengan dalam keadaan berdarah-darah. Rachel memperhatikan Scott di balik kaca ruang interogasi Detektif Gaskill. Agaknya ia perlu mengalihkan kecintaannya akan alkohol pada hal lain.Ibarat frasa kuno, “mengintip rumput tetangga” sesungguhnya adalah poin utama yang ingin ditunjukkan oleh Paula Hawkins dalam “The Girl On The Train”. Jika sering kali seseorang mengecap dirinya sebagai sebuah kegagalan, lantas membanding-bandingkan dirinya dengan seseorang yang lebih sempurna, agaknya tidak ada orang yang sempurna di dunia ini. Seperti halnya Rachel yang salah menilai pasangan kesukaannya, Jess dan Jason. “The Girl On The Train” banyak bercerita tentang kegagalan sebuah pernikahan, yang mana suami dan istri silih bermain intrik dan mengelabui satu sama lain. Tuntutan berat bagi seorang istri yang harus memberikan keturunan bagi pohon keluarga mereka, malah tidak sanggup dipenuhi hingga berujung pada rasa frustasi. Semuanya terasa seperti lingkaran setan. Satu tindakan dapat menyebabkan sebuah dampak. Tidak hanya pada satu tokoh atau sebuah keluarga, tapi keluarga lainnya yang mau tak mau jadi ikut terlibat.Sedari awal, Paula Hawkins menceritakan kisah sedih Rachel Watson sebagai sebuah keseharian. Ada sedikit kejenuhan di bagian depan. Rachel selalu menaiki kereta yang sama setiap pagi. Dan selalu saja bersikap sentimentil terhadap dirinya. Kalimat-kalimat perkenal dibuat mengalir secara syahdu dan mendayu-dayu. Tapi, semua keganjilan yang ada pada dirinya tak lantas diungkapkan Paula Hakwins dalam satu untaian kalimat panjang. Semuanya bergerak perlahan. Rachel menyinggung banyak pihak yang patut ia salahkan, suaminya—Tom, si wanita jalang yang berhasil merebut suaminya, Anna. Dan bayi perempuan keparat itu, Evie. Rachel memilih mabuk seharian dan malah terpergok saat bekerja, hingga membuatnya dipecat dari pekerjaan.Baca selengkapnya di: https://janebookienary.wordpress.com/..."
1828,Kathleen,Wonderful debut novel. A thriller maybe even better than Gone Girl!
1829,Katherine,"I couldn't put this book down. I read it in two days, and started it over again as soon as I finished it."
1830,Kory,"OMG. I wasn't sure that I'd like this book because I haven't read a psychological thriller in a long time. At first it seemed mundane, yet I was only a handful of pages in... And then? Then the story shifted to another character's POV and I could see everything from that person's perspective. And then it shifted yet again, giving me glimpses into the lives of a variety of characters so that little by little I was allowed clues as to what was happening. This is a story of deception, the lies we tell ourselves and others, the way lines get blurred by emotions or alcohol, skeletons hidden in the closet, and the secrets that we keep. It's a story about how things aren't always what they seem, and Hawkins had me turning pages to find out who was up to what. The greatest part? Each time I decided I knew exactly what was going on, Hawkins led me down another path to make me question if what I believed was happening was the truth. This is a must-read book that will make you want to call in sick just so you can finish it! (Please note that I didn't use a sick day, but I read through lunch breaks and at every spare moment I had, desperate to discover the truth behind everything that happened to the girl on the train, and desperate to know who was going to survive the madness.)"
1831,Sim Carter,"I learned about the new best seller everybody's calling the new Gone Girl a few weeks back. After reading the freebie sample of Paula Hawkins The Girl on the Train on my Nook, I really wanted to get my hands on an actual hard copy of the page turner, so I could, you know, turn the pages. But the book was just published January 13th so it's still in hardback and at $23 has been flying off the shelves, selling like hotcakes, number one with a bullet on the New York Times Bestseller List, so I decided to download it to my Nook for just under ten bucks instead. I tore through it; it's hard not to, it's so nail-bitingly good. I wish I had the actual book though, speeding train on the cover and all, hanging around and cluttering up my bedside table to remind me, write it up, write it up, write it up.Here I am, finally getting around to it. The thing is, it's hard to write this one up; I don't want to ruin a second of the pleasure of your reading it, your nail chewing at the discoveries story moves forward and reveals itself. I always have this trouble with mysteries; not quite knowing what to say and what to keep back.Let's see, I can safely say it's about a 'girl' (why are we still calling women 'girls'?) who takes the train to and from London everyday, and who sees something from the train window. I can say the book was optioned by DreamWorks almost a year ago, long before its 2015 publication date, for producer Marc Platt to make into a film. I can say that he's already hired a screenwriter to work on the screenplay adaptation: Erin Cressida Wilson. I was hoping with a middle name like ""Cressida"" she'd be British because I think a writer with a British sensibility is less likely to say they can switch it to the Long Island Rail Road and have Rachel, the main character, taking the train to Manhattan from Long Island and back every day. Er, no thanks! Sadly, she's an American but both her parents were English teachers so hopefully she's got that built-in love and respect for the written word. Even when the written word isn't exactly Shakespeare, because while it's not literature with a capital L, it's very, very good, and as scary and unstoppable as a speeding train. You may have heard The Girl on the Train is a story with a marital problem or two, along with an 'unreliable' narrator. In truth, we have three narrators, Rachel, Megan and Anna. Reliable? Unreliable? That all depends on your point of view. And point of view is definitely much of the fun of this book.First, Rachel. She is the girl in The Girl on the Train, an alcoholic divorcee who takes the train into the city everyday, mesmerized by the small strip of homes that back the train tracks as she passes. As an old realtor like me can tell you, property that backs the train tracks looks a whole lot more desirable from the train, than it does from the backyard of those homes, the train whistle sounding day in, day out. Still, Rachel romanticizes the view from the train, and can't take her eyes off one attractive looking couple who spend a fair amount of time on their deck.""They are a perfect,golden couple. He is dark-haired and well built, strong, protective, kind. He has a great laugh. She is one of those tiny bird-women, a beauty, pale-skinned with blond hair cropped short. She has the bone structure to carry that kind of thing off, sharp cheekbones dappled with a sprinkling of freckles, a fine jaw."" p. 11Rachel, lonely and self-loathing, even fantasizes about the male member of the golden couple —""I can imagine the feel of his hands, the weight of them, reassuring and protective. Sometimes I catch myself trying to remember the last time I had meaningful physical contact with another person, just a hug or a heartfelt squeeze of my hand, and my heart twitches.""Reliable/Unreliable? She's an alcoholic, hiding her drinking, constantly going off and on the wagon. She was as frustrating to me as a couple of alcoholics I've known in my own life, making futile promises they're not ready to keep. How can you take anything they seriously? Does she invent, misremember? It really is difficult to take her point of view at face value. Unreliable at best, I still found myself rooting for her, wanting to shake her, stop her from doing what I could see she was about to do.Megan, the perfect blonde woman Rachel sees from the train is not exactly the woman Rachel imagines her to be. Not beneath the surface. The Megan we meet, one year earlier, is much less satisfied with the life she's living than Rachel imagines. In fact they're not all that different. Megan indulges in fantasy and wishful thinking too, pretending she's living in a pretty house in the Cinque Terre—which must also rattle as the train whistles past—and not here in this suburban strip of homes. She's married yes, but she's adrift, unemployed, unsatisfied—she is, in fact, seeing a shrink.""My days feel empty now I don't have the gallery to go to any longer. I really miss it. I miss talking to the artists. I even miss dealing with all those tedious yummy mummies who used to drop by, Starbucks in hand, to gawk at the pictures, telling their friends that little Jessie did better pictures than that in nursery school.""p. 23Lastly there is Anna who we hear a lot about from both Rachel and Megan, but don't hear anything from until we're a third of the way through the novel. Anna used to be a real estate agent (me too!) but now she's a seemingly happily married stay-at-home mother to an adorable baby girl. She lives in the same strip of homes back the tracks.""On days like today, with the sun shining, when you walk down our little street—tree-lined and tidy, not quite a cu-de-sac, but with the same sense of community—it could be perfect. Its pavements are busy with mothers just like me, with dogs on leads and toddlers on scooters. It could be ideal. It could be, if you weren't able to hear the screeching brakes of the trains.""p. 100Three women, all about the same age—late twenties, early thirties—living (trapped?) in suburbia. Three intersecting stories and it all begins with Rachel. When Rachel sees what she sees from the train window, we follow her muddied thinking, her cloudy vision to find out the truth. I couldn't stop reading, it was like a magnet just kept me attached to the page, pulling me along and along. I'm not going to tell you any more. It really is too good of a read.I'm already thinking about the casting.Rachel, the drinker, once a dark haired beauty is called 'fat', bloated from drink and her depressive personality. I doubt she's fat in any truly obese way, but she sees herself that way. She's probably 10 or possibly 20 pounds overweight, out of control and unhappy. Someone like Martine McCutcheon who played Natalie in Love Actually, except not as ebullient and comfortable in her own skin!Megan and Anna are both pretty, petite blondes. Carey Mulligan, Joanne Froggat, Emilia Clarke come to mind.Joanne Froggatt (Downton Abbey) seen here as Lexie in The Secret BBC television seriesCarey Mulligan in DriveAs for the menRachel tells us that Megan's husband is""handsome in a British film star kind of way, not a Depp or a Pitt, but a Firth, or a Jason Isaacs.""Thanks for doing the work for us Rachel! Is Colin Firth too old? NEVER! But if you disagree, then who would you put in his place?And Megan tells us Anna's husband 'flashes his Tom Cruise smile.' So why not Tom Cruise? Did you see him opposite Emily Blunt in The Edge of Tomorrow? He was fantastic, as was the film! Too old? Again I say, who would you pick? Chris Hemsworth? Chris Pines?Then there's Megan's yummy shrink —""His name is Dr. Kamal Abdic. I guess he must be midthirties, although he looks very young with his incredible dark honey skin.""No question about this one. That sounds like Sendhil Ramamurthy from the television series Beauty and the Beast to me!URGGHH! UPDATE: While I love the women cast in the film: Emily Blunt as Rachel, Rebecca Ferguson as Anna and Haley Bennet as Megan, I’m distressed at the rumored casting of Chris Evans as Tom and Jared Leto as Megan’s husband, Scott. And I’m really ticked that they’ve relocated the setting to NYC! This is a train, this girl wants to get off!Have you read the book yet? Who would you cast as The Girl on the Train?"
1832,Briley Petersen,"The concept of this book was extremely clever. Totally original and well played out. There were a couple of things that I wish the author had taken into consideration. I believe it would be almost impossible to have a baby and have virtually no one know about it. That part was an important part of the story, but wasn't believable at all. That the main character was an alcoholic was a daring and brilliant thing to do. It made her completely untrustworthy and a bit unlikable, but still, she was telling the truth the whole time. Definitely a worthwhile read. "
1833,Andrea Eklund,"Fast-paced read. Once I got into the story, I couldn't put it down. "
1834,Lane,"For the moment I'm giving this 5 stars, but in the light of day I might rethink that. It's not a great book, after all. It's just a great read.A lot of people compare it to Gone Girl, and it's similar only in the sense that it's narrated by multiple characters, and it's hard to know how much to trust what they say. But this was so much more satisfying to read. I enjoyed every page and didn't get pissed off the way I did when I'd finished Gone Girl.I can't imagine that this won't get made into a movie, and I'll be looking forward to seeing it."
1835,Anika,"I don't often read thrillers and maybe that's why I loved this one so much.NOW SPOILERS***All the while Rachel is portrayed to be the faulty one and the one who is at fault. There were moments when I believed she did kill Megan. I didn't want to believe it, but it would have added up. Then I thought maybe it was Scott after all. Hell, I even thought it could have been Rachel! On the other hand, the affair between Megan and Tom didn't come as a surprise at all. Tom's psychopathic behavior on the other hand did. In the end, of course, it all makes perfect sense. The way he's acting and the way he never really does let go of Rachel and still tries to be her knight in shining armour (his words after all).What I love most about this in the end is how Rachel's addiction is the most obvious one. But they all are addicted to or obsessed with something. And all of these addictions are taking them down a path of destruction. Like a train, really, which always has a (final) destination. "
1836,Anca,"It's 3.45 a.m and i just finished this book. I know this review will probability upload when i have better internet conection, maybe in the morning. I'm a mess. This book was like a rollercoaster and i loved every part of it. First of all, I really liked the fact that this book was realistic. Rachel's addiction, her fears, Megan's and Scott's life, Anna's thoughts on Rachel and her behaviour. I had 25 pages left of this book when i realized no one is the true hero of the story. I found myself shocked when we found out about Scott, because he seemed like the good guy in the story, with only a couple of issues. The most normal out of everyone.When we find out about Tom's second affair, it clicked. I suddenly knew that Tom's the bad guy, and for some reason I had a really bad feeling about him. It couldn't be just a simple affair. I started to think that 'woah, so many women are after Tom' and that somehow, all of them ended up bad. Anna was starting to follow Rachel's lead and I think that is the moment when i realized.At times, i was annoyed with Rachel because she just couldn't give up drinking but I guess it it the sad, realistic true to the world detail.Even though Rachel's perspective made me hate Anna, her actions, contacting officer Riley, feeling watched and not having a general good experience in that house are normal things, and I would react the same. I would fear for my child,knowing the fact that the unstable ex wife of my husband tried to take it. After all the harassing with the calls and the fights with Rachel I would do the same thing Anna did. And this is another thing I loved about the book. The fact that even though in the start, she is supposedly the bad wolf, it is because thats how Rachel saw it. But, it made me despise Anna because she did some of those things because she didnt care about Rachel perspective. I adored the kind of methapor the author did, with Jess and Jason, and Scott and Megan. If people saw them from the ouside, they would think that they were the exact perfect couple Rachel told us about on the train. But in reality,there are a lot of secrets, a lot of tragedy and pain. I think that happens in real life too, because we think something of people, judging on some moments we saw, not knowing the whole truth.I loved the ending. I somehow knew from the beginning that it's going to end with Rachel having to catch the train. And I was really pleased when it happened."
1837,Ance,"Noslēpumi, kuriem mēs patraucamies garām milzu ātrumā, tos pat nemanot, var glabāt katastrofas potenciālu.Es izlasu tikai dažas noziegumu mistērijas gadā. Es esmu uz tām izvēlīga, viegli viļos, ja noslēpumu var uzminēt par ātru, ja tēli ir pārlieku ""plakani"", vienvārdsakot, kaprīza freilene.Bet atverot šo, cik zīmīgi, vilcienā pa ceļam, sapratu — nevarēšu lasīt to pa gabaliņam, saraustīti. Šis ir ""āķis lūpā"" materiāls.Un tā arī bija, lieliska debija. ""Gone Girl"" var iet atpūsties, there's a new girl in the town.Tikai viena piezīme: par galveno ""ļaunīti"" es labprāt būtu uzzinājusi vairāk. Bet šis sīkums nav tā vērts, lai atņemtu šai grāmatai zvaigzni."
1838,Jade Wright,"The Girl on the Train is absolutely riveting! Told in chunks by three women all somehow connected, the story revolves around a murder. A murder of one of the three women. Rachel is an alcoholic who's lost her job, her husband and her dignity. She travels back and forth to London every day, watching the world whizz by around her along the way. Then one day while looking out at a particular house she witnesses something terrible.Megan is hard to describe. Throughout the book she kept on surprising me. She definitely isn't the person you think she is - with a shady past and some serious skeletons in her closet you just never know what she's going to do next. Anna is a mother and a wife. Her husband, Tom, is Rachel's ex husband. Anna is constantly paranoid because her family keeps getting harassed by Rachel. It's as though Rachel just won't let go of the fact that her husband has moved on. When the murder happens and the investigation begins, things become extremely messy for all three women. I couldn't put this book down. It is staggeringly perfect. Mysterious, thrilling, dark and delightful. "
1839,Claire,"The Girl on the Train has already received amazing advanced praise from reviewers all over the world and I have to say that I really enjoyed it too. I won't be surprised if this book does exceptionally well in 2015. Rachel gets the same train every day to work and every day it stops at the same signal. Rachel loves peering into the garden of the house it stops at and imagining the life of the perfect couple who lives there. Until one day, she sees something that shatters this illusion and she gets drawn into a terrifying chain of events. I was interested in this book because it had been likened to the book Gone Girl, which I enjoyed very much. And yes, there are similarities between The Girl on the Train in its storyline, style of writing and the way it keeps you guessing until the end. The characters were built up very well and there are chapters that are dedicated to three of the main women in the story. You do have to pay attention to the dates of each chapter as well though, which I didn't and got a little bit confused at times, but as long as you're on the ball it's quite easy to work out where you are in the story. I loved this book and I would certainly recommend it. It kept me guessing and kept me hooked. And the ending came as a surprise to me as well - I certainly wasn't expecting it. I had been missing a good thriller/mystery book in my life this year and I think I have finally found it. I was lucky enough to be given an advanced reading copy from the publishers through Netgalley and Girl on the Train will be released on 15th January 2015."
1840,Machel,"Read on a luxury train in Canada on vacation. I must say, the most fun I have had reading a book in awhile. I can see why this book is off the charts on buzz and bestselling lists. Paula Hawkins first novel filled my mind with dread, hope, and curiosity as I road along on the Rocky Mountaineer in Canada. The characters were real and tangible. The motion of the train felt like a character in the book as well. I was asked at lunch in the dining car by my traveling fab four family who my favorite actress is, and I said: Emily Blunt. I was ecstatic when I finished the book and read online that she is starring in the film adaptation, but also disappointed they are moving the location to New York. I loved the London aspect of it and those London residents on the train. I look forward to her next book. Thank you Paula Hawkins for awaking me back into the fiction genre. I have been reading much non-fiction this year and also been writing a lot myself, so just a joy to lose myself in a G-R-E-A-T BOOK"
1841,Amy Nau,"Took a minute to get me hooked, but I couldn't put it down by the end."
1842,Guy,This novel has been compared to Gone Girl which I really enjoyed. I may even have liked this one a tiny bit better. The girl on the train is one of three female narrators. I like the device of the train because the story rushes along like a train speeding down a track if that isn't too corny.Reading this novel was for me like assembling a jig saw puzzle. OK here's a bit of information ie a puzzle piece. And it seems to fit here. And here's another. And I'm three quarters through the book and the picture has yet to appear.We do learn that a murder has been committed. A girl's body has been found. One of the three narrators in fact. And eventually I did stumble upon the truth. But not until a number of false assumptions and blind alleys and pieces that I tried to force into places they didn't belong.In the end all was revealed and it all made sense. A very satisfying psychological thriller that I felt was deserving of the critical praise it has received. I thoroughly enjoyed the ride.
1843,Hissa Reads ,"I LOVED, ENJOYED AND RELISHED IT. So I have just finished this book and the reason why it took me forever to finish it; though it was a very short book, is because I got into a reading slump. Sad right? But even though I got into a reading slump the book, and the characters were always in my head, yes I wasn't reading it, but I was thinking about it 24/7. The multiple protagonists is not something I usually like, but in this book I truly loved it. And also the multiple protagonists were so messed up and crazy in different ways that I was always looking up to read from their point of view.I'm not good at solving crimes apparently, because I didn't see that coming! Like at all. But I have always hated him. /people who read the book will know who am I talking about./ ..If you're wondering about this book, I assure you it's not a waste of time. Go and pick it, and enjoy the thrill of it. "
1844,Britta Kavanagh,"I just finished this yesterday and can't stop thinking about how much I liked it. The last book I read that was compared to Gone Girl was a dire disappointment so I was wary about this and the surrounding hype. But not only was this a gripping read that got me hooked as much as Gone Girl, I also found myself caring about most of the characters much more.I was rooting for Rachel despite her maddening flaws and thought she was a much more likeable character than anything I had read about the book had made be expect. I also despised Anna with a passion, which for a writer really is as much of an achievement as making you like someone.Adding to that the genuinely satisfying twists and turns (even the foreseeable ones felt kind of surprising somehow) and the cracking, entertaining read, I can only recommend this to anyone who enjoys a well written psychological thriller and to some who just like to read a good book."
1845,Nikayla Steinmetz,"The Girl on the Train is everything anyone could ever want in a mystery and more! This book had me hooked from the start and I could NOT put it done. The book is told from the perspectives of three women who all have one big thing in common, you will have to read the book in order to find out what that thing is. Rachel tells a good portion of the story, she is divorced and can't seem to move on from her past life with her husband, did I mention she is also an alcoholic? She takes a train everyday of the week to and from her ""job"", on this ride she likes to look out at the houses it passes, especially number 23. In number 23 is a happy looking couple she calls Jason and Jess, Rachel doesn't know those are their names though and she has never even spoken to them yet she feels a bond with them. One day when the train is passing number 23 Rachel sees something that changes how she sees Jason and Jess forever, soon after this sighting Jess goes missing. Rachel's world spirals even more out of control and soon she tries to get involved with Jess's disappearance. Soon Rachel becomes connected with Jason and Jess in ways she never thought possible. Rachel has to become stronger in order to remember the truth because when she remembers everything will change for her, forever. So obviously I loved this book! The plot kept thickening and thickening making it impossible for me to put it down. Every time I thought I had this one figured out Hawkins would throw me a curveball and I'd be heading back to the dugout. Every single character in this book is majorly flawed with something such as being an alcoholic, abuser, cheater or even a psychotic mom. This is also a set of characters that you love to hate, I hated them all! I mean at times I liked Rachel, but then she would go do something stupid and I'd get angry all over again. This is has easily become my favorite mystery. So happy I picked this gem up!"
1846,Paris Baker,"Originally posted on Paris Baker's Book Nook.Wow. This was an incredibly unsettling book - and I mean that in the best possible way.The narrative is split between 3 women: Rachel, Anna and Megan.The story is mainly from Rachel's viewpoint, the girl on the train. Spurned by her ex-husband, Tom, who now lives a seemingly cosy life with his new wife (and former mistress), Anna, and their young daughter, Rachel has sought solace at the bottom of a bottle, and her life has taken a nose dive in recent years. With everything in tatters around her, Rachel takes comfort in the routine of her daily journey to and from London on the train. She watches the houses and people she passes, as many people do, and has even started to make up names and lives for some of them, particularly 'Jason and Jess.' She has built up a perfect life for this couple - carefree and in love, and all the things her and Tom were meant to be.When she witnesses something that starts to shatter the fantasy she has built, Rachel is deeply disturbed and, unable to let things lie, finds herself getting involved. But with drunken blackouts and hazy memories both commonplace in Rachel's life, she's not exactly a reliable or trustworthy witness. Paula has done a truly fantastic job with Rachel's character as protagonist. She is unpredictable and unreliable, she possesses multiple undesirable traits, and yet I couldn't help finding her somewhat endearing. There's a sort of earnest about, so that even when I wasn't sure I could trust her, I was willing her to be right, to be honest and to be acting with the best intentions.Anna just wants to settle into her new life with husband and baby without any interference from Tom's ex-wife, who won't leave him alone, and Megan's life isn't quite as perfect as it may outwardly seem.There is not a single character in the plot who you can altogether trust, and I found my loyalty was constantly shifting throughout the story, as more information was slowly filtered in - some seemingly helpful and some making you question everything you'd thought thus far. Either way, it had me greedily reading each page as quickly as possible to find out what happened, raising the questions: what happens behind closed doors? who doesn't have secrets? who can you really trust? and when you're losing your memory to alcohol-induced amnesia, can you even trust yourself?This book was marvellously mysterious, with a thrilling increase of pace throughout as the tension increased. A must read for the psychological thriller lover - easily set to be the Gone Girl of 2015."
1847, (Lúa),"Me ha acabado encantando. Tenia las expectativas muy altas y no sabia si iba a terminar gustándome, pero la verdad es que me ha tenido enganchada durante horas (3 horas sin mentiros).Me ha gustado mucho la pluma de la autora y como ha llevado a cabo y logrado mantener la intriga sobre el asesinato. Hasta las últimas páginas no hubiera podido saber quien y que pasaba. No suelo leer muchos thrillers pero este me ha encantado. Quizás no es TAN exageradamente bueno para el boom que tuvo pero me ha gustado mucho. Lo más importante es que me ha mantenido atrapada entre sus páginas, no he sabido que ocurría hasta que la misma autora me lo ha desvelado y además, la autora describe muy bien y ha habido ocasiones (al final) en las que hasta tenía yo más miedo que las propias protagonistas. Muy recomendable :) Empezamos bien este 2016!!"
1848,Marylene,"The author did a really good job with keeping the reader guessing on what's happening throughout the whole book. This book made me want to read just one more chapter, just one more chapter. Im not a quick reader, but this one kept me interested enough to read as much as i could with the time available. I would reccommend this book to anyoneand everyone! "
1849,Nicola,"Ooh, I did enjoy this!To be read in one or two sittings if time allows, or in the dead of night while all is quiet around. The first 30 or so pages take a while to work out what’s going on, but from then on in the pace is relentless and you have a proper potboiler on your hands. Reminded me of “Before I Go to Sleep” and “Just What Kind of Mother are You”, also great page-turners.The use of the varied first-person narrative ensures you are constantly wrong-footed, and the use of a protagonist who drinks more than she ought is such a clever technique. Best to swept along by it and not try too hard to guess ‘who-done-what’. Am sure it irritated the socks off some readers, but it’s a fresh take on the thriller, and having a neurotic alcoholic as anti-heroine does work brilliantly within the frame and plot of the story (there are a couple of scenes depicted that ring home and are a bit too close to the bone – oh the perils of having that extra glass…).Read full review at literary ramblings etc"
1850,Nicole,"An amazing debut novel definitely worth the hype! All though I heard a lot of hype about this book no reviews I watched gave anything away about the plotand I wasn't even sure if it was more of a horror or a crime/thriller/mystery. I think it's best to go in without knowing much or with any expectations.The writing style/format ***** This helps set up a rhythm and makes it even more of a page-turnerCharacters *****No one was perfect. There is nothing I find more aggravating then reading a book where all the protagonists are perfect, flawless characters. It stops them from being relatable and everyone makes mistakes and everyone has flaws, I am yet to meet someone who doesn't. This book perfectly portrayed all the narrators and other characters, it meant that we didn't know who to trust, who we liked, who we didn't. I didn't figure anything out, Paula Hawkins definitely got me! There was a short point in the story where I got ""pretty close"" to the reveal but it was completely wrong still and after I read on a bit it completely took me on another thought trail. Plot and pacing *****Fantastic! I won't talk about the plot because I really don't want to give anything away, all I will say is enjoy! There are quite a few darker moments and topics that this book touches on, so there may be some trigger warnings for readers but I don't want to go into them in case of spoilers - I still do highly recommend this book however and if you are a bit cautious about triggers and this book please feel free to ask me and I'll go into more info without spoiling as much as possible. "
1851,Bill Kupersmith,"That arch-cad Sir James Goldsmith is supposed to have remarked: 'When you marry your mistress you create a job vacancy.' That's an observation one character in Girl on the Train should have kept in mind. Most of the time I'm disappointed by the latest book ballyhooed towards the box office. Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl was hugely overrated - we connoisseurs of the outré preferred Sharp Objects & S. J. Watson’s Before I Go to Sleep was - appropriately - even more yawn-inducing au cinema than on the page. But Paula Hawkins utterly captivated me with Girl on the Train.With different voices for the three narrators, it was ideal as a travelling audio book. Each spoke a middle class dialect but with subtle gradations - does one say du-vay or du-vee? Rachel sounded poshest, appropriate because her mother seems to have some money. She is the title & principal character & I identified totally with her & well understand what it feels like to be so sensitive to embarrassing situations where we might be criticised or rejected as to go to absurd lengths to avoid them. The therapist (himself a suspect) she consults, ought to have spotted Avoidant Personality Disorder & had her try Propananol. (We chaplains all think we are brilliant diagnosticians:) Rachel commutes by train into London every day lest her landlady/roommate find out Rachel's been sacked for drunkenness. Like Rachel, I know what it's like to use alcohol to assuage the pain of failed relationships, & like her I am a people-watcher who imagines stories about them. Rachel is a lot like some of Helen Fitzgerald's principal characters, but with a more tragic flavour. Like Fitzgerald’s characters, Rachel’s 1st response to an awkward situation is lying - not out of any effort to deceive but to avoid appearing foolish. Unfortunately when she attempts to ‘come forward’ - I’ve always wondered ‘forward’ to where? - is it near the ‘aside’ you step to when you’re surplus to requirements & the ‘on’ where you’re supposed to move to when you’re dumped, as Rachel was by her ex-husband Tom? When she goes to the police she’s labelled a drunk & a fantasist. Besides having seen the victim kissing a strange man the day she disappeared, Rachel thinks she also may have been in the neighbourhood that same night, but being subject to blackouts Rachel can recall but a few hazy details. The reader wants to scream ‘Stop lying!’ @ Rachel - ultimately the best way to deal with embarrassment is going flat out with the truth & leaving the lying to the sociopaths - there’s @ least one in this book as well as an unpleasant & incompetent cop.The other narrators are Megan, the victim, & Anna, Rachel’s ex’s current & mother of his child. I found Megan darkly attractive (being from King’s Lynn helped). She’s very unlike the happy golden girl Rachel imagined - an ex-15y/o-wild-child with a literal skeleton in her past & like Rachel extremely needy but her weakness is not ETOH but sex. I expect most of us will dislike Anna, but she’s wonderfully drawn & believable & the voice her reader gives us is priceless - her pronunciation of Merlot pegs her perfectly.For me the difference between a four & five star book is that the former provides several hours of stimulating & innocuous pleasure but the latter also alters, @ least in a small way, who I am & how I see the world. Girl on the Train did that for me. I read these books not only to find the solution to the mystery, but for the characters & relationships & moral & spiritual values. Here they all work together to bring about a very satisfying ending."
1852,Cath,"This book disturbed me greatly - more than a read has for a long time. I've actually felt quite unsettled and discontented during the four days it has taken me to read and finish. I'm not sure whether that means I should have rated it a one or a five.The opening pages of Rachel's life were something I could relate to in an alarming way - the loneliness, lack of direction, feeling of failure and not belonging mixed with the commute and crowds of London is certainly a journey I have been through both literally and figuratively. I had my Jess and Jason, and wonderful stories based on certain houses as I passed twice a day. As each female character was explored further the similarities to my own life was un-nerving and quite uncomfortable. With the modern family being geographically disjointed, and the reliance on friends, what happens to all three female characters is plausible - in fact scarily so.I loved the writing style, and the twists, and will be reading Hawkins' next novel the minute it is out this summer."
1853,Artemisia Hunt,"I don't often read murder mysteries, but when I do I like ones that are riveting and perfectly paced, without extraneous tangents or predictable conclusions. The Girl on the Train fit these requirements beautifully. Add to that, fully imagined characters, a plot that would make a spellbinding movie, and imagery that befits the mood and authentic feel of the storyline, and you've got the perfect murder mystery."
1854,Megan Tiscareno,"For the fans of Gone Girl-esque type stories, you will thoroughly enjoy The Girl on the Train. Told in revolving narrators, you really explore this twisted and suspenseful story. "
1855,Sue1958,"	First let me say, there has been so much hype about this book I put off reading it for a few weeks. I suppose I was reluctant to read it seeing as a book buddy of mine said she was struggling with it. I know we have similar tastes in books usually.When something is hyped up so much you tend to have your expectations so high that it fails to be met by the time you get around to reading it [or if its a film....watching it]This is primarily a story of three individual women. Rachel takes the front row I think, she is the Girl on the Train. She is used to travelling back and forth on the train to work. The passes the home where she used to live with her ex. Now her ex is with someone else.Once I got used to each chapter being written under the guise of each person, made a note of the date of the heading of each chapter in my head it all sort of came into play really. First it was really like travelling on a train.....slowly at the start, then you get right into the experience and you don't want to get off! This is how I felt about reading this.What I loved about this story was, it was different. Paula Hawkins and a well thought out story here that keeps you travelling onwards. I really couldn't get off the wreckage of this storyline, the twist at the end was good, really good. Because of reading so many books each year, once in a while you get a book that really stands out from all the others, and this is the one. What a wonderful start to my reading experiences for the New Year of 2015.By the way, the concept to it being compared to Gone Girl, don't you believe it, its nothing like it! This is brilliant in its own right.I would like to thank Random House UK, Transworld Publishers Via Net Galley for the opportunity to read such an excellent book "
1856,Kristin Herrera,"There are too few and at the same time too many words to describe how amazingly engaging and enthralling this book is. I love being sucked into a book from the start and this one did that, for sure. I couldn't put it down and hated to see it end. I'm both sad and excited that this is Paula Hawkins' first novel. Sad because I'd be starting another of her books right now if there was one, but ecstatic at the thought that she is ""new"". I can only hope she has more in the works, because this was hands-down one of the most intriguing and captivating books I've ever read."
1857,June Louise,"I had heard so many enthusiastic reviews about this novel, both on Booktube and on here that I decided to see for myself if it matched the hype. I'm not really a contemporary fiction fan, my genre being the classics and the nineteenth century, but I have to say, I haven't enjoyed a book as much as this in ages. I literally could not put it down, so much so that I managed to put sugar in the curry sauce for dinner instead of salt! It is THAT gripping. The polyphonic narratives from Rachel, Megan, and Anna almost take the form of police statements, as if the reader is part of a jury to whom they are relating events, times of events, particular details; this narrative bringing to mind the type used by Wilkie Collins in The Woman In White, also a suspense/murder/crime novel but from the last century. The plot line twists and turns, unlike the straightness of a typical railway line - trains and railways playing a large part in the setting of this novel, and I have to say, the ending made me actually YELL at the characters involved..... I won't say any more in case of spoilers. Suffice to say, I am exhausted! Phew!Fantastic book, highly recommended! I'm going to be raving about this one for weeks on my blog!"
1858,Sam Abney,"
 ""There's something comforting about the sight of strangers safe at home."" 
And with those words, Paula Hawkins begins a rewardingly harrowing journey which oftentimes barrels ahead at a pace matching that of the train protagonist Rachel Watson takes daily. Her journey is one that is difficult to read and uncomfortable at times but making it all the way to the final station with her is a rewarding experience.As a summary, the book follows Rachel Watson (primarily, although there are two other narrators as well) who is a (recovering?) alcoholic riding the train in and out of London every day. As she passes by the homes she used to live in, she becomes fascinated by one couple she sees out on their terrace almost daily--the Hipwells, Scott and Megan--who she begins to become attached to from afar. After Megan goes missing, Rachel takes it upon herself to do everything she can to help the police investigate the disappearance and suspected murder of this woman she has developed a strong emotional attachment to. Along the way, Rachel has to deal with her ex-husband Tom Watson and his new wife, Anna (who is a real bitch if you ask me), while trying not to lose herself to her own demons.
""I have lost control over everything, even the places in my head.""
Before I even picked up this book, people kept telling me that is was very similar to Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl. While I love Flynn's seminal work, I would have to disagree with the overall characterization of the books as being these sort of ""sister novels."" The similarities are surface-level at best (there's a murder investigation and the books utilize multiple unreliable narrators) and don't really reflect the deeper themes and/or structure of the tales. Hawkins' tale is told with a much more broken timeline due to Rachel's status as an alcoholic. We, as readers, only become aware of events when she herself is able to sort out her memories from the black booze-filled haze to which she lost them.I never really liked any of the narrators (Rachel, Megan and, unfortunately, Anna). This isn't because of anything that Hawkins did in her writing. In fact, each character is written very fully and distinctly. But at the end of the day they are all just bad people. It is oftentimes painful to read Rachel's portions of the book (of which there are many) because her life is on a constantly downward spiral. Just when you think things can't get worse for her, they can and they do. Anna does nothing to help Rachel's situation, as she is constantly paranoid that the ever-unhinging Rachel is hanging around her family a little too much. In Anna's defense, she did show much more character development than I had anticipated. I expected her to simply be ""the other woman"" but she became so much more. Megan, however, is never really made anything more than an ideal. This is partly because of her place in the narrative. I don't get a feel for her as much as I do the other characters but she is still delightfully readable and perhaps has the most plot development in her sections so it is forgivable that she is sometimes not as fleshed out. That's also probably because she has the least amount of narration in the novel.
""I have never understood how people can blithely disregard the damage they do by following their hearts.""
The themes Miss Hawkins touches on during her novel are commonplace for a thriller: trust, love, family, etc. The only theme that really seemed odd was this ever-creeping undertone of children being sort of ""life-ruiners"" to the women in this book. Rachel wanted a child, couldn't have one, and thus plummeted into a pit of depression and alcoholism. Anna didn't really want a child, and while she enjoys it more and more as the book goes on, she seems almost content to attribute her having a child to the creation of many of her current problems. Megan never saw herself as a good mother and has deep emotional scars from previous child care experiences. At the end of the day, I don't think any of it was Hawkins saying that children are bad in any sense. The striking negative impacts that all of these children (or a lack thereof) had on their mother's lives was simply something that struck me while reading.In summation, I adored every word in Hawkins' novel. The writing was fast paced and exciting. The story felt unique even if I did predict the plot twist about halfway through (there are a few lines that if you really pay attention to you can figure it out even earlier). The characters, despite not being likable (which part of me enjoys), were fleshed out and enthralling to watch even at their most painful times. The dialogue felt real. The structure was magnificent. If there is one book you read in 2015, it should be this one. With a verve for creative storytelling, Hawkins has crafted a unique experience which takes you on a train ride barreling forward at speeds unmatched which are guaranteed to excite and thrill any reader who is a fan of the thriller genre.Favorite Quotation: 
""I am interested, for the first time in ages, in something other than my own misery. I have purpose. Or at least, I have a distraction.""
"
1859,Pat Herndon,"Wow. If you like a face paced psychological thriller with twists and turns along the way, this one is for you. The lives of three women become inescapably tangled in his dark tale. Yes, maybe two thirds in I knew who the bad guy was....but the way the scenes played out kept me turning pages. This is one of those books that reads like a screen play. I was trying to imagine settings and which American city could be substituted for an American film version. "
1860,Melody Smith,"I am tired of every book being compared to Gone Girl. Twisted plots and scheming dialogue existed before Gillian Flynn. Don't get me wrong, I love her work but it isn't the bar for all others to be measured against. Having said that, I LOVED this book. I like books that reveal slowly and keep you guessing and nothing beats that ""ah ha"" moment when you figure out where they are going and then just hang on for the ride. "
1861,Kamana,"Yep, this book has managed to keep me up till late on a week night. And yep, I'm bobbing my head up and down in agreement with all the 5 star reviews out there. It definitely gets my vote for the best psycho-thriller category of books that I've read so far."
1862,Susie Butcher,Brilliant debut novel! Could barely put it down...
1863,Pechiyappan Muthukumar,"Holy, holy crap. The best thriller of the decade . If not for A Little Life, I would have called it the best book of the year. Startling story telling. Bewitching. Amazing. I could pour all the superlatives I know to describe the book and still it wouldn't be enough. Its THAT good! The psychological /hypnotic angle that never worked for me in the Fight club, seamlessly works here. I randomly started reading this book out of a huge collection of books I had because I saw an article about the two books getting confused: The girl on the train and The girl on a train. Apparently, the girl on a train sold a great number of copies because everyone thought that it was this book! I had zero expectations and just wanted to see what all the fuss was about. But when I finished the first page, there was no way I would've been able to put it down.I've read so many commercial Sidney Sheldon type books known for their master story telling,but Paula Hawkins' Train makes them seem like kiddy rides.The book also makes some great points: Never judge an alcoholic, Never judge anyone who doesn't comply by the society's standards of being ""normal"", Etc...The attention to detail whenever she travels in the train is astonishing. The ending was very satisfying, just to see the evil gone. Very few books can take you on a roller coaster ride of emotions in sync with the narration. This is one of them. In almost every page, we think ""Oh,don't do that Rachel"". But still, she has our sympathy. The plot may not be as sophisticated as it may seem, but it doesn't matter in the due course.Whatever she writes next, I would blindly buy. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys thrillers. Thank me later!"
1864,Yvette,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It started out a bit slow and then built to an exciting conclusion!
1865,Nathan,Thrilling. Seriously.
1866,Stephani Fannin,"Fans of Gone Girl have to read this book! Its unsolved mystery, unreliable narrators, and cliffhanger chapters leave readers frustrated, guessing, and longing to know what's real and what isn't. The main character and narrator, Rachel, is an alcoholic whose life is in shambles. Every day, she rides the train from Ashbury to Euston where she takes a particular interest in looking in on the life of a young married couple whose home lies directly next to the railroad tracks. Whenever she sees them out on their back patio, Rachel loves to imagine who they are and fascinates about the perfect life they must have together. However, on the same day the woman from this married couple goes missing, Rachel wakes up with a terrible hangover and the horrible feeling that she witnessed something horrible the night before. This is an amazing thriller and quick read!"
1867,ABO,"Jenis buku yang akan membuatmu rela mengorbankan jam tidurmu biar bisa lanjut baca sampe kelar. Harus diakui gaya penceritaannya bikin nggak bisa berenti baca.Saya setuju kalau buku ini dibilang perpaduan antara Gone Girl dan Before I Go to Sleep. Sedikit banyak memang mengingatkan pada dua buku tersebut (in a good way).Dari awal sampai pertengahan cerita, saya makin penasaran dengan siapa penjahat sebenarnya. Tapi, pas penulis mulai membocorkan banyak clue yang mengarah ke sana sampai ke endingnya saya agak sedikit kecewa sih. The story turned out to be cheesy. Saya pikir endingnya akan sekeren Gone Girl .__.Saya jadi penasaran dengan versi terjemahannya nanti. Karena kan salah satu daya pikat buku ini adalah ""she/he/her/him"" yang digunakan oleh penulisnya biar bikin pembaca bingung. Kalau diterjemahkan jadi ""dia/nya"" bakalan rancu nggak ya? Eh iya, selain temanya, yang mirip antara Gone Girl dan buku ini adalah pesan moralnya:1. Kenali pasanganmu baik-baik sebelum menikahinya2. Perselingkuhan itu buruk. Tapi akibat yang ditimbulkan bisa jadi lebih buruk.5 bintang saya dedikasikan buat gaya bercerita penulisnya."
1868,Thetwistedbookcurmudgeon,"5 Cranky Stars!A friend of mine recommended reading The Girl on the Train and it's been on my TRB list for some time. Last week, I went to Scotland with my husband and I spotted the book on the shelves. Quite often, books with rave reviews leaves me disappointed, but this is not one of them. I finished the book in almost one sitting (if you count the different planes, trains, and automobiles).Rachel takes the train into London every morning, passing the house she used to live in with her ex-husband, Tom. He's remarried now to Anna, the woman he cheated on Rachel with, and they have a child. Rachel washes away her grief and pain with alcohol. A few houses down live a couple who fascinate Rachel. She calls them ""Jess and Jason"": they are the perfect couple, representing everything she has lost until one day, Rachel witnesses something shocking. ""Jess and Jason"" are Scott and Megan Hipwell. Megan is missing and Rachel feels compelled to insert herself in the mystery, offering what she knows to the Police. It fuels an already flammable situation with her ex husband and his new wife.The Girl on the Train is a compelling exercise in character study. Told from multiple points of view, each narrator is unreliable: the alcoholic, the liar, and the cheat. They're flawed, lying, faking, and filled with despair in lives that are disappointing. Sometimes, actually, most times, they're unlikable, but fascinating. It pushed all my buttons and I don't think I've winced or cringed so badly for a fictional character. I found the depiction and analysis of gender, especially women's roles in modern society, insightful. The way in which women scrunch themselves into roles, appropriating society's fantasies, competing with one another, inflicting harm (intentionally or unintentionally), in Disturbia is uncomfortable and thought provoking.This is not a perfect book, but its gritty, dark, melancholy, and the central mystery kept me flicking pages until I got to the end. If you like psychological thrillers and books that haven't adopted the pleonastic editing approach i.e. removing all the texture of language, I highly recommend it. "
1869,Ingrid,I loved how the mystery unfolded itself. A page turner.
1870,Russell Atkinson,"If you liked Gone Girl you'll love this one, too. A young woman goes missing. Is she dead? You think you know who the bad guys and good guys are, but then you're not so sure. The story is told through multiple characters' viewpoints. The suspense is ratcheted to unbearable levels. You have to read the next chapter, then the next.The primary narrator of the tale is Rachel, a self-deluding alcoholic divorcee. Although she was fired and is now jobless, she continues to ride the train into London every day so her flatmate/landlady won't find out. Tom, her ex-husband, is now married to Anna, the beautiful blond estate agent who has given him the child Rachel couldn't.Rachel fantasizes over a lovely young couple she sees from the train every day, Scott and Bridget (although she has her own fantasy names for them). She wishes her life was perfect like theirs. They live very close to her old house, the same neighborhood as Tom and Anna. Bridget, in fact, used to babysit for Tom and Anna. But then Rachel sees something that shatters her illusions about the young couple. A tall dark stranger kisses Bridget, who then goes missing. Tension builds and builds.As we hear from Tom and Anna and all the other characters, we find that all is not as it seems. The story is written with panache and acted superbly by the voice actors, especially the one playing Rachel. I devoured it. It's great to be able to give five stars to a number one best-seller. Sometimes they actually deserve it.I haven't read any other reviews, but I imagine a few will complain that the ending is too convenient and predictable. It is that, but by that time you will just be so anxious to find out for sure who dunnit (and what happens once it's revealed) that you won't care."
1871,Erin Rae L'Hommedieu,"At the risk of being a terrible human, there is something uniquely compelling about going down the rabbit hole with a crazy shit-show of a character. Kudos to the author for capturing and promoting these characters so beautifully. I'm torn between a 4 and a 5 here, but there is definitely a LOT to enjoy in this book. "
1872,Joey,A true page turner! I totally recommend this book. :-)
1873,Blessednotlucky,"I couldn’t put this book down. It’s written with narrators that change each chapter so you learn things from different perspectives and come to find why all their lenses are so very different.Like “Gone Girl”, this is a book I’d recommend you NOT read any spoilers about or it’ll ruin the reading experience. I was told early on that there was a ‘big twist’ and kept looking for it with each turn of the page. But, be patient Grasshopper – it takes a good damn while. Just relax and enjoy the story as it unfolds.Suffice it to say, “The Girl on the Train” is the book next in line after “Gone Girl” and “The Husband’s Secret” of obsessive reads and breakout bestsellers that soon “everyone” will be talking about. Be the first on your block to read “Girl on the Train” and remain the trendsetter that you are."
1874,Victoria Sadler,"To compare this book to Gone Girl does this book a disservice - this is miles better. Rachel, the main character in this psychological thriller, is one of the best unreliable narrators I've read in a long, long time. A woman still damaged from her failed marriage, dependent on alcohol and prone to blackouts. And all of this isn't added to make Rachel interesting, it's all critical to the plot and the devices used as Rachel, the girl on the train, sees something on her commute that should have had no witnesses. And this book is extra impressive given that it's a debut."
1875,Roberto García,"It's a very interesting book, shows a complex life philosophy and about the things that we are doing to change or improve ourselves"
1876,Hend Kholeif,"I couldn't put this down!! Best book I've read in a while. This is not a book to be missed. The story is narrated by 3 women, a liar, a cheater and an alcoholic. The narrations are flawed and sometimes full of gaps and lies. But that's what makes it so gripping. It's about finding out the truth bit by bit, through small truths and small revelations. Every character seems very deep and realistic, in a pretty horrible way because the raw narration brings out the worst in each character, but yeah... Halfway through reading, I found myself struggling with whether to feel sorry for the woman who ""disappeared"" or happy that she got what she deserved. But I guess that's how powerful the story was. It makes you understand how each of these characters think, selfish and immoral but also very understandable and relatable. More than anything, I think this story excels at characterization.So it's worth the read and worth the good ratings and all that hype. It's a compelling mystery, thrilling, dark and real. "
1877,Graciela  Garcia Moreno,"Un excelente thriller, que comienza con una historia simple que es contada a 3 voces de un modo ligero que poco a poco te envuelve en una trama difícil de descifrar. Mantenerte a la expectativa ha sido el principal objetivo de Hawkins y cada capítulo es una nueva inquietud, la narrativa como ya lo mencioné antes es simple y bastante dinámica pero lo que más me gustó es que logra hacerte dudar de todos los personajes y las ganas de resolver el misterio, son las que te mantienen al filo de la lectura. El final es el broche de oro por qué además de estar muy bien estructurado, también es bastante inesperado, la duda y los nervios te acompañan las últimas páginas y tú al igual que la protagonista sufres al descubrir la verdad, ya no quiero decir más, solo quiero agregar que lo recomiendo ampliamente por qué es de los libros que te atrapan haciéndote pasar un buen rato, por eso, si eres de los que disfrutas con los temas de desaparición y el juego de inocente/culpable, este libro es para ti. "
1878,Elizabeth j dunn,"Love to hate the charactersWow! These characters are so real, depressed, and depressing, deceitful and blatantly honest. Rachel, the alcoholic; Tom, her cheating ex-husband; Anna, his alarmist new wife; Megan, Tom & Anna's restless neighbor & nanny; and Scott, her jealous husband. Told from Rachel's, Megan's, and Anna's points of view, this suspense will keep you up all night. Rachel is dangerously determined to solve a crime while yo-yoing on and off the wagon. Megan's restlessness makes the reader feel like crawling out of her/his own skin. Is Rachel a danger to Anna's new family? Anna thinks so. No spoilers here. Many plot twists and full-out surprises, this is a must-read. Five stars for love-to-hate characters and ugly reality. A gut-wrenching book that is more realistic than we would like to admit. "
1879,Jonathan Mancina,At first I wondered what was so great about this book but then I was blindsided and it became a page turner for me. Anyone that likes a mystery has to read this. The entire time you're reading you want to know the background story behind every character and the true answer to the investigation.
1880,Gordana Vuckovic-Glusac,I won't say a word. Just read it!
1881,Breeze,"This is a perfect read when you are super down, life has been tough, relationships suck....This is how much worse it can get and be thankful!This is a book about 5 Losers!!Women who are cheaters, bad mothers, drunk, stubborn, self involved, crazy, mentally ill, liars, friendless, LOSERS!!!Men who are cheaters, bad fathers, stubborn, self involved, crazy, mentally ill, liars,friendless, LOSERS!!!!And the children suffer!but boy did I like it!!!This may have been fiction but it was so ridiculous it has to be true!"
1882,Rosalyn Davey,Wow. Just wow!
1883,Mikayla,"The twist was AMAZING! I highly recommend it, great read, couldn't put it down in some sections but great overall :)"
1884,MSJ (Sarah),Five stars alone just for the pure entertainment factor. For a thriller I thought this was excellent and surprisingly well written. Normally I am hesitant about these hyped new releases but I think this one is worth seeking out. Every character was so flawed and downright pathetic with even a tad bit of psychosis thrown in the mix. The author tricked me a few times and of course I never figured out who was the actual killer. Lots of twists and turns. Highly recommended.
1885,Ursy,Found it hard to put this book down. Kept me on my toes right to the end.
1886,Regina,4.5 stars
1887,Vicki Maggs,Read in three days. Loved it.
1888,Kris,This is the first book I've read in awhile that I couldn't put down! Loved it!
1889,Elena (Books & Reviews),One of the best books I've read this year. Review to come!
1890,Knjiski_Moljac,"Obično sam zaobilazila trilere, jer sam mislila da mi se neće svideti. Međutim, ova knjiga me je navela da ih stavim u jedne od mojih omiljenih žanrova.Dok sam čitala nisam mogla naslutiti šta će se sledeće desiti, niti ko je ubica, a to je uvek plus kad čitate. Povezivanje tri lika i pogled na celu stvar iz njihove perspektive je veoma dobro urađen. Niti je previše jednostavno, niti komplikovano. Savršen spoj za lako i zabavno čitanje.Ima te li neki prdlog? Šta sledeće da čitam? "
1891,Zuleeza,"After Blood of My Blood by Barry Lyga, I was in the mood for psychological thriller so I picked this up.This book satisfied my need and more. I love how it has a re-reading value, I love how it forced me to read slowly, to pay attention to where the chapter fits in the timeline, to take a break so I can think and speculate. I love how even though I predicted the culprit early in the book, there were so many distractions that threw me off and made me doubt my theory.Just a word of caution - if you think you would really, really have problems with morally-corrupted characters then maybe you would hate this book."
1892,Cecelia,"Great novel. Although I enjoyed it and am giving it five stars, I don't think it's an epic thriller. I've read books over the years that I enjoyed just as much as this one.It was intriguing and I was anxious to see ""who done it."""
1893,Angela Novak,"I loved this. Total binge read. I started it, and read every free second until I finished it. Not usually into psychological thrillers, but this was great!"
1894,Catherine Mahood,"I bought this book because I'd seen it in the window of Waterstones for weeks. I didn't quite know what to expect, because the blurb is quite vague. I was more than pleasantly surprised. This book was incredible, In the beginning I assumed it was just a Chick-Lit book by the writing style but as things kicked off it seemed to change. I will now and forever recommend this book to people!"
1895,Natashya KitchenPuppies,I absolutely loved this book!See full review here - http://livinginthekitchenwithpuppies....
1896,Monica (The World thru my Eyes BLOG) ,"5 brilliant stars!! This has been in all honesty one of the best books i've ever read. Gripping, terrifying an so intriguing. The characters were just stunningly created and the action never faltered. I thought it will be just an over-advertised book when i picked it up yesterday, but oh boy, was i in for a surprise. This book will hunt me for a while. Brilliant writing style. "
1897,Margaret Sullivan,"A master class in plotting! Layer by layer, as we work through the issues of each of three incredibly unreliable narrators, the story comes out slowly and with maximum suspense. I listened to this audiobook in a very meta way, as it was mostly while riding the train to work. I don't see anything terribly interesting, though, unfortunately! The Audible audiobook had three different readers and they were all excellent. It was very well put together and kept me on the edge of my seat!"
1898,Brooke,"RemarkableI am a young adult who is very much just into to reading the average young adult romance. This book, however, took me away from my norm and was surprisingly much more engaging than my usual. This book takes you from suspense to heartbreak to confusion in seconds and you almost feel that you are the character experiencing these events. I would recommend this to anyone who loves a mystery with a different flare but I would also recommend this to young adults like me who are looking for an incredible book that may not be what you're used to but that is worth straying from that norm to read. "
1899,Terri Chapin,"All right, I loved it! Snagged me early on, wouldn't let me go. I was fascinated how Rachel's character developed. The entire thing knocked me for a loop!"
1900,Chelsea Fabalena,"The story is so precise and everything little detail is so important to the plot that you just want to keep reading. The outcome is insane and I would have never guessed it. I recommend!! I'm not sure why so many people are hating on this book, especially if you complained about how depressing and how sloppy the characters where. Obviously it's going to depressing considering the fact that it is a thriller solely based on murder, lechery and unfaithfulness. I don't really see any room for happiness in this book and it would have been ridiculously cheesy if it was a picture perfect ending wouldn't it??"
1901,Susan Acosta,"I thought this book was being over hyped like many others I've read so I wasn't expecting it to be as great as it was. It starts off a little slow but picks up speed after about 50 pages. I had my theories along the way, but it kept me guessing up up until we find out about Megan's second baby. At that point I knew it was Tom. People claimed to have known right away, but I didn't put it together quite as quickly. So many people say they are all unlikable characters and I simply have to disagree. I liked Rachel, her realness, her vulnerability and her rawness. I felt bad for Rachel, yes she was weak and absolutely pathetic at times, but she didn't warrant any disdain on my part. She fell on hard times, had an abusive and manipulative husband who became her ex husband due to his infidelity which he blamed on her, she desperately wanted a child and was unable to have children, and she didn't seem to have a very good relationship with her parents. People go through things that change them, cause them to make some bad decisions and things happen. I cringed at things she did and said, but to me, she was a likable character. A hot mess - but likable.One part that left me scratching my head was the significance of the clothes she sees in the first page of the book and the clothes later towards the end of the book by the tracks.The tipsy red head from the train was a great ""red herring"". I focused on him a lot in the beginning and thought he had a huge part in whatever happened during the ""black dread"" of Saturday night.5/5 stars from me! "
1902,Queenlucchiuh,Holy molyThis book is so good. It swoops you right in from the beginning. The characters are well rounded and easy to become engrossed in their individual stories. The story itself is a tornado of what-the-heck! I would recommend to anyone who likes to feel like Dorothy from wizard of oz while she's spinning and is in between oz and Kansas. 
1903,Ashley,"It has been 4 months since I've read this and I realized I never wrote a review. What is there to say that someone hasn't already? The characters are all awful in the best way. I almost moved on to a different book about 15% in or so (took a break for a couple days I think) but I pushed through. I told myself that something had to be worth it in the end and I was right. I don't look ahead. I don't try to guess who the perpetrators are in any story. Or maybe I just suck at doing that anyways. However, it definitely helps keep the mystery there if I'm not trying to figure it out before the end.I am almost too good at putting myself in someone else's shoes. I could see where everyone was coming from and why shitty decisions were sometimes made. Alcoholic Rachel was so distressing in my head. The vulnerability of all relationships and marriages was just completely head on and frightening. I was an emotional wreck for a while there.5 damn stars from me. I loved it. I couldn't stop reading it. I missed a couple events because I couldn't put my kindle down. I read it in all my down time. I'm hesitant to read more like it because I felt so many different emotions from this story.(I think this is my longest review)"
1904,Michon Ball,"Wow!!! What an exciting, suspenseful thriller..... The lives of 3 women tragically and inexplicably linked but not fully revealed til the end. I raced through this book in 4 days."
1905,Anahi,"WOWZA!!!! This book caught my attention because 1, its currently on the top charts, 2 the reviews suggested that it was along the lines of the twisted genre like Gone Girl which I absolutely love. I ended up buying this book for my kindle and was able to fly through it. I loved the storyline which kept me interested the entire way. I felt like I was being manipulated by these characters. When everything begins to wrap up towards the end, I cannot believe how brilliant this author is. I would love to see this story as a movie. I highly recommend it!"
1906,Cat,"This book was difficult to read because the lead character was such a train wreck (pardon the pun). I think we all see a little of ourselves in her (or was it just me?). It had a little of a Gone Girl feel to it, but it definitely had its own story. I like Ms. Hawkins character development, and the story from the perspective of each of its characters is something I've admired in other writers (Barbara Kingsolver comes to mind, for one). This was a mystery that had me riveted, and I didn't start to suspect who the culprit was until very close to the end. All in all, a definite page-turner. "
1907,Donna Gough,"Rachel is enmired in depression after her inability to conceive a child. She turned to drink, and her alcoholism has now cost her her marriage, her job, her friends. She takes the train into London every morning and returns every evening in an attempt to hide her joblessness from the university friend who took her in two years earlier.An improbable protagonist, from the sound of it. And yet I found Rachel compelling and palpably real, a character who drew me in and kept me reading to the end. Rachel is obsessed by the disappearance of Megan, who lives on the same street where Rachel once lived with her ex-husband. Convinced she’s seen something that could help solve the mystery, she contacts Megan’s husband and inserts herself into the investigation. It does not go well. Rachel lies repeatedly to her ex-husband, his new wife (who suspects Rachel of wanting to harm her child), and Megan’s husband, not to mention the police investigating the case. She exaggerates her link to Megan, tries to hide her secrets, goes on the wagon and falls off again, and yet keeps pursuing the case because she fears that she is somehow connected to Megan’s disappearance but recalls little after being in a drunken stupor that night.This is not a fast-paced thriller or edge-of-your-seat suspense novel, but it is rich and (to me) captivating. The story unfolds from the first-person points of view of three characters: Rachel (primarily), but also Megan and Anna, the woman now married to Rachel’s ex-husband. A twist at the end may remind you of Hitchcock or James Cain. Well done.Five stars for depth of character development, intriguing storyline, and skillful writing."
1908,B.B. Gallagher,"I feel that what happens when a novel gets popular is that other books like it kind of ride its fame. This was the case with Girl On A Train. The novel in question is Gone Girl. These two books are very similar and I think it's pretty obvious the publisher just wanted to replicate its success. Here's the catch: Girl On A Train is much better than Gone Girl.First how are they similar? The narration is told through different characters perspective. A girl goes missing and the question is who done it.How are they different? Girl On A Train has like able characters a who you actually root for. There is redemption not just depression. Also the main narrator isn't a bitch, she's psycho-stalker alcoholic. Lastly, there is literary quality to this book it's not just a pop novel. There are metaphorical motifs, coming of age and well written mystery all over the place. What does the train represent for instance? What is the source of Rachel's alcoholism? What did she forget the night Megan went missing? This book was a real page turner. I know they got a movie in the works for it with Emily blunt. But I suggest you read it before the movie. It really is an Alfred Hitchcock type tale."
1909,April Griffin,I loved this book. It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I recommend this to everyone! 
1910,Eva Wildeman,"Tot het einde spannend, en hoe alles als puzzelstukjes in elkaar viel.. Het hield je in de ban"
1911,Robin,"This book has been compared to the movie Rear Window, and it's a good comparison. It has the same feeling of impending danger, of dread. It has twists and turns that keep the reader guessing. The girl, Rachel, rides the train to and and from London each workday. As she rides, she looks out the window at the houses she passes and imagines the lives the people lead. One couple particularly stands out to her: she gives them names and creates an imaginary life for them, idealizing them as the perfect couple. When she learns that the wife, Megan, has disappeared, she tries to find out what happened, but her alcoholism hinders her. In her quest for the truth, she becomes involved in the lives of narcissistic people, any of whom may have something to do with Megan's disappearance. If you like Hitchcock, this is the book for you."
1912,Katy,"I went in to this book expecting not to like it, so I was very surprised when I LOVED this book. It's touted as ""the new Gone Girl"" as all new female-driven thrillers are these days. However, this book is not Gone Girl - it's so much better. The writing is infinitesimally better . The story is more intense. The main characters are this fantastic mix of likable and sympathetic while also being repugnant and cringe-worthingly pathetic. This book is totally worth all the hype. "
1913,Susan P,"Every day on her way into London on the train, Rachel watches the beautiful couple in the house. It's just down the road from where she used to live - and where her now ex-husband lives with his new wife and daughter. If Tom hadn't left her, these people would have been Rachel's neighbors, possibly even her friends. As Rachel watches them from the train window, most days she's also got a couple of canned gin and tonics, or some of those little bottles of wine to keep her company. Part of the reason her marriage failed was Rachel's excessive drinking. And she hasn't been able to stop since. Then one day she seems something that changes everything - the woman is in her backyard as usual - but she's kissing another man. And the next day she's gone missing. Rachel could be the only one who knows about her secret lover. Should she go to the police? And even if she does, will they believe such an unreliable witness? Great thriller that reviewers are comparing to GONE GIRL."
1914,Sam,"This was a fantastic book, a pleasure to read. Even though I predicted the twist, the characters were so realistic, the pacing so well done, and the story so intriguing that I almost couldn't put it down. The book starts off relatively innocuously: a woman, people watching, creates a story for two strangers lives that is basically her hope for herself. But the author takes that and makes an amazing story out of it with murder, conspiracy, intrigue, and another case of an unreliable narrator trying to figure out exactly what she saw."
1915,Lexie__a,"4,5/5 J'ai vraiment beaucoup aimé cette lecture.Au début j'ai été un peu dérangée par la redondance de l'addiction du perso principale, mais finalement on s'y habitue et c'est ce qui fait son caractère après tout.J'ai aimé la tension constante qui augmente de plus en plus vers la fin et le dénouement.Très bonne lecture, qu'on pourrait comparer à Gone Girl (j'ai quand même préféré Gone Girl). Je recommande vivement ce thriller. "
1916,Kylie,"Seriously, read this book! I started feeling panicky as it was nearing the end as I didn't want it to finish. Thrilling on every page!"
1917,Susan Albert,"For readers who like to go deep into characters' inner workings. Hawkins creates compelling suspense, plants small clues that add up to big stories, and creates totally believable characters who hide their flaws from themselves while they reveal them to readers. In this book, character IS plot, enhanced by the use of 3 first-person narrators. Very well written, a page-turner of the best kind."
1918,Kelly Sierra,"Mind blown!1. Megan... that sucks girl. Probably shouldn't have dealt with your issue with human contact... probably should have continued therapy properly. But it all sucks.2. Anna- Really you witch? You're the biggest witch I've ever read about.3. Rachel - You poor poor ""Nell"". You're the biggest ""Nell"" narrator I've had in a long time. It was great to be in your company but boy it was hard to figure it out with such an unreliable narrator.This was by far better than what 
The Husband's Secret
 tried to do about secrets in a marriage and family, and this was also so much more rewarding than 
Gone Girl
 (and I love that book)."
1919,Gary,"I had this book recommended by a couple of my Goodread friends and was looking forward to reading it and how glad I am for the excellent recommendation. This debut novel gripped me from the start and I found it very difficult to put down. I can understand the comparisons to 'Gone Girl' but this book deserves it's own praise, excellently written with strong characters and a superbly paced story. There are twists and turns and the building of tension and anticipation is first rate. I can really imagine this been made into a film. I look forward to more from this author."
1920,Dion Santiago,"I loved Girl On A Train! I flew through this book in no time! I felt like I was peeking into the diary of an obsessive, neurotic, alcoholic and I could not look away! One for Sorrow, Two for joy, Three For A Girl...."
1921,Kate,"Reading response 6This book was very thrilling and an exciting page turner. There are three main characters that each take turns telling the story. The most interesting part is that they all are flawed in different ways and the reader is left questioning if any can be trusted. The content of this book explores the desire to want what you don't or can't have and the fascination with other peoples lives seeming perfect on the outside. When the characters delve deeper into each others lives they soon realize that everyone has a little secret that is not noticeable at first glance. I would definitely recommend this book to an older audience. This book would be a good recommendation to a high school student who is bored easily and often time has difficulty finishing a book. The various unreliable narrators coupled with an enthralling mystery is fast paced and keeps the reader interested. The mystery gives the reader a purpose to complete the book and figure out who done it!?! My favorite part of the book was the deep character development of each of the flawed narrators. It's easy to forget that not everyone is as perfect as they seem at first glance. The deeper you go, the darker it gets. "
1922,Kim Bailiff,"(First of all, make sure you've got the right ""Girl on the Train"" book. I don't even know if I read the one I was supposed to read! Did I intend to read ""Girl on a Train"" by AJ Waines?! Oh well. this one gets more stars.)I didn't like Gone Girl, but I saw a lot of similarities (most notable: WACKO characters) and I really enjoyed this book! It's a fast moving crime/murder-mystery fiction with lots of suspense and twists and a main character that you don't know if you like or hate. She sure is a HOT MESS!Anyway, I couldn't put this book down. A fast, fun read. Two thoughts: 1. All three female main characters in this book (there are 3) are seriously screwed up. So are all the men! Makes it hard to relate to ANYONE in the book. What the heck? ... On the other hand, who cares?2. Be careful that you note who is narrating each chapter before you dive in. On my kindle, the titles ""Megan"", ""Rachel"" and ""Anna"" were very pale and it took me a couple chapters before I realized that it kept switching perspective. (I was like, ""Wait a minute. I thought she was divorced from Tom..."") and I had to go back. Enjoy the ride!"
1923,Elvi Thesame,"This is quite simply one of the most interesting and brilliant books I have ever read ! I was completely engrossed and I really couldn't put it down until the end . A good story that leads us down a path of expectations , slowly building tension until an unexpected plot twist catches us off guard . All the elements are here : suspense , the intrigue of sex, violence, betrayal, secrets , manipulation , murder ... There were some times when I became very tired and annoyed by Rachel's alcohol addiction , but maybe that was what made the whole things look more interesting . I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good suspense thriller ! <3 :)"
1924,Jo Anne B,"Super creative plot! I loved the main character and how this book kept you thinking of everyone as a suspect. I didn't want to stop reading it. It is comparable to ""Gone Girl"" but so much better. I really give the author credit for having written this after ""Gone Girl"" and to pull it off like she did. I liked this book so much better mostly because I actually liked the main character. Plus this book had more characters and I enjoyed getting to know more about them throughout the book. Yeah I thought everyone was the killer at one time but that made it so fun! Then when I realized it wasn't who I thought it was then I thought well who could it be then? Such a great plot twist that kept me thinking to the end. I would love to read books like this everyday!"
1925,Natalie,"Holy (insert swear word here!) What a ride! That was one of the most awfully awesome books I have ever read! I didn't like one single character but I could not stop until I found out the twist! I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone that gets offended with language (which I do but like a train wreck I couldn't put it down!) I can't give it anything less than 5 stars it wouldn't be honest of my experience while in this twisted, hot mess of a novel! Can't wait for the author to write another one! Well done Paula Hawkins, well done!"
1926,Wendy,"Rachel is an overweight, divorced alcoholic with no real life of her own. Because of this, she's begun doing some people-watching while on the train on her way to and from work. Her people-watching is a bit different, though - she's watching two specific people, and she's built an entire life for them in her own head. They have a sweet, wonderful life, according to her fantasy, but soon she learns that the reality might be far different. As she tries to sort out the truth from lies for both her fantasy couple and her own past, we have to try to figure out if we can trust Rachel or not. This book started off a bit slow for me. I didn't feel bored, exactly, but it felt like the book wasn't what I expected. It didn't take long for things to change, though, and that was when I realized the beginning was intentional. It jars to reader, to go from what seems like a nice little life into something far different. Rachel, as a narrator, is very unreliable. It doesn't take long to realize that not only can we not trust what she says, but that even she doesn't trust what she says. Megan and Anna are not really any more reliable, though. Everyone has their own secrets, and none of them is willing to share all those secrets with us, the reader. I also found that I didn't really like any of the characters. There was no one in this book that I really liked. Normally, I would say this was a bad thing in a book. If I don't like at least one character, I feel like the book is a loss. But in this book, not liking anyone actually worked in its favor. I didn't like anyone, so I was willing to believe that anyone was capable of anything. I also didn't feel much sympathy for anyone. There were a few small moments here and there where Rachel, Megan or Anna elicited a tiny amount of sympathy, but it was usually very fleeting. I was kept guessing pretty much right up to the very end. As things began to unravel, I began to put the pieces together, but right up until the book actually confirmed my guesses, I wasn't sure if I was right or not. I really enjoyed that aspect. Sometimes I figure out who did it or why they did it very early in books, and I feel a bit let down. This book made sure that I was on my toes, trying to figure it all out, until the end, and that was a satisfying conclusion for me. "
1927,Michelle Hubbard,I LOVED this book! Can't wait for the movie! I hope they do it up right!
1928,Heather Scardina,"Could not put this down, there are so many twists and turns , love how it was written"
1929,Lisa Whitehouse,I brought this on kindle on a whim. Not my usual choice of book but wow! From page one I couldn't put it down! Very well written and very believable characters. Full of twists and turn and a surprising ending. I never wanted it to finish. Really hoping this author brings out another book soon! This story gave me a lot of sleepless nights and was really addictive. Would recommend to anyone!! Best book I've read in a long time. 
1930,Shawna,So good-I couldn't put it down. Now I'm tired. And I have a baby. Stupid book. GREAT book!!!
1931,Allison Kenney,I read this in one day! I couldn't put it down. 
1932,Steve Altier," I wasn't sure I would like this book. But others told me I had to read it, and I'm really glad I did. I couldn't put it down. I just had to know what was going to happen next.  Very gripping, suspenseful, and intense, not to mention the great group of crazy characters she created. This was a well described, well writing story that never slowed down, and the list goes on. A must read of you enjoy a good thriller. "
1933,Kristina Wright,"As addictive and fast-paced as Gone Girl, but with a (somewhat) more sympathetic protagonist. Hypnotic prose and a satisfying ending. Definitely an author to watch. I loved it. "
1934,Louanne,This one keeps your interest and keeps you guessing till the very end. Well done!
1935,Tammy Siegel,"This audiobook was captivating! Three women read the parts of Rachel, Megan & Anna giving it added personality. It is more of a mystery than a psychological thriller. I gasped at least a dozen times, frightening all in the vicinity! "
1936,Meem,"I am a sucker for a good mystery/thriller book where a person goes missing out of the blue! These are the kind of books that make me go, ""that was a good book!""The Girl on the Train was exactly like that. I couldn't figure out who was to blame and that made me love the book even more. "
1937,Audra,I'll never look at people on a train the same!
1938,Dianne,"Rachel is an unemployed, divorced alcoholic living with an old school mate who doesn't know that Rachel is unemployed. Too embarrassed to tell her flat mate that she lost her job for cussing out a client during a drunken lunch, she gets up every morning, and takes the train to London, then back every evening. The train's route takes her by the home she used to live in with her ex-husband, where he now resides with his former lover (now his wife) and daughter in that same house (amidst all of Rachel's old belongings). A few doors down from her old home lives a young hetero couple, and Rachel makes up stories about what she views as this couple's wonderful life. Then, one day, it all goes wrong.Told from the point of view of three women, the story is very good, and I enjoyed it very much. The last forty pages had me hooked, it just took me awhile to get there. I found myself putting it down because I began to tire of the foolish situations Rachel's drunkenness would get her into, although, if I was going to be fair, these incidences help to build up, and explain, what occurs at the end. At least one critic described this book as, ""...this year's ""Gone Girl."" I disagree. The book is well-written, but many of the characters are shallowly drawn, and let's face it - the twists in ""Gone Girl"" were jaw-dropping. This, not so much. Good read, but not five stars."
1939,Ye Lin Aung,"TL;DR : Very thrilling, dark, exciting and frustrating.This probably is the most frustrating book I've read so far and yet I couldn't stop reading it until the end. I somehow managed to reached the last few page and only then, could make a long sigh. Right from the start, the characters are sick, depressing and failing at their lives.I don't like it and I told myself to stop reading it several times along the way yet I did read it a day ironically.The storyline is really good, fast paced, moving back and forth between dates and related characters.Lastly, if you enjoyed ""Gone Girl"", I guess you might enjoy this one as well."
1940,Deanna Martin,"I've read more than my share of mysteries, thrillers, and suspense novel. Incredibly good, bad and really, really stupid. My favorite television genre are mysteries, particularly British ones with Detective Inspectors and proper cups of tea every time you turn around. But this, this jewel, is probably the best one I've read in a long time. Being so accustomed to the genre, I'm not usually flummoxed about where the story is going and ""who did it"", so to speak. However, it wasn't until the phone was found with only 50 pages left that the pieces began to fall into place. Even then, I still couldn't get my head around it. I had to keep going back and re-reading passages. It wasn't until literally the last page when I captured the full picture of both. As you can see, I read this in the space of 24 hours. I don't like clichés, but I was riveted. Well played, Ms. Hawkins, well played. "
1941,Stephanie Faris,"Let me just say, this book isn't what you expect. It's been compared to Hitchcock and in premise, I'd agree. Like Gone Girl, however, this book delves deep into unlikeable characters and makes you somehow like them despite their many (many) flaws. People said this one started off ""slow,"" but I don't think so. If you're expecting a thrill-a-minute mystery, though, you might be disappointed. If you're just ready to settle in and enjoy the ride, I highly recommend this one. Catch it before they cast the movie. It's always more fun when you aren't picturing Hollywood faces on the characters, I've found!"
1942,Carol Pentecost,"I really enjoyed this book. It kept me guessing all the way through. Although none of the characters were very likeable they were real and I lurched from being angry, sympathetic, impatient, understanding and confused by them. I was left glad that Rachel seemed to be sorting herself out. I did feel it needed at least one good man in it however, other than the policeman. I found Rachel's journey to self awareness very interesting. I too like to look into gardens and houses from the train and it made me wonder what I would do if I though I had seem something unusual. Recommend this to those who like a multi thread thriller. "
1943,Anita,"This book held me captive for close to 3 days. I wanted to drink it all in, to solve the mystery but I also didn't want it to end. Was anyone reliable? Such wonderful writing, so many dark sides. Loved it!! "
1944,Gina de Jong,"Finally a book that lived up to the hype it's getting!!! Totally has the Gone Girl vibe. I loved the way this was written, the mystery and the tension that goes back and forth really had me tuned in and ears perked!! Give this a try even if you didn't like Gone girl, it's not as psycho and dark...just slightly crazy!!"
1945,Sara Pianelli,"Che posso dire su questo libro... Non mi è piaciuto e non nel senso che è scritto male o cose di questo genere, ma è una storia veramente realistica dove le sofferenze delle persone sono fatti reali che possono succedere ad ognuno di noi ed è questo che non piace, che mi fa stare male dopo aver interrotto la lettura o dopo averlo finito. Sono dell'opinione che un libro debba farti sognare, uscire fuori dalla realtà e per un momento non presentarti i problemi reali della vita. Mi ero fatta un'idea sbagliata di questo libro e mi sono ritrovata con un'agitazione mai provata prima. Il mio voto obiettivo è 5 perché è scritto molto bene, entri precipitosamente nella storia e non riesci a staccarti dalla lettura perché vuoi sapere di più, ma da un punto di vista emotivo, soggettivo e psicologico non mi è piaciuto. Non vorrei più leggere qualcosa di simile. "
1946,Stefanie,Couldn't put it down. I haven't read a book in two days in ages! Page turner.
1947,Taomie Rosario,sooo good!!!!! 
1948,Yash Sinojia,"“A tiding of magpies: One for sorrow, two for joy, three for a girl, four for a boy, five for silver, six for gold, seven for a secret never to be told”Such a mind blowing...Each scene gave me chills in the pit of my stomach..It was at some extent a psychological thriller too..The story was quite awesome.There was so much suspence in every scene & the set up was all great.I was so hooked up till the end.I think it could have a still better ending...but although I can't rate it less than 5 it was a hell lot interesting.The Flow with all the characters was fascinating.."
1949,Jo Reason,"Rachel is the main character in the novel, she is hiding a few secrets which are revealed as you read on, she is annoying, but there were times I felt sorry for her, a bit of a like and dislike character. As she travels daily on the train to work, she creates her own little world, loads of people can relate to this, the same journey, the same faces, etc.and when she sees something from the window one day and feels she need to go to the police, and report it, but she doesn´t leave it at that, she gets involved, she can't leave things be. This leads Rachel into some difficulties. The story starts slow, with the tension building as you read on. Alongside Rachel there are there are two narrators in the book, Anne and Megan. I didn't particularly enjoy these other character either, but don't let that put you off, this is part of the novel, at least I thought so. You need to pay attention to the chapter headings, they have dates and this is important overall. This is a very clever book, well written, flows nicely, with twists and turns I didn't expect. One of the best debut novels I have read this year, a definite read for those who love psychological thrillers and cannot put down books. for more information click to view my blog. http://readinginecuador.wordpress.com..."
1950,J.W.,"Loved it! Well written, well plotted and with a main character that continues to haunt you after the final page. I highly recommend this book!"
1951,Julie K.,"J'ai vraiment beaucoup apprécié cette lecture ... un thriller comme je les aime même si à vrai dire, ma note serait plutôt de 4.5/5 que 5/5 (faudrait vraiment pouvoir attribuer des 1/2 étoiles sur Goodreads!). J'ai vraiment aimé le côté ""anti-héros"" des personnages. On est très loin des personnages de fiction parfaits ou irréprochables et moi, ça m'a vachement plu! "
1952,Breanna Meyer,"This was a quick day and a half read for me. I only wish it'd been longer! Such an interesting idea for a novel, I loved it! I love people watching and often find myself wondering things like Rachel did. Grew to love Rachel very quickly and really enjoyed reading from her point of view. I enjoyed too though, the glimpse into Anna and Megan's heads. Over all, a wonderful and thrilling read! So suspenseful and so hard to put down the further you get!"
1953,Jo Pizarro,well i finish it in 2 days and i shake all the finale it was amazin epic an totally unspected!!people pleas read this is a master piece !!
1954,Rachelann *Obsessed w/ Rabbits & Zombies*,"If you're sensitive to foul language, I suggest you stop reading RIGHT NOW.Because seriously, what in the actual fuck did I just read.My mind is blown. Like... I don't understand. Maybe it's because the time is 4 AM and I've been reading it since midnight? I feel like I can't think straight.I'm at a dilemma. I don't know whether or not to give this book one star for being so fucked up, or if it deserves five stars because it was written SO DAMN FRIGGEN AMAZINGLY GOOD?!?! For now, because it's 4 AM, I'm settling for five stars because in NO WAY SHAPE OR FORM DID I SEE THAT ENDING COMING!!! Annnddd I'm not finishing this review right now. I'm tired, and this novel fried my brain. Bye."
1955,Amy Rhodes,A pretty terrific psychological thriller. Convincing characters; tight editing; believable conclusion. I gobbled it. 
1956,Ashleigh,Depressing characters but I couldn't put it down. Full of suspense and intrigue. Makes me realize how nice it is to have a boring life. 
1957,Stella  ☢FAYZ☢ Chen,"This book really lived up to the hype. I loved reading the multiple point-of-views of the three women. Each perspective was unique, distinct and engaging. I loved reading Rachel's perspective the most, mostly because it sounded so genuine and in pain. Hawkins really captured the loneliness of Rachel, and it made me sympathize with her. Her perspective was also the least reliable. Here, is where I saw inklings of Gone Girl, which is a fair comparison. As a reader, I connected with Megan the most, probably because she was the youngest of the three women. Her worries, and struggles were more relevant to someone who is in their early and mid twenties. I enjoyed reading her troubled perspective, but I did not feel her pain and sorrow as much as I felt Rachel's.Anna was the one I felt the least connected to. Her perspective was the shortest and I am glad. She is awful, and I had a hard time seeing things in her perspective. Many times, I tried to put myself in her shoes, but failed. I could not understand the choices she made. Despite the fact I disliked her as a person, her character added a needed variety to the book. I am glad the readers are able to read her voice and experience her pain.I am pumped for the movie to come out this year, with Emily Blunt as Rachel! :O I'm still mesmerized by her in Edge of Tomorrow. *fangirling*"
1958,Sarah Brade,Great book had me gripped from the start and the ending didn't disappoint. 
1959,Isa Al Khalifa,"I know it took me more than a week to finish this. That's because I went to London for the holidays and didn't read a lot. Anyways, WOW! 5 starts!! AMAZING book!! AMAZING ending!! was NOT seeing that coming!! Ahh so excited for the movie!!"
1960,Tina Tennison,I read this book in two days. I thought it was a great mystery! 
1961,Kimberly Beaullieu,I love books that keep you guessing and wanting to read! This book did both! Enjoyed it and wanting to keep ready every time I picked it up! 
1962,unknown,"Bohaterka ""Dziewczyny z pociągu"" nie jest osobą która wzbudza sympatię, wręcz przeciwnie już od samego początku drażni, męczy, a potem wzbudza litość. Tym bardziej autorka wykonała kawał dobrej roboty, bo mimo tych odczuć miałem ochotę dalej śledzić jej historię i w miarę jak układanka nabierała kształtów tym samym zmieniały się moje uczucia do Rachel i z napięciem czekałem na dalszy rozwój wydarzeń. ""Dziewczyna z pociągu"" miała rożne opinie, jedni się nią zachwycali, a innym nie przypadła kompletnie do gustu. Tak skrajne oceny najczęściej charakteryzują jednak książki dobre, no a o gustach - no cóż...ponoć się nie dyskutuje. Ja należę do tych którzy odbierają książkę książkę popełnioną przez Paulę Hawkins bardzo pozytywnie. Odpowiadała mi wolno snująca się akcja, co budowało powoli napięcie. Bardzo dobrze skonstruowane są też postacie głównych bohaterów pod kątem psychologicznym, o czym za dużo pisać nie będę bo nie chcę zbytnio zdradzać treści. Przede wszystkim książka ta pokazuje jak mylące mogą być pozory i dlaczego warto sobie zadać trud poznania historii człowieka. Doskonały thriller! "
1963,Steph Bonilla,"Wow! This book is amazing. A must read, it will leave you with your mouth wide open. "
1964,Kate Ferry,Awesome read! Couldn't put it down!
1965,Donald Powell,"This was a good gritty mystery. It's realism, focus on human frailties and believable voice made it a fun read. I rarely read mystery/thrillers. This one intrigued me from reviews I read and am glad I selected it. The fifth star is for the great portrayal of alcoholism, selfishness and pride."
1966,Toni FGMAMTC,"Blew me away! Loved it! Full of mystery and suspense. I usually figure out where most plots are headed, but I did not with this one. It kept me on the edge. If you're looking for a feel good read, this isn't it. Much of it is pretty depressing actually, but so damn interesting! And full of flawed characters. No one is the ideal good in this novel. Excellent storytelling! I will be looking for more from this author."
1967,Books and Authors UK,"This book is great, you believe that everything is as you see it, for example a gent is wearing a suit so he must be off to work … or is he?! This story makes you think that everyone has a back story which you don’t know anything about. In this case there are many back stories in which you couldn’t guess just by looking at someone.Someone is having a drink on the train, what does that mean to you? In this book, Rachel has a drinking problem. She goes on the train every day to London and it stops at a signal which allows her to look over a row of houses and creates situations for a couple who live there. Jason and Jess, only they aren’t Jason and Jess.Secrets unfold, slowly, but once they do, there is no going back.There are lots of twists and turns, peoples backgrounds unfold. The truth comes out. There’s a chronicle liar, deception, adulterers, murder, to name a few.This book shows a few women’s point of views, I liked this, it was good to see how everyone matched up. How people view one another. I also liked that the writing changed for each person.This book lives up to the hype and most certainly up to those of its predecessors such as Gone Girl. However, this is more of a real life believable situation.I think this book will get a lot of press in 2015 and it will be for all the right reasons. It is addictive. You won’t be able to put it down. I have already been telling people about it. A must read of 2015, a book to sink your teeth into.It’s very realistic, it allows you to see that enemies can become friends. People have lives and addictions that you know nothing about.Nothing is ever as it seems….."
1968,Mainon,"Yes, I really do think it's as good as Gone Girl. It may not toy with you quite as much (my impression of the main character didn't change dramatically over the course of the book, which it definitely did with Amazing Amy), but the main character is complex and flawed and very real. I loved the way the mystery slowly unfolded and the conclusion was suitably dramatic and satisfying. "
1969,Margo,"I read this book for one of my March book club read and I have to say I was very surprised and intrigued with it. There are so many things to say about this book, I got so fed up and irradiated with the main character to then turn around and feel so bad for her. There are many twists and turn you think you have things figured out and then it all changes again. It was hard to put down so that made it for a quick read. I loved the writing style of this coming from the view of several people in the book and can't wait to read more form this author. Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning. Every day she rattles down the track, flashes past a stretch of cozy suburban homes, and stops at the signal that allows her to daily watch the same couple breakfasting on their deck. She’s even started to feel like she knows them. “Jess and Jason,” she calls them. Their life—as she sees it—is perfect. Not unlike the life she recently lost.And then she sees something shocking. It’s only a minute until the train moves on, but it’s enough. Now everything’s changed. Unable to keep it to herself, Rachel offers what she knows to the police, and becomes inextricably entwined in what happens next, as well as in the lives of everyone involved. Has she done more harm than good?"
1970,Emma Corcoran,Fantastically written riveting whodunit! Kept me guessing right up to the reveal and my heart firmly in my mouth throughout! 5+++
1971,Lana Hart,"4.5 stars.The Girl on the Train wasn't something I was expecting to read. One of my friends was reading it for his book club and handed it to me last night. I wouldn't say it's a ""short read,"" but I did finish it very quickly because I wanted to know if I was right.In the end, I was. But I don't think too many people will have guessed it from the start. My own unique experiences led me to see through the lies. I'll detail more below.SPOILERS!------------As a victim of an abuser and narcissist, I almost immediately knew Tom's game. I was happy that the author didn't go all Gillian Flynn and paint the women as the bad guys. The Girl on the Train was much more true to life in that way, and it was absolutely chilling.The first few ""chapters"" were fairly boring, but once I realized what was happening, it was a difficult book to put down. My only real criticism, besides the fact that some of the sections needed tightening up, is that it seems like every major female character in the book is in someway always speaking about either men or babies. And when they're speaking to each other, it's always cruel or catty. There doesn't seem to be any solidarity between women at all in this book, which is a shame, especially since at the end Anna had the opportunity to redeem herself.Anna, in my opinion, is just as bad as her murderous husband, Tom. While Anna doesn't actually, physically harm anyone (well...), she conspires to ruin lives, and when Rachel is going to be killed, she decides to sit and share a beer with him over her unconscious body. She's only upset at Tom for lumping her in with ""fat, ugly Rachel"" during one of his monologues (which I also thought were a little too villainous; more cartoonish than real), and the only thing that changes her mind (she is originally okay with Tom killing Rachel) is that she worries about their baby getting hurt. She is just as much of a dangerous psychopath as Tom is, and unfortunately, we don't get any justice for all that Anna has done (though Tom suffers spectacularly).I'm definitely keen on reading more from this author, especially in the mystery/thriller genre. I thought The Girl on the Train was very well composed and I was entertained (mostly) throughout. "
1972,Meredith,"Very good book! I figured it out before it was over, but not until I was getting close to the end. Loved how it was written by all three women too!"
1973,Ömer,5/5Benden tam notu alan ilk kitap. Gerçekten de hak etti! Yorumu için:http://kronikokur.blogspot.com.tr/201...
1974,Katherine Garcia,"Omg, pues aun estoy en shock con este libro. Lo primero es que desde que inicias te invade una sensacion de intriga con respecto a los personajes, desde el principio te vas creando ideas muchas erroneas y otras totalmente correctas eso me paso con uno de los personajes, su bajo perfil me alerto a bueno (SIN SPOILER) jajajja. El libro es fantastico, ame la narrativa ya no que solo lo narra un personaje si no varios,los personajes en si me encantaron aunque por momentos queria matar Rachel que es nuestro personaje principal, aun asi no pude evitar encariñarme con ella, si no han leido este libro que esperan? La Chica del tren es un viaje con bastantes baches pero del cual no vas a querer bajar... Recomendado..."
1975,Velo Bones,"Another book to add to the couple murder mystery genre - think Gone Girl, What Came Before, The Silent Wife. A rollicking read oddly akin to an episode of Midsomer Murders - everyone seemed guilty at one point. I didn't see the ending until the author revealed it. And I enjoyed reading from the point of view of a distrusted character whose life is messy."
1976,Megan Menendez,"This is the first book in a long while that has actually given me a ""book hangover."" It was my life for the past two days; it completely sucked me in. None of the characters are appealing, but their development through the book is part of what makes so interesting. And while I may not particularly like Rachel, there are certainly aspects of her character I am sympathetic to and with which I can (however remotely) relate to. She's lonely and therefore imagines an idyllic life for a couple she can see from the train every morning. When she finds out the real story, however, that's when it gets really interesting.Especially considering this is Paula Hawkins' first novel, it is incredibly well-written. Both plot and character development move at just the right pace to create suspense while keeping you interested and entertained."
1977,Arpitha,Super awesome book. Kept me hooked till the end.
1978,Andrea Mathis,I pretty much loved this book. I couldn't put it down. It had me guessing throughout the whole thing. I thought it was this guy at one point and then maybe this girl and then maybe this other guy. Page turner for sure. It does make you realize that things are always what they seem. 
1979,Prerna Goel,Brilliant. 
1980,Joanne Lidford,Crikey! Couldn't put it down. Lots of twists and turns. A life of being teetotal could be coming my way!
1981,Erin Al-Mehairi,"What an amazing thrill of a book! I love Hitchcock and totally could see why it was described as similar. At first the editor in me was going to hate the sentence structure and character tenses, but when I fixated more into the rhythm, I understood it and that all melted away. The pacing was spot on. I loved that it was written in British English. I loved her foreshadowing and her gothic and creepy elements. I liked her characterization. I enjoyed trying to figure Rachel out and felt sad for her, even when other people were not cutting her a break. I enjoyed how she played with the idea that people aren't always what they seem and to not judge a book by it's cover, all those norms, but done in a way that propelled me through the pages. The topics reached into my gut and made me feel on a depth that put knots into my stomach. Themes of motherhood, abortion, barrenness, male/female relationships, abuse, addiction, etc. all were explored in a captivating and mesmerizing way. This book will linger with me. "
1982,Celina Grace,"Thank God for CBeebies. By the time I was two thirds of the way through this excellent thriller, I had to put the children in front of the television so I could race through the final chapters. Utterly engrossing, an easy read and a really well paced psychological thriller. Paula Hawkins also has the enviable gift of making her central character sympathetic even though Rachel is a self-pitying, lying drunk. Highly recommended."
1983,Peter,"The Girl on the Train begins with Rachel on a commuting train to London. She enjoys looking into the trackside houses and imagining the residents’ lives. One particular trackside house in the village of Witney is occupied by a young couple whom she names “Jess” and “Jason;” four houses down the track is the house Rachel and husband Tom lived in until their divorce. Tom still lives there with his former mistress and new wife, Anna, and their daughter, Evie. To compound the interconnections, Jess has temporarily worked as Anna and Tom’s babysitter. Rachel is alone, lonely, and living with Cathy, a former classmate who pities her. Rachel is an alcoholic whose art gallery has failed, who was fired from her next job at an ad agency, and who has lost her bearings. She is angry, lost, and subject to blackouts--a truly pitiful person who stalks Tom and Anna, and is obsessed with their neighbors “Jess” and “Jason.” And something lurks in the background: on one commute Rachel notices some women's clothes lying at track side. The image haunts her—-was the wearer murdered or in an accident, or are the clothes simply trash? Rachel is not the only wounded bird. Megan (Rachel’s “Jesse”) and Scott (“Jason”) have their own problems. Scott is a jealous and perhaps violent man who occassionally erupts at Megan, and who tracks Megan’s emails. Megan’s sad history (of which Scott is largely unaware) suggests much to be jealous about. Meghan is unhappy: she suffers from panic attacks; she has an affair with her therapist; and she goes missing on a night when Rachel has been seen in her neighborhood stalking Tom and Anna while drunk. As Meghan’s disappearance becomes permanent, Rachel becomes a “person of interest.” She is released and warned by the police to stay away from Tom and Anna. But she is her own worst enemy--she simply can’t leave bad enough alone. She intrudes into the story like a bulldozer in a dining room, thrashing about as she seeks understanding, connectedness, and attention. She is guilty—-of overacting, if nothing else. Rachel really is crazy! But one wonders if she is crazy like a fox. As she tears into the lives of Tom, Anna, and Scott (“Jason”) after Meghan’s disappearance, we discover that they also have tragically damaged histories. Happiness is not a commodity in the village of Witney, though its surface is calm. A subtext of the novel is the fallibility of memory. Rachel’s blackouts are permanent, possibly because (as we learn) alcoholic blackouts aren’t a matter of not retrieving memories; rather, they are episodes in which memories simply aren’t formed! And even those memories that are recovered are highly unreliable. Memory is dipping into a box of photos and pulling out random images to fill in the blanks. Rachel is trying to recover her history from a diary filled with blank pages.Paula Hawkins is adept at building up tension, releasing it slowly, then doing it again. It makes this a very good read—one doesn’t know true from false, good from bad, salvageable from irreparably damaged, lover from devil. The fates of the protagonists twist in the breeze until the final revelation. If you like suspense with subtlety, and a cast of interesting characters, none of whom are virtuous, you’ll get a treat reading this book. Five stars!"
1984,April Henry,"This is the second high-profile thriller I've read this year, but this one really lives up to the hype. I like books where the author only reveals some things but does it so smoothly it doesn't feel manipulative. Also, she did a great job of creating a main character who walked the line of being unlikeable. "
1985,Will Bennetts,This book reminded me a lot of Gone Girl. I loved the fact that each narrator had their own secrets so you were always wondering about what was going through their heads at any given time . The book does jump back and forth every so slightly but this is a conscious decision due to the narrative . I highly recommend this book to fans of Gone Girl. 
1986,Brian Quick,Engrossing mystery...wraps up a little too tidy but a good four and a half star read. 
1987,Pat,"I Have to give it five stars because it was just the most overtly voyeuristic book I think I've ever read. I felt like I was spying on the characters and they were, none of them, particularly likeable but you just couldn't look away. I'm not much of a critic but I thought that was clever writing. Anyway, as you're reading it you feel like there's a train-wreck (pun intended) just waiting to happen. A sense of real menace builds throughout as the characters lurch towards an inevitable horror. Waiting for more from this author"
1988,Sydney,"Before I started reading this book, I saw so many negative reviews about the characters. I was hesitant to dive into the book for fear of disappointment. Now, after reading it, I see why people thought all of the characters were flawed, but now why that is such a bad thing. Each person in this story had such a deep profile and engaging history. I couldn't help but like each one of them; despite or maybe because of how flawed they each were. The only problem I had was about halfway through when Rachel was wrestling with her drinking and trying to sort out forgotten memories. I found reading her chapters frustrating and difficult to continue for very long. And then one day, it clicked. I was feeling Rachel's frustration. I was swimming with her through her drunk confusion and patchwork memories from the black outs. I was then unable to put the book down (even getting scolded at work for going past my lunch hour, ignoring my sandwich and disgesting as much of her story as I could). The Girl on the Train was so enjoyable, I'm going against my policy of loaning books out and sharing this with whomever I can."
1989,Angela Rhudy,"This is the first Paula Hawkins books that I've read, and I really enjoyed it! It kept me wanting to keep reading and not put it down. The plot twists are great, keeps you thinking and guessing. One of the best books I've read lately. I highly recommend it!"
1990,Jodi,"I've been waiting for a book like this for awhile now--I loved it! Rachel has a drinking problem that has effected her life in many ways. It destroyed her marriage, caused her to lose her job, etc. Yet, she still takes the train every day at the same time just so her roommate doesn't know that she is out of work. Rachel invents imaginary scenarios of what is happening in the houses along the train route- that is until she sees something that relates directly to a missing person. With all of that said, this is a murder mystery that reads like ""Gone Girl""- told alternatively from a variety of different characters. This engaging story unravels, twists and turns throughout the entire novel. It's definitely worth the read! "
1991,˗ˏˋ dani aquino ˎˊ˗,"Actual rating: 4.5
“There is something comforting at the sight of strangers safe at home.”
I was hesitant to pick this book up because I wasn't that much familiar with the psychological thriller genre, but curiosity got the best of me and I ended up trying it out. I haven't even read/watched Gone Girl, yet. Never mind that people have been saying that this book is really creepy, and that I'm a coward and generally avoid creepy things. What could go wrong, right?Everyone in this book was fucking messed-up. They were twisted. Most of all, 

they cannot be trusted

, even the three women narrating this story: Rachel, Megan, and Anna. Absolutely trust nobody. These people aren't what you think they are.
""My mother used to tell me that I had an overactive imagination; Tom said that, too. I can't help it, I catch sight of these discarded scraps, a dirty T-shirt or a lonesome shoe, and all I can think of is the other shoe and the feet that fitted into them.""
Meet Rachel. She takes the train to and fro everyday. She's the kind of girl who likes to observe her surroundings and imagine what the lives of people are like. She makes up stories in her head and invents different scenarios surrounding these people. One couple in particular caught her interest. She called them ""Jason and Jess,"" and they were Rachel's definition of a perfect couple with a perfect life. They remind her of what her life was like not so long ago, when she still had a promising future.But something bad happened that completely shook things up. Things weren't what they seemed to be. Rachel saw something, and she just had to get involved. Even if people don't believe her. Even if people will think she's crazy. Even if her life gets put in danger.What I liked about this book is its air of mystery. The secrets were endless. Information wasn't spoon-fed and the author was in no hurry to establish the characters' backgrounds. Just when you think you've got a character all figured out, something gets revealed and you will end up questioning just how much you know this character. The narrators were very unreliable, but they were written well. There's a depth to their personality. They might not have the best morals, but they felt very real. I didn't relate to these characters, but I sympathized with them. I can even go far as to say I cared for their fate.The Girl on the Train was gripping, full of angst, and very 'unputdownable.' I expected it would take me long to finish this book but I finished it in just one sitting. I will read Gone Girl next, just to see what the comparison is all about. -End of review-"
1992,Megan Strang,"SPOILERS AHEAD. Reading spoilers before you read the book will ruin it for you in this case. This was a great book. It was billed as the next Gone Girl, which I always hear with trepidation because Gone Girl wasn't all that, but I thought this ended up being far superior. First, I had no sure read on whodunnit and second, it didn't have a totally heinous ending. Having so many unreliable narrators made me question everything and ultimately helped obscure the true story until the satisfying reveal. I had all sorts of crazy theories, including the idea that the entire book was in Rachel's head and not real at all. As I said above, I was glad that I avoided reading too much about the book so that I could enjoy the experience of trying to figure out (and failing) what was going on. I think it's rare to have a true surprise ending these days and this one delivered. "
1993,Kevin Klukowski,"How do I even begin this review? All I can say is, that was unexpected...? Although I did have some doubts about that one character, who's name I will not mention so I don't spoil it. Their life story was quite odd to me. But, I guess in the end, ALL of their stories were a bit messed up. If you're looking for a psychological thriller, this one is definitely for you. "
1994,Cathie Anderson,Wow. Did not see that one coming at all! 
1995,Luanne Ollivier,"The Girl on the Train is Paula Hawkin's debut novel. And oh, what a debut!!Rachel rides the train to London every day, keeping up the pretense that she she still has a job and a place to be. In fact she doesn't - her alcoholism has cost much - her husband, her job and her home. Adding salt to her wounds is the fact that the train makes at the station by her old neighbourhood. Twice a day, Rachel passes by this row of houses by the station. She often sees a couple she has named Jess and Jason in their garden and has created a fairy tale life for them - one she imagines she might have had. Then one day she sees Jess kissing someone else. And then she sees on the news that the woman she calls Jess is missing. Rachel takes her information to the police - but can't leave it be and she slowly insinuates herself into the investigation.....The Girl on the Train is told from three different viewpoints - that of Rachel, the missing woman and Rachel's ex-husband's new wife.But it is Rachel driving the story - and she is a deliciously unreliable narrator. She drinks to blackout and often cannot remember where she has been or what she has done. But the flashes of clarity she does have frighten her...""Something happened, I know it did. I can't picture it, but I can feel it. I'm frightened, but I'm not sure what I'm afraid of, which just exacerbates the fear.""The missing woman also tells her story, leading up to the day she disappears. She too is an unreliable narrator, concealing her past and lying about her present.Hawkins keeps the reader guessing as the story twists and turns, changing with every revelation, memory and action. Who is telling the truth? What did really happen? I had my suspicions as the number of pages left to read dwindled and literally couldn't put the book down until I finished. (Pick a nice lazy day to start The Girl on the Train - you won't want to do anything else)Hawkins' depiction of alcoholism is troubling but highly effective as a plot device. I've also traveled by rail and was easily able to put myself in a seat looking out - wondering about someone else's life.The Girl on the Train is a great psychological thriller and is absolutely recommended. Dreamworks Studio has also optioned the movie rights"
1996,Jeanne Powers,Loved it! Did figure it out towards the middle but loved it anyway!

1998,Dana Frawley,Read this book it 2 days! Couldn't put it down
1999,Cheryl,I really enjoyed this! suspenseful and a great whodunit.
2000,John,"Rachel has always wished for an ideal life: a satisfying career and a loving husband and family. But, when Rachel discovers she is unable to have children, she sink into a depression and begins to drink. As her alcoholism worsens, she loses her husband, home and job. Fearing her flatmate and landlord discovering her unemployment, she takes the train into London each morning. One of the stops is her old neighborhood and affords her a backyard view of a lovely home often used by the residents, a couple whose life she fantasizes about even naming the residents, Jason and Jess. Longing for her old marriage, she begins harassing phone calls to her ex-husband upsetting his current wife. However, during one stop she discovers Jess kissing another man. After several drinks, she decides to take the train to her old neighborhood to investigate. When she awakens the next day, she discovers herself with a hangover, naked in bed, covered with dirt, bruises, lacerations and dried blood with no memory of what happened. A couple of days later she reads in the newspaper, that Jess now Megan, is missing, which leads the police to her door since she was identified by her ex-husband and new wife as being in the neighborhood in front of Megan's home the night of her disappearance. The night Rachel doesn't remember. This novel is told from the perspective of three women, each with their respective flaws, which make each an unreliable narrator. The plot of this psychological thriller is structured in a manner that to make the novel a true page turner. If Alfred Hitchcock was still alive, this would his next film. I highly recommend for your reading pleasure"
2001,Talia Guida,"Thrilling twists and turns all the way through to the end. Reminds me of a certain Carrie Underwood song, and it's not ""before he cheats..."" Definitely a must read, especially if you're into darker literature. "
2002,Frances Ryan,"Wow. I've read quite a few comments from people saying that they didn't understand all of the hoopla. Having just finished this incredible novel I am confounded as to how anyone could have felt that way. Yes, it's a whodunit page turner with quite a few twists and revelations. But at the heart of it, this is a stunningly accurate portrait of a alcoholic. Alcoholism is prevalent in my own family and I recognized so many of the characteristics of the disease in Rachel. For me, this was less a mystery novel and more of a horror novel. The author did an extremely good job of making the reader feel the terror of what it's like to wake up covered in blood and not remember how it got there. That scenario itself could have been such a cliche' but the writer managed to make it feel fresh. Loved this book. "
2003,Vijayalakshmi,This is probably the most exciting book I have read in a while. From the moment I picked it up there was no putting it down. I was glued to it. The characters are so well fleshed out that I can't help but hate them seethingly. It's beautiful when a book can inspire such strong passion (or hate) in you. The plot unravels slowly taking its own sweet time but never languidly. It's still gripping enough that it has you at the edge of your seat. The ending is unexpected and doesn't disappoint. loved every word.
2004,Santa,"Viena no grāmatām, no kuras izvairījos nezināmu iemeslu dēļ. Iespējams, domāju, ka tas noteikti būs populārās grāmatas “Gone girl”(Gillian Flynn) atražojums vai kopija. Zināmas līdzības ir. Taču viss beidzās ar to, ka pavadīju gandrīz katru brīvo minūti, to lasīdama.Viss sākas ar Reičelas skatu punktu. Sieviete mazliet pēc 30, sēž vilcienā un caur atmiņām izdzīvo gan savu neveiksmīgās, šķirtās laulības stāstu vēlreiz un vēlreiz, gan uzbur stāstus par no vilciena loga ieraudzītu pāri uz mājas terases. Jau no paša grāmatas sākuma Reičela ir neuzticama realitātes lieciniece, jo, pirmkārt, viņas problēma ar alkoholu ir milzīga, un, otrkārt, viņas fantāzija un iedomas skrien realitātei pa priekšu. No vilciena loga redzētais pārītis uz mājas terases viņu valdzina un pievelk, viņa katru rītu gaida mirkli, kad vilciens brauks garām viņu mājai, lai ieraudzītu savu sapņu pāri. Tas ir visai dabiski, jo Reičela ir zaudējusi vīru, māju, darbu, draugus, pašapziņu, jebkādu pamatu zem kājām, un šis pāris simbolizē viņas cerību, ka mīlestība tomēr pastāv par spīti viņas sabrukušajai dzīvei.Anna ir tā “otrā sieviete”, Reičela ģimenes ligzdas postītāja, kas dzīvo kopā ar Reičelas bijušo vīru viņas bijušajā mājā. Grāmatā tiek atklāts, ka Anna ir super seksīga sieviete, un Reičela vispār viņai nevar stāvēt ne tuvu klāt. Annai ar Reičelas vīru ir kopīgs bērns, un šis fakts Reičelu ir novedis līdz baltkvēlei.Megana ir sieviete uz terases, ko Reičela redz katru rītu no vilciena loga. Trausla, mākslinieciska sieviete ar savām neirozēm. Un kādu dienu viņa pazūd.Romāns veidots, sieviešu stāstiem minoties vienam ar otru, bez lineāra laika. Žēl, ka nebija vīriešu balss šajā romānā. Stāsts mani aizķēra, un es knapi noturējos, lai nepāršķirtu lapas un uzzinātu, kas ir vainīgais. Intriga bija, manuprāt, uzturēta ļoti veiksmīgi, lai arī grāmatas varoņu bija tik maz.Iespējams, Reičelas absolūtais “lūzerisms” un nespēja loģiski apdomāt visu notikumu cēloņus un sekas bija tik pievelkošs. Tas bija neticami, cik šī sieviete stūrgalvīgi darīja aplamības. Tagad, skatoties atpakaļ, man liekas neticami, ka šāda sieviete varētu pastāvēt realitātē, bet droši vien tas ir iespējams. Aizrāvusies ar alkoholu vai paģirās, viņa zaudē pēdējās saprāta paliekas, kad viņai gandrīz nav palicis naudas, viņa tāpat izvēlas nesaprātīgus tēriņus utt. Īsts trainwreck. Kronis visam bija tas, ka pēc uzbrukuma viņai, Reičela raksta e-pastu uzbrucējam, lai atvainotos par melošanu.Lai neatklātu vairāk par sižetu, jāsaka, ka visi pārējie personāži nebija nekādi enģeļi, ir grūti kādu no viņiem apbrīnot. Lai arī es ar viņiem nedraudzētos, mēs kopā labi pavadījām laiku.2016.gadā būs arī filma ar Emily Blunt Reičelas lomā.https://santasbiblioteka.wordpress.co..."
2005,Ana Trofin,I will never be able to look at the houses and apartments I see from the train the same way... what dark secrets hide between closed doors and curtained windows?This books is captivating and thrilling and it will make you think and re-think what you see around you...
2006,Ann Monin,Page turner! Enjoyed every page. 
2007,Stephanie Gunn,Read it in two days. Could not put it down. Suspenseful and intriguing. 
2008,Svenja,"Die depressive und alkoholabhängige Rachel führt ein tristes Leben, doch jeden Tag fährt sie mit dem Zug und beobachtet ein ganz bestimmtes Paar, sie sieht ihr perfektes Glück und wünscht sich genau das für sich selbst. Sie fühlt sich mit dem Paar verbunden und hat ihre ganz eigene Vorstellung von Jess und Jason die eigentlich Scott und Megan heißen.Doch an einem Tag wird ihre wunderschöne Vorstellung von den beiden zerstört, sie beobachtet ein schockierendes Ereignis und sie ist mit Wut erfüllt.Nur kurze Zeit später prangt Megans Gesicht alle Zeitungen, die junge Frau ist verschwunden und die Polizei tappt ahnunsglos im Dunkeln.Rachel fühlt sich dazu verpflichtet ihre Beobachtung mitzuteilen und dann wird sie in den Strudeln der Ereignisse gerissen...Gestaltung:Ich mag es, dass das Cover so dunkel ist und auch ansonsten eher schlicht gehalten hat, es lässt die Gefahr hervortreten und macht einfach Lust, ich finds optisch wirklich toll. Meinung:Auf das Buch war ich schon lange wahnsinnig gespannt, ich bin allgemein nicht so der Thriller Fan, aber es gibt bestimmte Bücher die mich dann doch ansprechen und unglaublich neugierig machen und Girl on the Train gehört zu diesen Büchern.Bereits der Anfang konnte mich von sich überzeugen, ich mochte von Anfang an die Erzählweise, wir lesen zu einem aus der Perspektive von Rachel und zum anderen aus der von Megan allerdings findet ihre Erzählung ein Jahr zuvor statt. Dadurch lernen wir Megan kennen und begreifen schnell, dass Rachels Traumvorstellung von ihr nicht der Wahrheit entspricht. Ich fand es sehr spannend ihren Weg bis zu ihrem verschwinden zu verfolgen und war gespannt was sich alles über sie offenbaren würde. Und wie oder ob es Zusammenhänge zwischen ihr und Rachel gibt.Denn Rachel ist nicht wirklich leicht zu durchschauen, sie leidet unter einigen Blackouts, die durch ihre Abhängigeit von Alkohol entstehen und auch sonst wirkt sie nicht wie die klarste und vertrauenvollste Person.Zumal ihr Verhalten auch manches Mal wirklich bedrohlich scheint, so hat sie nicht nur eine Faszination zu Megan und Scott aufgebaut sie tyrannisiert auch immer noch ihren Ex (die in der gleichen Straße wohnen) und seine neue Freundin und war ausgerechnet am Tag von Megans verschwinden wieder dort, hat allerdings einen Filmriss.Ich konnte die Charaktere insgesamt alle nicht leiden, sie waren alle von ihren Problemen erfüllt und insgesamt ziemlich ich-bezogen, dennoch fand ich das nicht schlimm und konnte sie gut ertragen. Und dennoch schwankte ich immer zwischen Mitleid und Abscheu zu ihnen und ihrem Handeln. Erst im letzten Drittel konnten Megan und Rachel bei mir an Sympathie gewinnen, was ich sehr schön fand.Dadurch, dass die Charaktere alle so kaputt waren hat das Buch eine ganz bedrückende und depressive Stimmung bekommen die wirklich auf mich abfärben konnte, es war also nicht immer einfach mich in Rachels Leben zu begeben aber dennoch ging eine große Faszination von ihr und dem Geschehen aus, der ich mich auch nicht entziehen konnte. Im späteren kommt dann auch noch die Sichtweise von Anna hinzu, sie ist die neue Frau von Tom und so werden auch diese Charaktere näher in die Geschichte mit einbezogen und lassen die Zweifel an Rachel wachsen und neue wüste Vermutungen entstehen durch ihre Schilderungen.Ich hab wirklich lange gebraucht um die Puzzleteile zusammen zu fügen, es kamen so viele Täter in Betracht und ich fand es auch schön zu rätseln, das Buch lädt dazu wirklich ein. Nach einer Weile konnte ich mich dann schon auf eien Theorie festlegen und die hat sich dann auch bestätigt. Schlimm fand ich es nicht, denn dann gab es ja immer noch den Showdown, die Konfrontation und ich muss wirklich sagen, dass die es in sich hatte.Ich war wirklich aufgeregt und hab ein kribbeln gespürt, vielleicht auch weil ich Thriller eher weniger lese, aber es hat bei mir wirklich Gänsehaut verursacht, das Ende hat mich wirklich packen können, ich war wirklich aufgeregt und klebte an den Seiten.. Das Ende hat mich wirklich vollkommen begeistert zurück gelassen und ich konnte dem Buch definitiv verzeihen, dass es zwischendrin zu einem kleinen Hänger gab, weil ich das Gefühl hatte auf der Stelle zu treten.Fazit:Es ist ein ungewöhnlicher Thriller, die Charaktere zielen nicht darauf ab sympathisch zu sein und man weiß nie ob man sie bemitleiden oder für ihr sein und tun verabscheuen soll, auch ist die Spannung Anfangs eher unterschwelig da, aber am Ende ist sie da und konnte mich richtig packen. Dennoch ist es eigentlich von Anfang an interessant, weil Rachels obsessives und bedrohliches Verhalten für so viel Zweifel und Spekulationen sorgt, man möchte einfach wissen was hinter der Geschichte steht, so dass ich dieses Buch definitiv nicht aus den Händen nehmen konnte ehe es zu Ende war."
2009,Júlia Dias,So intense and twisted! got me hooked from page one to the very end
2010,Jen Lawrence,"Oh how I enjoyed this book. It is a tautly written page turner. Like many books in this genre, it's hard to identify fully with any of the characters, yet it reads as psychologically true. Don't start this book if you have anything else to do: your life will be on hold for a few hours while you finish this! "
2011,J,"Although this book was full of melodramatic suspense and characters I did not like, I couldn't put it down after I passed the first 50 or so pages. At that point I realized that the characters were all such terrible people that anyone could have been a suspect. Also by the last 100 pages I was dying to get the full replay of what happened. The suspense in the storyline built up well. The ending was pretty flat, it made me say ""that's it?"" But it also made me wonder what the outcome is for any of the characters involved. Maybe one of the guys in this story should get a spinoff novel about them. Food for thought. Bottom line: I would recommend this book (twice) to anyone who likes suspense and to anyone who loves or loves to loathe certain characters"
2012,James Rye,"I bought this because it was popular on Amazon and I wasn't disappointed. It is a very skilful, rich, and compelling first novel.Some books take you all over the world. This takes you deep inside the personal world of three struggling individuals, and it is that detailed portrayal of character and the abundance of fluid but crafted detail from inside their heads that makes it so interesting and the plot so plausible. In their own ways all three characters are unpredictable. I found that this added an extra level of tension in the book. There was clearly threat in the foreground, but because you didn't quite know what the characters might do next, there was always a second level of possible disaster lurking in the background.On the surface, you wouldn't think anything much could happen - a woman regularly commutes on a train. You are lulled into a false sense of security to start with. However, once the plot begins to unravel you do feel the frustration of the main protagonist trying to divert disaster as she wrestles with those who dismiss her and manipulate her, as well as with her own self-inflicted demons.A good, entertaining read that was difficult to put down."
2013,Kathie Giorgio,"Well, first off, I have to say I read this book while on a train trip from Milwaukee to Portland, Oregon. It was endlessly amusing to be a girl on the train reading The Girl On The Train.That aside, this was a stunning book. You can't just classify it as a mystery - there's so much more to it than that. A study of alcoholism, post traumatic stress disorder, relationships, grief - it's all there. And when it comes to the mystery - and this isn't a spoiler - the author did a brilliant job of weaving everyone into the possibilities.About the only criticism I can give is that I had difficulty accepting the black-outs that Rachel had. I don't disbelieve in black-outs - but hers were so conveniently placed. They felt sometimes contrived. But that's not enough to make me knock it down a star, and it wasn't enough to keep me from reading like a freight train through this book. Pun intended.Excellent."
2014,Christine Travers,"At first it's a bit puzzling wondering where the author is leading you. The book is told from different perspectives, which adds to the intrigue. As each character narrates, their story becomes more defined, yet the reader still is left wondering what is real. It isn't until all the pieces come together that we fully understand what happened. A definite page turner the more I read. "
2015,Anne Michaud,Whoa.
2016,Kristy Taylor,"First of all, I listened to this book rather than read it; it made an excellent audio book. The story is a good one, moving along at a good pace. The main character's sadness and inability to get a grip on herself is something we can all understand, especially as the story unfolds and we understand more of what has happened to her. The author kept me guessing as to who the killer was right along with Rachel (main character); the reader only sees the truth one step ahead of Rachel. It is somewhat like Gone Girl in the twists and surprises that come to light, but the story hangs together better than Gone Girl. To me, it was a more believable story. The ending is also more satisfying. I recommend this book as a good read and as a good listen."
2017,Meredith Henning,"LOVE this book - so good. Listened to this one on Audible.com and the narrators totally make this book awesome! Some language and violence, but overall at least 5 stars!"
2018,Heidi,"This intriguing psychological thriller had me from page 1 and I loved the whole journey - the premise of Rachel constructing lives and personalities for people she observes from the train to make up for her own unhappy life was interesting and provided a great base for a book. As the story unfolded I was drawn into the lives of the (very dysfunctional) characters and could not put the book down. A refreshingly different story - as a train commuter from way back I could relate to the whole premise of getting a glimpse into people's lives from behind a glass window and seeing things out of context which are open for interpretation and flights of imagination - what a great way to base a murder mystery on it. Very highly recommended.PS: I hate it that every new thriller featuring a dysfunctional / troubled female main character is being compared to ""Gone Girl"" - personally I think this story was nothing like it."
2019,Sally Hepworth,This is the book I'd been waiting for. You know when you're in a reading slump and nothing grabs your attention? That was me. Then I read this. Now I miss it. Go now. Clear your schedule. Read this book. I'm jealous it's you and not me.
2020,Sevie_Reads,"Oh my heck! Wowzers -- this is a great book. I read all the comparisons to Gone Girl, and I can say -- yes, if you liked that book; or liked reading it, but hated the characters in the book -- you'll like this one too.Horrible people, doing horrible things -- it's kinda like watching Horders on TV -- you can look at them and think, ""I'm not so bad."" I listened to this one on audiobook and the multiple voice recording was great. My only trouble with this one -- and I'm sure it is just because I was listening, was that I couldn't quite keep the dates of the chapters straight. Nevertheless, it was a very enjoyable read/listen."
2021,Lindsay,"Loved loved loved this book!Really compelling, and you won't work out whodunit until the end.The story is told from three different viewpoints and it can be hard to know who's account is most reliable.The main narrator is a drunk, with holes in her memory and a life that is falling apart. She is the girl on the train, who gets glimpses into another couples life.The only thing I didn't like was the date difference between the three characters, sometimes I had to look back to check what date was being written about it.A summer must read book! "
2022,Karyn,Kept me in suspense the whole book. Loved it. 
2023,Kerry Ellis,"I couldn't put this book down, loved reading it"
2024,Lendoxia,"I don't usually read thrillers or am particularly interested in them but this one was really good. I get why it created a hype lately and I feel like everyone read it, like they should :) The book deals with depression, lies, abuse, alcoholism all wrapped up in a mystery of who did it? I'm glad that the end is not completely obvious from the beginning, but we gradually get more information and paint the whole picture of what actually happened."
2025,Diann Martin,this book is very clever with lots of plot twists and characters woven together -a great read and good story 
2026,Amy Schmalbach,"I was hooked from page one, which is rare - usually it takes me a little while to get familiar with the characters, the setting, the writing style, etc. Not so with this novel. I really loved the writing style and I liked the format of the book - each chapter was told in the past tense from one of the female characters' perspectives, with each day delineated like an entry in a journal. It made the events feel more real and also inevitable and the story fast-paced and suspenseful.As with many mysteries, none of the characters are quite what they first appear, and it is fascinating to be able to get to know them better and better as the story unfolds and the reader is able to see what is behind the facade of each person. The mystery is certainly secondary to the character development, but that is not at all a bad thing. The driving force behind the overarching story is Rachel, the main narrator, who is at the lowest point in her life and has an almost overwhelming desire to feel useful and involved. To all of the other characters, she is a pitiful human being and a pest, but, ironically, her peskiness and obsession with other people's lives actually ends up helping in the end.Around three quarters of the way through the book the light bulb went off and I had the basic points of the mystery figured out, which was surely intentional by the author. The suspense, however, didn't stop there; if anything, it increased, as I willed Rachel to figure it out too.This is one of those mysteries that are difficult to put down once you pick them up - it draws you in and messes with your head and has you questioning the reliability of all the characters. I look forward to reading more by this author!"
2027,Joyce,"Oh, my. This book. It's been a long time since I've read a book so suspenseful it kept me on the edge of my seat. While reading the final 50 pages, my stomach was in knots every time I got to a Rachel chapter, clenched tightly, fearing what would happen next. Oh, my, what a smart, stupid woman. She made so many poor choices, got herself into so many dangerous situations. I found myself admonishing her numerous times, ""Don't do it! Don't go over there!"" But she didn't listen, not to me, and not to her gut instincts. Her instincts were so good, so right on, and she ignored them every time. Okay, now that I've gotten that out of the way, let me take a deep breath. I should back up a bit, and say that I was unsure about this book for the first 40-45 pages. It gets off to a slow start, with nothing really happening. But, after page 50 or so, it starts to pick up speed, and by the last 50, it barrels along nonstop - much like a train picks up speed, you might say. I really appreciated the way Paula Hawkins wrote the story, alternating sections among the three women. Notice, though, that Megan's chapters are in past time, but then they have to be, don't they? And Hawkins does an exemplary job catching her story up to the climax in the real-life time of the other two characters. She is a master at building suspense. I can't wait to see what she does next."
2028,Dani Elle,couldn't put it down
2029,Randi,"I listened to this book via Audible and it was just so good! I don't do audio books very often but this was so well done. The different readers from the different perspectives did an amazing job and it helped me to get that much more interested in the book. I usually listen while I wait for my daughter to get out of school which is about 20-30 minutes a day and I just LOVE when I'm so captivated that I bring it in the house with me and try to squeeze in as much of the story as I can. (view spoiler)[You can't help but feel so sorry for Rachel and at the same time you understand everyone else's frustrations. A couple of times I wanted to smack her and say JUST REMEMBER!!! I'm glad she came to realize that everything wasn't her fault and she was at the hands of an abuser. Props to her for trying to save Anna instead of saying ""screw it, she deserves what she gets"".I really loved Megan's character. There was an underlying realness to her even though she was full of lies. Do you ever REALLY know someone? Everyone has their secrets and their quirks. I don't agree with everything she did but at the same time I can sympathize with her. Everyone has their demons and inner truths.Anna was an irritating narcissistic person and it bit her in the ass but I'm so proud of her in the end. She did what needed to happen. (hide spoiler)]I just saw yesterday that they're already in the process of making this into a movie!!! YAAAY!!! There could not have been a better choice for Rachel than Emily Blunt!! Perfect!!!I was picturing more of a Kiera Knightly for Megan but we'll see about Haley Bennett. Super excited!"
2030,Kristen Dixie,"This is an engaging and entertaining read. While on the surface it seems to be your classic thriller pushed forward by voyeurism, alcoholic blackouts and heartbreak that's become obsession, there are some really though provoking questions posed here about relationships, women's treatment and the lengths we're willing to go for our own self-interest. Do any of us know when enough is enough? "
2031,Melinda,Loved loved loved. Had me hooked from the first few pages. Even though it was essentially a 'whodunnit' is also managed to be quite character driven and I felt I really got to know Rachel. Not once before it was revealed did I guess who the killer was. 
2032,Tara,4.5 stars. A must read. Could not put it down. The girl on the train is an alcoholic mixed up in a murder mystery...a very creepy psychologic thriller!
2033,Anne Strauss,"Excellently written story of apparently ordinary people, some of whom turn out to be not chat the reader was expecting. A classic reminder that what we see on the surface is often not what lies beneath it."

Пять дней в неделю Рэйчел исправно ездит на поезде в Лондон, якобы на работу. Утренний поезд и вечерний, это все, что у нее есть.Рэйчел любит глазеть в окно поезда по разным причинам. Героями ее ежедневного железнодорожного сериала становятся супруги из дома около ж/д путей, которым она дает имена Джейсон и Джесс. У них, кажется, есть все, чего лишилась Рэйчел: семья, любовь, счастье... Но однажды происходит что-то странное, а потом Джесс пропадает.Повествование ведется от имени трех героинь: Рэйчел, Мэган и Анны. Бывшая жена, любовница, нынешняя жена... Все они связаны между собой.Каждая из них рассказывает свою историю, и у читателей есть возможность встать на место каждой героини и увидеть ситуацию с ее точки зрения.Сначала нам кажется, что с преступником все очевидно. А потом мы вместе с Рэйчел начинаем понимать, что все не так банально. И становится ясно, что кто-то тщательно пестует алкогольную зависимость Рэйчел. Кому-то нужно, чтобы она каждое утро просыпалась с чувством вины за якобы совершенные поступки...Повествование ведется в разных временных пластах. Две героини рассказывают о настоящем, а одна — о прошлом. Кроме того, есть флэшбэки для обьяснения некоторых обстоятельств действия.“Девушка в поезде” как раз тот случай, когда сюжет неожиданно делает поворот на 180 градусов. Все, чему мы верили, оказывается ложью. Я долго размышляла: о чем эта книга? О лжи, об алкоголизме, о домашнем насилии, об одиночестве... А еще о том, что все не так, как кажется.Это книга о нас. Мы стремимся создать видимость благополучия с помощью антуража: семья, дом, престижная работа... Однако, все это не гарантия счастья и взаимопонимания. Это всего лишь ширма, вид из окна проезжающего поезда.Книга читается легко, повествование ведется от первого лица. Главы носят имена героинь, которые ведут рассказ, и указан период времени, о котором идет речь.В книге есть герои первого плана, и те, кто обитает на периферии. Однако, путаницы с именами и образами не происходит. Не приходится пролистывать страницы назад, чтобы вспомнить, кто есть кто.Пола Хокинс тщательно прорисовывает образы мужчин, порой даже сравнивая их с известными актерами.Женские образы прорисованы акварелью, слегка. Полное представление о внешности Рэйчел мы получаем к концу книги.В очередной раз убеждаюсь, что детектив незаслуженно считают бульварным чтивом.Возможно, здесь нет глобальных социальных проблем, хотя, как посмотреть. Зато есть захватывающее повествование и сюжет, который вдруг переворачивается с ног на голову...Эта книга не оставит вас в покое, пока вы не узнаете правду. Всю правду. Окончательную правду."
2035,Abderrahmane Azmi,"Rachel is a depressed female Londoner who retrospectively quits the present and goes back to performing activities with her unmentioned close friends. “The Girl on the Train” by Paula Hawkins examines inebriety and domestic violence in a fully developed country; England. The intoxicated late-20s woman knows the people and Victorian houses of London “by heart”, Rachel copes with alcoholism and makes readers foreshadow the genesises of how Rachel ended up being a “black sheep”. Rachel has memorized the surroundings that are in her area; houses and people. Rachel knows houses that she passes by in the train, by heart. “Number fifteen is much like the other houses along this stretch of track: a Victorian semi, two storeys high, overlooking a narrow, well-tended garden that runs around twenty feet down towards some fencing, beyond which lie a few metres of no-man’s-land before you get to the railway track. I know this house by heart. I know every brick, I know the colour of the curtains in the upstairs bedroom (beige, with a dark-blue print), I know that the paint is peeling off the bathroom window frame and that there are four tiles missing from a section of the roof over on the right-hand side” (Hawkins 18). Rachel knows the description and habits of Jason and Jess, a couple living in the suburbia.“I know that on warm summer evenings, the occupants of this house, Jason and Jess, sometimes climb out of the large sash window to sit on the makeshift terrace on top of the kitchen-extension roof. They are a perfect, golden couple. He is dark-haired and well built, strong, protective, kind. He has a great laugh. She is one of those tiny bird-women, a beauty, pale-skinned with blond hair cropped short. She has the bone structure to carry that kind of thing off, sharp cheekbones dappled with a sprinkling of freckles, a fine jaw” (Hawkins 19). In conclusion, Rachel has conned her surroundings.Signs of intoxication begin to become evident, Rachel begins adumbrating how she’s committed something louche. Rachel is frequently inebriated. “I open one of the bottles of Chenin Blanc I purchased from the Whistletop at Euston. It’s not cold, but it’ll do. I pour some into a plastic cup, screw the top back on and slip the bottle into my handbag. It’s less acceptable to drink on the train on a Monday, unless you’re drinking with company, which I am not” (Hawkins 21). Rachel makes readers foreshadow that she has perpetrated a disreputable act, that she’s a pariah. “I don't know whether they see me, though, for what I really am” (Hawkins 21). To conclude, Rachel gets intoxicated and makes readers hint at her commitment of something disreputable.The suspicion begins to clarify and Rachel's train advances to another area at London. The foreshadowing increases while Rachel says that the pile of clothes from last week is still there, and it looks dustier and more forlorn than it did a few days ago. “The pile of clothes from last week is still there, and it looks dustier and more forlorn than it did a few days ago” (Hawkins 23). Rachel’s train went from the suburbs of London to somewhere else. The train went from the suburbia of Victorian houses to grimy North London the closer to Euston, the more anxious Rachel feels. The doubts are increasing, Rachel’s mobile dwelling, proceeds to another setting.The melancholia of Rachel worsens and worsens with incremental alcohol habits. An important event will occur in North London, (foreshadowing it). The intoxicated late-20s woman knows the people and Victorian houses of London “by heart”, Rachel copes with alcoholism and makes readers foreshadow the genesises of how Rachel ended up being an outcast. May 10th, 2015From the simple quote by D.H. Sidebottom, ""Stars can't shine without darkness"", Rachel needs to overcome her research for happiness by simply dwelling in a ""dark, nonchalant"" world without Scott as a left shoulder devil, with the darkness, Rachel, can shine by continuing a prosperous life at her office. Paula Hawkins' psychological novel examines a mid 30s, constantly inebriated woman that spills the truth, bit by bit, about how Scott, an ex-partner, diverged and went his own way. At first, Rachel discovers her reproduction-related handicap and despairs, then gets interrogated by a curious police officer, and finally gets legally warned to not approach certain people, and gets jealous about the way Scott moved on.The providence of Rachel loses hope by discovering that a main element of ongoing life is disabled. Rachel is barren, or cannot be impregnated, she is shocked about the fact that it's her ""fault"" and not her sexually productive ex-partner's. ""It didn't happen. No doctor has been able to explain to me why I can't get pregnant. I'm young, fit enough, I wasn't drinking heavily when we were trying. My husband's sperm was active and plentiful"" (Hawkins 125). Rachel shows that she is providentially blinded by the moms and their children she sees in the supermarket she goes to. The protagonist says that she was better now, because before, jealousy would manipulate her into leaving the supermarket. In conclusion, Rachel is hindered by the fact that can't reproduce.The police officer is suspecting that Rachel is not claiming any truthful fact about the occurrence and therefore elongated the expected timing of the interrogation. Riley, the police officer at the station suspected that Rachel is lying about what happened with her traitor's baby and wife, guessed because of her evident, previous drunkenness. "" Well, I love to say that to me, your behavior suggests that-as Mrs. Watson implied-you are unwilling to move on"" (Hawkins 132). Riley and Gaskill want to dig deep, ""behind"" and not ""on"" the investigation of the disappearance of Megan Watson, they don't want to feel remorse afterwards, if Rachel commits suicide out of depression or disappears too, out of dissatisfaction. Rachel even mocks Riley about not having better things to do like investigating on the disappearance rather than questioning an innocent woman. In conclusion, Rachel leaves by ignoring Riley but by shaking Gaskill's hand. The barren woman gets warned about contacting the suspects and reads through articles, retrospecting about her glorious past with Scott. Gaskill warns Rachel to not approach her ex-partner and a suspicious road that might be an opposing weapon to Rachel. ""Don't contact your ex-husband unless... Don't go anywhere near Blenheim road (Hawkins 136). The articles are being read and covetousness is being felt about how she and Scott were intimate and happy together but ended up losing every mutuality. David Clark, from the Daily Mail refers to Megan and Scott as having been a great couple and always happy together. To conclude, Rachel gets warned but ""cheats"" by reading the articles.Rachel Watson has reached the truth as to where the readers can guess that Rachel's entourage is inactive and unmentioned because of her drinking habits. At first, Rachel discovers her reproduction-related handicap and despairs, then gets interrogated by a curious police officer, and finally gets legally warned to not approach certain people, and gets jealous about the way Scott moved on. For an advice, as a result, an individual needs to live happily and destroy any hinting sign of future discontent."
2036,Pooja Nair,Makes for a nice racy read!
2037,Red Iza,"Reviewed for http://theereaderjunkie.wordpress.comRate 4.5 rounded up to 5Featured image This book was all “the” buzz a few months ago, it’s been reviewed almost everywhere and as I closed it a few seconds before typing this, I can see clearly why. It’s a very good psychological suspense and you can’t drop it until the last page. Four of my coworkers are waiting for it and I’m not even mentioning the readers of my library who have already asked for it !Huge success, then, so why didn’t I give it a 5 ? Because there was a little “déjà vu” element for me. The main character who was too drunk to remember what really happened “that” night, I’ve read it before, simple as that. But I gave it a 4.5 anyway because the psychology of the characters is soooo very good.I couldn’t relate to any of them, but I sympathized with all the women at a moment or another : Rachel, who can be disgusting yet touching ; Megan, such a butterfly but who experienced such tragedy ; Anne, who stole another woman’s husband and is trying hard to make herself believe that she leads a wonderful life. The story also showed how some men can manipulate women into believing that the way they treat them is acceptable, while it’s absolutely not.All in all, it was an excellent book and I probably wouldn’t have been slightly (very slightly !) disappointed if it hadn’t been for all this buzz around it. Highly recommended ! "
2038,Jayme Burke,"Whatttt! This book blew my mind. I thought as the book went a long I was totally figuring everything out, but then the ending I had it all wrong!The Girl on the Train is written from 3 different People. Rachel, the drunk, Megan the missing girl, and Anna the mistress turned wife. If you liked Gone Girl than you will love The Girl on The Train. "
2039,Deleana,"I just finished The Girl on the Train. It got five stars from me because it kept my attention making it hard to drag myself away from it to take care of other responsibilities. In the genre of Gone Girl, the story is based on a whodunit. However, the initial twenty pages or so may make you think ""Chick Lit"" because the story line dwells on one person's remorse over a lost marriage. If you like mysteries, hang in there. The wait is worth it. I think there's going to be a movie so read fast."
2040,Vanessa,I really enjoyed this book...it left me guessing until the end. Quite dark perspective from the viewpoint of an alcoholic but not depressing.
2041,Gillian Shaw,"I put it in the ""stay up all night to finish"" category. Obsession at its best "
2042,Waode Heni,"Another sick debut novel after Andrea Bustfield's. Really. I do not even have any favorite character. They're all lame. The story gave me some times of a sweet sensation of shadenfreude, tho. One of the reason why I love psy-thriller genre."
2043,Sunniva Leseth,"This is my favorite book, it is the most addicting and exciting book I have ever read. I believe I finished it after just a couple of days reading. Some people who have read this will problably say they don't like the main character Rachel, I on the other hand kinda love her. Even though she is an alcoholic person who just can't get her life right I really like her. This book made me angry at times, and I could seriously not leave it. The book also had me mindblown more than once, and after this I can't get enough of thrillers. "
2044,Jill,"Rachel is the girl on the train who rides daily on the 8:04 from her flat into London to a job she no longer holds. For months she has been hiding the truth that she was fired from her job after getting drunk during a business lunch and insulting a client. Her life has spiraled into drunken despair after her marriage dissolved due to her alcohol abuse, exacerbated by her inability to conceive a baby, and her husband's infidelity. Her daily train journey takes her right through the back yard of the house on Blenheim Road where she used to live with her husband Tom, now his home with his new wife Anna and baby Evie. Rachel also watched from the train another apparently happy couple who live just down the street - she calls them Jason and Jess.When Jess (whose real name is Megan) goes missing, Rachel inserts herself into the story by contacting Jason (whose real name is Scott) to tell him that she had seen Megan kissing another man in the backyard. She lied to Scott, telling him that she had met Megan several times at her gallery. The mystery of Megan's disappearance is told in chapters that alternate between first-person accounts of Rachel, Megan and Anna. At different points throughout the novel, you suspect almost every character of being the possible killer; though by the last 10-15% of the novel, ""whodunit"" becomes clear, and it's just a matter of tying up the loose ends and proving that person is the culprit.The plot was entertaining and detailed enough, but none of the characters are particularly likable or appealing - they all have annoying character defects, and they're all liars. Rachel is a pathetic alcoholic, unable to pull herself out of her deep pool of self-pity. Even her flatmate, Cathy, whose ""niceness is writ large"", is an enabler who puts up with Rachel's out of control drunken behavior. By the end of the novel, when the killer was identified and dealt with, I was just glad it was over!"
2045,Liz Barnsley,"Full feature here in the first of my ""Spotlight 2015"" features for my blog.http://lizlovesbooks.com/lizlovesbook...Review Text:So in the first of my ""Spotlight 2015"" features coming up over the next few weeks, I'm taking look at ""The Girl on the Train"" by Paula Hawkins - a tense and highly addictive thriller that will almost certainly keep you turning the pages well into the night in order to discover just what the outcome is for Rachel, Jason and Jess.Rachel has problems, is a highly intriguing character and when we meet her she is on a train. The same train she gets every day, seeing the same things she sees every day - until one day she observes something unusual. This sets her on a path of discovery and on a journey towards destruction.The whole thing is really excellent - the writing flows along, the characters pop and once you start it is very hard to put aside - one of those ""just one more chapter then I'll load the dishwasher"" type books that basically means the dishwasher is going to be rather lonely for a while...I particularly liked (or actually actively disliked at times) Rachel - who because of her background, is difficult to get a grasp on. Are there nefarious things going on or is it just her? Her dogged determination and often rather obscure decision making means that almost anything could be true and this is where the plot is intelligent, creative and why the whole novel is so addictive. Add to Rachel some other characters who may or may not be as they appear, including Rachel's seemingly reasonable ex husband, the couple who Rachel avidly observes from her train seat and various others and you have a most terrific mix which creates a character driven thriller of top notch quality.Overall this is definitely one to look out for in the early months of 2015 and would definitely be a great book to get you over those ""End of Holiday"" blues once Christmas and New Year is over and done with - you'll soon get caught up in Rachel's world and this is a tremendously fun read with a dark heart and a great ending.Highly Recommended"
2046,LeeAnn Heringer,"I see why everyone suggests 'Girl On The Train' if you've read 'Gone Girl'. The shifting perspective, the unreliable narrators, the betrayal of trust, and the vulnerability of marriage. The mystery is held to the end and is a surprise, the true villain was unexpected for me (because of course by the time you get to the end, you've passed through a number of suspects). It was very well-written.But.... Every women in this book would be someone that I would cross the street to avoid in real life. All of them well written, excellently described, expertly rendered, completely annoying personalities. Though when bad things happen to them, you don't really fear for their safety. I read it in a single sitting on the plane from the east to west coast and it pulled me along. It would be a good beach read."
2047,Angela Shrum,Couldn't put it down and am so happy with the end result! I give it ALL OF THE STARS! Absolutely loved it!
2048,Chris Keen,omg fantastic book a story that gripped me from beginning to end i read it in 2 days n ive recommemd it to friends
2049,Lara Van Hulzen,"This book is appropriately titled because it's like watching a train wreck - you simply can't look away. Mesmerized from the beginning, I could not put the book down until I was finished. I HAD to know the end. One review I read called it ""Hitchcockian"" and I could not agree more. It reminded me of the movie Rear Window. Told from three different women's points of view, The Girl On The Train is a suspense thriller at it's finest. I am a character driven reader and writer and the characters in this book are written brilliantly. Rachel is a literal train wreck herself but the author wrote her in such a way that I felt sorry enough for her to want to know her story. And I really wanted things to work out for her. The other characters were so full of mystery and intrigue I felt unease about each one, never truly knowing them or what they would do next. And I loved how the book ended. The author didn't leave the reader with frustrating unknowns but wraps it up in a way where I was satisfied but can't stop thinking about the story. Brilliant. Excellent read. "
2050,Caron Ervin,I listened to the audio of this book and enjoyed it tremendously. Great voices for the characters. Superbly written! I'll be watching closely for her next book. 
2051,Hilary Kotecki,"As soon as I finished this book, I walked into the local bookstore where I work and told the owner that this book was going to be the next Gone Girl. Don't let that comparison fool you - this is no copycat effort!Rachel is an alcoholic whose roommate has no idea that she no longer has a job, because each day she continues to commute to work on the train that goes past the house and neighborhood where she used to live. In her mind, she has built a life story for the people who live a few houses from her ex--husband, and each day, she adds a bit more. One day, she sees the woman who lives there with a man who is not her husband...and a few days later, this woman disappears.You can't say much more than that without spoiling the whole kit and caboodle, but suffice it to say that I find it difficult to believe that Paula Hawkins is making her fictional debut with this novel, because it reeks of the type of professional plotting and twisting of readers' minds that generally can only be found in the work of well-established authors. I don't think that the thriller genre will ever quite escape the Gone Girl comparisons, but when I reached the ending, I can honestly say that this novel should stand on equal footing. Well-plotted, brilliantly told, and page-turningly gripping, you won't regret the time you spend with The Girl on the Train."
2052,Rachael Salinas,Wow! This book takes so many twists. It kept surprising me all the way through the last chapter. So unexpected! 
2053,Jackie,One of the most refreshing novels I have read in a while. It lived up to the hype. How could this be the author's first novel?
2054,Rose (littlebookowl75),"WHOA!!! This book!!! It was such a good read! It had me up late reading until the wee hours of the morning! I simply couldn't put it down! The two main female characters are twisted, evil, and possibly crazy! I don't want to give too much away! This story does flip back and forth between the two main female characters, Megan and Rachel. Eventually a third character POV is brought in through some of the later chapters! This book is everything you could want from a good thriller, creepy, crazy, twisted, and plot twists you won't see coming! This is a must read! Go and read this book! I loved it!!! Haven't read a thriller in a while and this one did not disappoint!"
2055,Laine Bergeson,"I expected to like this book in appropriate measure to its popularity, which is to say, I thought it would be just fine. Like, you know, easy to read, goes down quick (like Vino Verde), has a bit of voyeurism and mystery and human brokenness and redemption. It was all those things, but it was also more: an exploration of the lies we tell ourselves, an honest portrait of the ugly and complicated ways we try to pave over our pain, and a meditation on the ways memory gets distorted to suit our preferred world view . So it was good. I totally think you should read it. "
2056,Stella,"If you haven't read it, do."
2057,Jessy,"¡Genial libro! No podía dejar de leerlo.. Me gustó mucho, me cautivo desde el principio y no podía dejar de pensar en teorías sobre quién había sido, pero no me había esperado ese desenlace *w* "
2058,Lori Miller,If you want a roller coaster ride this is your book. Poor Rachel cannot let go of the past or her ex-husband who has married and fathered a child with his mistress. Every day Rachel rides the train past her old home that she once shared with Tom. The whole book she pines for Tom and delves deeper into alcoholism. She fixates on a beautiful married couple who drink wine in the sun on the porch. She creates fictitious names for them and looks forward to seeing them as one would fixate on their favorite television couple. Nothing is as perfect as it seems. This book teaches you that you never know what is really going on in someone else's seemingly perfect life.
2059,Alanna,Read this is one sitting. Enough said.
2060,Delaney Diamond,"I love a good suspense/psychological thriller, and this one more than satisfied that craving. I was glued to the pages of this book. Warning: the story unfolds slowly, but the slow progression allowed my apprehension to build until the final scenes. I have to say, I was surprised by the ending and the guilty party. The author really sucks you in, and I appreciated getting the different POVs, each person adding another little piece to the puzzle. "
2061,Christel,Wow! Intense! I couldn't put it down!
2062,Knit Spirit,"Rachel prend le train tous les jours pour aller et revenir de Londres. Elle en profite pour observer les maisons le long de la voie ferrée et inventer la vie de leurs occupants. Le jour où elle apprend la disparition d'une des habitantes, tout va basculer.Ce livre est un des meilleurs thrillers que j'ai pu écouter jusqu'à présent. Dès le départ, l'histoire m'a emportée et elle ne m'a pas lâchée. Le suspens m'a tenue en haleine de bout en bout. J'ai adoré le style d'écriture et aussi la façon dont le livre est lu : 3 voix, une pour chacune des protagonistes. Je me suis beaucoup attachée aux personnages, notamment celui de Rachel. C'est un gros gros coup de coeur !!!En bref : à lire / écouter de toute urgence !"
2063,Egita,"Mmm, šis bija spīdoši. Varbūt nedaudz par ātru es sapratu, kas ir vainīgais. Vairāk gan pēc loģiskiem apsvērumiem, ne pēc iespējamiem motīviem, bet, protams, ka tas netraucēja steigties uz grāmatas noslēgumu, lai visi punkti uz i saliktos. Burvīgi. Apsolu sev pārlasīt, kad grāmata iznāks latviski. "
2064,Amy Breihan,Entertaining quick read. 
2065,Sara Vessichelli,Great book!
2066,Patricia Revzin,"Be prepared for a very unreliable and usually inebriated narrator, false, false perceptions, tangled webs, red herrings, secrets revealed, and an unexpected ending in this suspenseful psychological thriller. Of the three narrators (Rachel, Megan, and Anna), Rachel is my favorite even though she is depressed, overweight, unemployed, unattractive, and full of self-pity. She rides daily on a train from her flat-share to London to keep up a pretense of still working (she was canned for being drunk). An unreliable narrator who has an imagination that frequently goes into overdrive, she makes up names and a fantasy life for two young and beautiful people whom she sees from her window on the train when it stops daily at her former neighborhood. She names the couple ""Jess and Jason"" and is convinced they are the perfect couple. One day when she sees ""Jess"" kissing a man on her terrace who is not ""Jason,"" Rachel impetuously gets off the train to investigate. But she falls in the underpass, unable to remember what really happened when she awakens the next morning. Recurring motifs of a blue dress, a red-haired man, and the underpass haunt Rachel as she tries to recall that night. She sees a news brief and a photo of ""Jess"" (who is really Megan) and learns that she has disappeared last night. Rachel takes it upon herself to get involved in the case.This psychological and suspenseful thriller involves characters whose perceptions are influenced by their flawed personalities. Rachel is divorced from Tom, who is now married to a more glamorous and beautiful wife and is a father of a young daughter. Jealous and lonely, Rachel can't stop herself from harassing them by calling Tom on his cell and landline, usually when she is drunk.Megan is the second narrator and her account is of necessity in the past. She reveals a sordid past and true nature, which is so different from what Rachel has imagined. And Anna is the third narrator, who vacillates from being incensed by Rachel's intrusions to doing what needs to be done under extenuating circumstances at the end of the book.When you think things can't get worse, they do. Hawkins leads the reader to and unexpected and thrilling ending that makes the whole ""ride"" so worthwhile. Fans of Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn will enjoy this novel."
2067,Mauro,"Un gran bel thriller, ricco di colpi di scena e con una storia ben raccontata. Un po' facile capire chi è il colpevole forse, ma ciò non toglie nulla alla qualità (alta) del libro. Ti prende da subito e non ti molla, consigliatissimo."
2068,Cheryl Evans,"Highly addicting. The characters are interesting. You learn the story from several different angles and really don't know ""who dun it"" until the very end. I listened to the audio version and it was very well read."
2069,Jack Okorn,I don't normally read much off of any best selling lists. I think most times it is a lot of hype to get a book sold. But I took a chance with this one and I could not put it down. Each chapter is brilliantly written and will pull you into the next chapter. Just when I thought I knew who did the deed I was shifted to another suspect. I have been on a few trains in my life and when you read this book you will feel that you are sitting right next to the person. I have to give this one FIVE STARS! I will be looking for more to come from this great author. 
2070,Amir Gadhvi,"""The Girl on the Train"" is the fastest selling Adult Novel in history.I just finished it recently...but let me tell you...it is Paula Hawkins' first book and an addictive, page turning thriller, not an easy book to put down.It's also not an easy book to review without going into spoilers so I'll just say this much.Its a fantastic thriller with shades of Hitchcock and a twisted ending. Even Stephen King has become a fan after reading the book.Hawkins' writing is excellent, and it also felt like I was watching a movie...but in prose!In fact Dreamworks Studios has already bought the rights to the book to make into a film, to be directed by Tate Taylor (The Help) and has already approached British actor Emily Blunt for the lead role."
2071,Sian,"From Rebel AngelThis was another advance copy from NetGalley and will be available to buy on the 15th January, so make sure to remember that (or pre-order it!) if you like the sound of it!I read the blurb for The Girl on the Train on NetGalley and clicked to request it as quickly as possible. Why? Because it was compared to Gone Girl and had been reviewed very positively by S. J. Watson, author of another of my favourites, Before I Go To Sleep. In the past I've chosen books based on their apparent similarities to old favourites - sometimes I'm disappointed, sometimes not; this time it was definitely a not disappointed.The story is told from varying points of view, but our main character is Rachel - a woman who commutes daily on the train into London, watching the commuters around her and staring at the houses as she passes. There is one in particular that has always piqued her interest where the train stops at a signal every day, and the people that live there interest her even more, in fact she gives them names and imagines the perfect life they have. It isn't until one day when she sees something that turns this imaginary life on its head that we realise all is not as it seems, even (or perhaps especially) in Rachel's life. She feels it's her duty to report what she's seen to the police, but it only serves to make things worse for her, dragging her ex-husband with his new wife and baby into the picture too.There is of course the twist you always expect in a psychological thriller, and while it wasn't for me as huge as the likes of a Gillian Flynn novel, it was definitely still a good one. The characters in the book are fascinating because not one of them was particularly likable, and at different times you suspect them all of different things. And of course, it's one of those books you can't describe without giving anything away , so I'll try to be brief - this was a very good read, one of my favourites in a long time, and I'd definitely recommend it. It isn't yet available for another week, but if you're interested, pre-order it so you don't forget!!"
2072,Paula,The book was very enticing. I didn't want to stop reading. What a great mystery as well as a drama of what we sometimes think of other people. Even the ones closest to us can have totally opposite outlooks from what we believe. I thoroughly enjoyed this book!
2073,Dara Lewis,"Gripping! Didn't want to put it down when I had to, yet wanted to put it down when I had time. I was so conflicted over the characters-loving and hating them from one page to the next. One question tho'...whatever happened to the red-haired man from the train?"
2074,Birgitvg,Leest als een trein.
2075,Marion Considine,"brilliant, Thank you Paula Hawkins, got my mojo back"
2076,Jordan Zweigoron,"Very different kind of read. Simple writing, not much derp character development, but a very active and engaging storytelling style. A mystery in a more Hitchcock style. Highly recommend."
2077,JANET,"I ordered the book from Amazon and it came in the mail a few days ago. In the beginning chapters, I was confused on the characters however; the flow of the reading was intriguing, with great suspense. I loved hearing the Audio of the trailer. Excellent book."
2078,Jannie,"Now this is more like it. This thriller was indeed that and more. Just because I raced through this in one feverish afternoon and early evening does not mean that I skimmed the thing. Many times I had to go back and re-read a passage, not because it was unclear or convoluted, but because the writing was so damned dazzling.Rachel is a drunk. Her husband left her for another woman. Divorced, a friend has taken her in. She lost her job months ago when she insulted a client during an especially wine-soaked lunch, but cannot bring herself to tell her flatmate (or truly face it herself) so she takes the train to and from London every day, as if she were still punching the clock. The train she rides goes past the house she shared with her ex-husband; indeed, he lives there still with his new wife and their infant daughter. Rachel not only keeps an eye on them as the train trundles past but also on a couple a few doors down, concocting stories in her head about who they are and the charmed life she believes them to live. When the wife goes missing, she feels she knows enough about them to insinuate herself into the investigation. ""How much better life must have been for jealous drunks before emails and texts and mobile phones, before all this electronica and the traces it leaves.""I will not spoil anything here, I feel strongly that it’s worth going into more blind than not. I will say that Rachel’s trajectory was fascinating and complex, with the queasiness and unreliable memory a couple of bottles of wine or several canned gin and tonics can bring.A solid debut."
2079,Amber Brackin,# a book set in another country loved this one! kept me busy trying to solve the mystery myself... of course I was wrong lol
2080,Princess Joy,"Amazing, nail biting page turner I couldn't put down for 4 days. I fell in love with poor, messed up Rachel and her inner thoughts and dreams. She's so human, so raw, so weakened by loss, you can't help but love her. And the supporting characters are all excellent. Wonderful writing, moving plot, and the ending was satisfying and spectacular! It read like an action movie, with plenty of lovely suspense. The first 50 pages go slow, so hang on, it get's really good as it moves on.I enjoyed Hawkens writing immensely, she has a great way of storytelling with words that is both fanciful but somehow visceral and real. Great read, worth it."
2081,Carajcohen,"I could not put this book down. I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next and every time I thought I had figured out what was going on, I was wrong. I've heard this book compared to Gone Girl, but I disagree. Although it's hard to say that each character in this book is likable, I did find myself interested in each character at different times throughout this story.I literally could not put this book down and found myself up too late at night reading it."
2082,Adam Silvera,"NO SPOILERS BELOW!I loved the hell out of THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN. I closed it and said ""THAT was a fucking book."" To myself. Out loud. The characters were so damn flawed and shady and had very honest, usually unspoken human thoughts. The structure initially had me nervous, but it ultimately paid off for me once I kept track of the dates. As far as super-hyped thrillers go, I'll admit I loved GONE GIRL a little bit more, but I found both books equally addicting. ALSO: how insane is it that I get to put THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN on my 2015 Debut shelf? Pretty damn insane. I would like the film adaptation now, please. "
2083,Trish Gibowicz,Page-turner. Couldn't put it down.
2084,Ali Murphy,"I put this book down and exhaled a big ""Oy, that was good."" I enjoyed Hawkins writing and the story was utterly absorbing. I thought I might get annoyed with Rachel's drinking and blacking out, but Hawkins painted her with such a subtle brush that I really felt for her. I wanted her to be okay, I wanted her to get it together. Hawkins managed to write all three women in the story so that their weaknesses and pathologies were relatable and engrossing. I had the hardest time with Anna, but Hawkins managed to walk the line, so that the ending was both believable and very, very satisfying to the reader. This is already a runaway hit - you cannot go wrong with this highly entertaining read."
2085,Quill,"I read the **** out of this book. Took me about 5 hours. Don't make the mistake of not reading it, 'kay?"
2086,Morgan Daversa,"This author is a master at creating tension and suspense. I didn't really know what this book was about, well, I vaguely knew. Turned out to be a fun ride, and I'm left wishing it was still going. I thought the the plot was brilliantly executed and the characters, while not necessarily likable, were quite compelling. I grew more and more sympathetic to the main character as the story went on. This is was a page turner from start to finish. "
2087,Laura Grable,"It's been a long time since I completed a whole book in a weekend, but I simply couldn't put this book down. Needless to say, I really enjoyed it. I thought it was much more Rear Window than Gone Girl. At first Rachel's unreliability was a narrator was a little frustrating, but I don't think it took away from the suspense of the book. It also didn't bother me that all the characters were pretty hard to like because it made them all interesting suspects. From the beginning, with Rachel seeing the same people from the train every day and wondering about their their lives, it sucked me in, made me wonder about their back stories, and ruined my weekend productivity. I don't mind though, I thought it was a satisfying read and, as I mentioned before, it's been a long time since I literally could not put a book down. Sometimes that's a great way to spend a weekend. I'm just a little sad the story 's over."
2088,Jenni Jay," The Girl on the TrainThis books was amazing. Every review I read about it was absolutely correct. I could not wait to find out who did it! Every time you think you know who did it, you question your decision. So many possibilities. If you liked Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn or Big Little Lies by Liane Moriarty you will definitely enjoy this great read.Summary:Three women, three men, connected through marriage or infidelity. Each is to blame for something. But only one is a killer in this nail-biting, stealthy psychological thriller about human frailty and obsession.  Just what goes on in the houses you pass by every day?  Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning and evening, rattling over the same junctions, flashing past the same townhouses.The train stops at the same signal every day, and she sees the same couple, breakfasting on their roof terrace. Jason and Jess, as she calls them, seem so happy. Then one day Rachel sees someone new in their garden. Soon after, Rachel sees the woman she calls Jess on the news. Jess has disappeared.  Through the ensuing police investigation, Rachel is drawn deeper into the lives of the couple she learns are really Megan and Scott Hipwell. As she befriends Scott, Rachel pieces together what really happened the day Megan disappeared. But when Megan's body is found, Rachel finds herself the chief suspect in the case. Plunged into a world of betrayals, secrets and deceptions, Rachel must confront the facts about her own past and her own failed marriage.  A sinister and twisting story that will keep you guessing at every turn, The Girl on the Train is a high-speed chase for the truth."
2089,Kristina,Nothing more than what it claims to be: a thriller to keep you guessing! 
2090,Diona Atkins,"Great book, had me intrigued really early, couldn't put it down!If you like a little mystery and some twists this is a good chic lit book for you"
2091,Viviana,Review on the blog! :)https://enchantingwolf.wordpress.com/...
2092,Maggie Kiely,I purchased this as an audiobook due to its popularity and hype. I felt the varied narratives were excellent and really aided the story. This book has been compared to ‘Before I go to Sleep’ and ‘Gone Girl’ both of which I read. I thought they were a load of rubbish. I was unsure whether to read it or not but I can gladly say that this book was far superior to the other two and I would not compare them in any way.  This proved to be a really interesting story and I felt the author developed it well. The characters were well rounded and interesting. Yes the character of Rachel was very annoying and some of her actions beggars belief. It is patently obvious from the outset that there is more to the story. Although the plot plus the antagonist is easy to guess I still really enjoyed it. I felt that all loose ends were cleared up nicely at the end although I was sorry when it came. I would add my voice to those who recommend it. I eagerly await the next novel by this author. 
2093,Lavon Koenig,Suspenseful.Suspenseful read. Didn't want to put it down. Good development of characters. Had to make a list of characters to keep them straight.
2094,A.L.,"This is a book I looked forward to reading when I went to bed. Lately, I've had a hard time finding a book I could really get into. I rarely get past the first chapter anymore, but this book got to me. I write, and this is the way I want to write. It's not an easy read, but it's honest and I believed it. The three women telling the story speak honestly about the way they feel. They are not totally likeable, but that didn't stop me from investing myself in their narratives. The story is about a woman named Rachel, whose life is very small. She rides the train each day and as she passes houses near the tracks, she ""adopts"" a couple she sees at one house and creates a story for them. They are happy, in love, and perfect. Rachel drinks too much, is divorced, and the train also passes her former residence where her ex-husband and his new wife and daughter live. The pain of that failed marriage has broken her, and the only thing that brings her up is thinking about the imaginary lives of the perfect couple, whom she has dubbed Jess and Jason. One day Jess disappears, sending Rachel into a tailspin. She had seen Jess in the back yard kissing another man, and since she cannot believe Jason could hurt his wife, Rachel begins to believe that the ""other man"" must have done something to her. The decisions she makes during this time are colored by the alcohol she consumes and can only lead to disaster. I kept wanting to lock her in a room so she couldn't do the things she was going to do. Rachel has also lost a chunk of time while drunk and can recall only bits and pieces of that time. She struggles to remember what happened, believing it may hold the key to what happened to ""Jess,"" a woman she now knows was named Megan. The three women: Rachel, Megan, and Anna, the wife of Rachel's ex-husband, narrate the story, giving us the action from each of their perspectives. I didn't see the end coming until I was near the end, and that doesn't happen very often. I gave it five stars because I did think it was amazing. "
2095,Ariel Jeinar,"I think I'm into psychologically-disturbed individuals lately. This one here did not come close to the last one I read but that one was on the extreme side of things.When I first heard this book, I never thought it'd be some sort of a thriller and that's because I did not bother to read the summary at the back. Well, I like to be surprised. And I was.This book drove me nuts so as to putting off sleeping just to finish it. It's that good, for me at least. Made my brain hurt when the whole and true story unraveled but I did manage to get myself going again.There's this one part where I literally gasped in the middle of the night and freaking looked around the room to check that I was alone. I'll give this book a go if I were you."
2096,Kristina-katharina,So exciting. wow - I would have never guessed this ending. great book !
2097,S,"Dear Paula Hawkins, 	There was a time back in high school and college where psycho thrillers, action-suspense, and medical thrillers were my 'thing'. I fell in love with Mary Higgins Clark,Sidney Sheldon, Robin Cook, Jeffery Deaver, et.al. Thinking about it now, I can't seem to recall the time when I had decided to try something new until I unknowingly fall apart from the aforementioned genres. Cop out as it may sound but it really had nothing to do with the genre or the authors, it was all me. As a reader, I'm like a sponge. I absorb. I think it is also a prerequisite for readers to have an active imagination and so I also have that thing going. I gave myself the longest possible break from thrillers until The Girl on the Train. 	I should be mad at you right now (or yesterday – the day the finished your book) for the mind-boggling and mind-fucking experience but I am not. The only thing I'm mad about is that my pride is bruised. I had 'it' figured out just a little over 70% of the book. For me, that took quite a little too long. That goes without saying then that you are a great master at what you're doing and there's no hint of doubt or whatsoever why your book was chosen as one of the best last year (2015). Instead of getting mad at you, I should thank you for bringing me back to one of my first loves (putting it like this doesn't sound right but whatever. Hah!) I have to admit that it took me a while to finish your book because the first few chapters were quite a battle to me. Rachel's character initially came out too strong (oh the irony) and there might have been a little transference going on so I needed a breather. It was a good call. I tried my best to detach myself from the characters you have masterfully created and although I couldn't say I was winning all the time, I haved loved every page of The Girl on the Train.	Realizations? Well I have plenty but I'd just focus on one:	 Our weaknesses are not supposed to define us. No matter how many times we have been down at the bottom, barely able to get up and get going. No matter how many times we fail, it has become a vicious cycle... The highlight of this part of our life should be at the time we realize we still have the strength to put an end to something that feeds our weaknesses. In all of the Rachels we have in us, may we have a Cathy to help us push through. And Rachel was not the weakest to begin with. She was made to believe she was lacking and not worth it. So whatever you're going through right now, don't let someone make you believe you won't make it. Have faith in yourself. Because. You. Are. Fucking. Worth. It.Your happy reader,S	*****HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
2098,Veronica Bohanna,Enjoyed this book. Plot slowly revealed.
2099,Ghada,"Would you ever look at other people lives the same way again? would you be able to trust anybody even your own personal version of past events anymore? Who is the culprit and who is the victim in this entangled web of lies, cheating and drunkenness? A true page turner, if you got nothing you can't help but finish it eat it all up in one sitting. The way she was capable of dissecting the characters inner feelings and expressing them out was amazed me. She was like examining each one of them under a powerful magnifying microscope reaching deep into their inner core. You would think that the book's structure narrating mostly characters inner thoughts might be boring but in this book there is not a boring second, it keeps you on edge till the end. The twist is just perfect, it will keep you guessing a good long time. Indeed it's depressing,I presume it can touch most readers on a personal level, hurting deep proving how realistic and perfectly woven it is. Maybe the similarities with Gone Girl is the missing girl , the way of telling the story from different perspectives and the fact that you don't really know the truth of the people you share your life with, otherwise I don't see a comparison ground. I give it the full five stars in this thrillers category, other contemporary novels or non fiction memoirs could have more literature value compared to it, but in its category this book earns the full five stars. "
2100,Steph Myers,"OMG! This was not marked ""currently reading"" for long. What a page-turner! I can see why it gets compared to Gone Girl. I found my allegiances to characters going back and forth. It will make a better movie than Gone Girl. I'm sure someone will make it into a movie. It certainly moves like a train. Sort of slow for the first few pages then it roars along heading straight for a brick wall. It's one of those books that makes you feel a little sad about society in general - (Are we all just crazy/broken in our own ways?), but it's such a good story . . ."
2101,Maggie,"This. Was. Awesome! I had heard comparisons to Gone Girl, which I loved, and I HATE comparisons because typically I wind up being very disappointed. This is totally different than GG, but has the same elements of suspense, done perfectly by my standards. Love the alternate points of view of the 3 women embroiled in the story and how they are weaved together. The premise is fantastic - alcoholic sitting on train fantasizes about her old married wonderful life and the lives of other happy people who have taken her place or just random strangers who appear happy, but are those people truly happy? What do you find inside the house? What I love is that I'm a people watcher too (no, not in a creeper way). But I've often sat and wondered about people, ok neighbors - are they really that happy? Is the guy standoffish for a reason? And of course, we've ALL wondered about the ""quiet guy who keeps to himself"" (note description of every serial killer I can think of). So I found the premise intriguing - simply looking out a train window and what do you see....??? I didn't care for Rachel (protag.) at first, but grew to respect her more as the story continued. It was VERY realistic. I know MANY people burned badly in divorce usually due to infidelity and that ""moving on"" part is so difficult. UGH.. that part was written incredibly well. The other 2 women - not as interesting, but I did like the suspense created by switching perspectives. One of my top books I've read in a while. No doubt!"
2102,Ben Tilton,"Entertaining ReadI enjoyed the way the story unfolded over the course of the book, picking up pace and suspense like a quickening train bolting through a tunnel. The author toyed with me and kept me guessing like a great mystery ""whodunnit"" should do. It made it all the more satisfying when I solved the puzzle. "
2103,Brian Fehrle,"So I decided to read this simply because it hit the best sellers list. I'm not one to consume media simply because of popularity, if anything I avoid it. I like to consume based on its merits, the content, the story, the artwork itself, not the hype. I've learned not to trust people, but rather trust the artist. But regardless of my disposition to the idea, I saw this book all over the place for a solid month or two, and when it came time to chose a new book, I chose this one. I knew NOTHING about it, other than the title. But it was a gamble, a toss of the dice of which I didn't know I had. Boy I'm glad I tossed them.The book was thrilling, depressing, dark and dreary, subtle, heart-wrenching. This is the first story of any kind that I can honestly say that I disliked most every character in the story, usually to the point of hatred and screaming at the book itself, angry at the choices they made. Yet, with such disdain towards the characters through the book, I couldn't put it down. It was like the overused colloquialism of 'like watching a train wreck', where it's horrible and appalling, but I couldn't stop consuming it. There was one main character, yes, but really it was almost three, and I disliked all three of them. I did, however, have at least pity for the main one, The Girl On The Train. This is by design, of course. But I get the feeling like I should have had some compassion for everyone in the story, but generally all I could feel was a sickening sense of distrust and the desire for vengeance for most of them. There were a couple plot twists that resembled cliche's more than that of a wolf in sheep's clothing (see what I did there?), but it was easy to overlook when considering the overall structure seemed so chaotically real that inevitability was never an issue to retain within myself. I felt anger towards character for what they did. I felt anger for what was done to them. I felt, I screamed, and in the end I ended up yelling at each of the characters in this book my own frustrations to each of them. This may sound bad, but I look at it as a wonderful achievement.The author crafted a story and characters that were real enough to push me into anger towards things and people that don't exist, and for that I say 'bravo'.If I don't have an emotional response at all, then I don't care. All I could do was care about this book, these characters, their filth and their humanity, all 6+ of them, to a point where I couldn't stop reading until it was over.Great book. "
2104,Mike Sumner,"“Don’t expect me to be sane, I can’t be, not with you.” And perhaps I have already said too much using this quote from ‘The Girl On The Train’. The book you cannot put down. How often have you read that in a review? Well, this was it for me. The book I could not put down. I finished it last night at 11:45pm, almost in a daze. Diabolical plotting, Hitchcockian, suspenseful, full of trickery and malice and right up there with ‘Gone Girl’. This book is a real chiller and I cannot say anything about the plot without giving too much away. The fact that I read it over a period of 24 hours speaks volumes. I cannot remember the last time I read a book that I could not put down...."
2105,Isabella Lim,"A page turner and psychological thrillerThis book is such a page turner I plunged through it in 3 days. The plot grabs me from the beginning. A woman narrating her observations and thoughts sitting on a train. Why is she so obsessed about the people living along the train tracks? Why is she making up stories of them? What is her story? My thoughts of each character evolves through the story. As I uncovered more of their lives, the characters take on additional dimensions. At the same time, the plot leads you through twists and turns, trying to play detective and unlock the puzzle behind all this. I highly recommend this book. It will keep you intrigued and involved. "
2106,Ivy,"Original review on my blog here.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was everything a mystery/thriller should be and more. I thought that Hawkins’ writing style really enhanced the book and brought the characters to life. I think the alternating POVs really helped with the mystery and the intrigue of the book, keeping the reader guessing and at the edge of their seat. In terms of who the culprit was, for once I actually got it wrong and I love that. Usually, I can pick up on the plot twist but when I get it wrong, it’s the ultimate surprise an makes me love the book even more. The book was narrated in three different POVs: Rachel, Anna and Megan and throughout each perspective, we try to discover what really happened to Megan. Rachel rides the same train everyday and at a certain juncture on her train ride home, she gets glimpses of a couple’s life who live in the house next to her old one. Through these glimpses, Rachel creates stories about the couple living in the home to the point where she has completely dreamed up a romantic fantasy that she wishes she had. Until, one day, Rachel’s fantasy comes crashing down around her.I thought that each of the three narrations were distinct and the characters were distinguishable from one another. The best part about this is that you absolutely cannot trust each of these girls. They aren’t out to tell you the truth – they want to tell you their story, you know? Sometimes, telling your story means exaggerations, making things up on the fly and concealing the truth – and that is exactly what these three women do in each of their perspectives. And the way in which they are connected in each other lives is also quite delectable and juicy.It’s difficult to garner sympathy for characters who not only make terrible, terrible decisions, but it is because of these terrible decisions that makes you keep on reading. As I was reading, I couldn’t even begin to tell you all my frustrations with Rachel. She just kept making the worst decisions and it was just like, how can you possibly do this? Out of all three characters, though, I think I connected the most with Rachel – and that might be due to the fact that she had a career in PR before she spiralled out of control. I, also like Rachel, like to create stories about the people around me if I observe them on a regular basis.I thought the alternating perspective as well as the jumping timeline really enforced the thriller/mystery aspects of the story. Not only did we get both the past and present from these women, but we had an unsteady timeline that forced you to keep track of when things were happening. And, if you were like me, you found this difficult to keep up with because you basically consumed the thing as fast as you possibly could. This book was also great in showing that as much as people think they tell the truth, often times they hide bits and pieces in only to enhance their projection of themselves to others. Definitely a wonderful character study and watching each character develop was great.ALSO, the best part? The best part was that in trying to decipher who the culprit was I was completely and utterly wrong. You know I love that shit, right? Way to be mysterious, Hawkins."
2107,Sian Powell,"Wow! What an exciting read! If you like thrillers then this is a book for you. The story is told from the point of view of the three women involved and the author does a good job of getting inside their heads. None of the women are perfect, but I found them likeable, I cared what happened to them. Rachel seems to be on a path to self destruction when we meet her, when the disappearance of a girl she has watched from the train catches her attention and changes her life.There were echoes of ""Before I go to sleep"" because Rachel has some memory loss (due it alcohol) and it is what happens during one of her memory loss episodes that is key to the mystery of the missing Jess/Megan. I can also see why comparisons might be drawn to ""Gone Girl"" but I liked this better than gone girl. For me it is more straight forward than ""Gone Girl"" and I preferred the ending.All in all a good read!"
2108,Kris Chavis,"This was an enjoyable read! I don't usually like mysteries, but I read Gone Girl, and I liked it a lot, so when the buzz about The Girl On the Train started buzzing, I hopped on board! Ha! A lot of people say its predictable, but it wasn't at all predictable to me, but again, I don't read these types of books usually. The writing was very easy and smooth, it was interesting, and not as graphic as Gone Girl. I definitely recommend for some light reading! "
2109,Scribd,"There’s no way to talk about The Girl on the Train without comparing it to Gone Girl. Both enjoyed the kind of buzz that leads to weeks atop The New York Times bestseller list and big movie deals. Both center on unreliable female narrators who make questionable life choices. Both take you on a chilling ride through sick, suburban marriages gone horribly awry.Despite the similarities, The Girl on the Train is no copycat. It’s a well-written, cleverly crafted thriller. The titular girl is Rachel, an unemployed, alcoholic divorcee who enjoys living vicariously through the seemingly blissful “golden” couple she observes from her commuter train each day. Her illusions are suddenly shattered when the wife disappears, and Rachel witnesses an event that may be the key to solving a murder.Like Gone Girl, the story will make you question the seemingly perfect lives of others. Through the first person narrations of three poignantly rendered female characters, Hawkins reveals how events, interactions, and relationships take on differing meanings to different people, how perspective shapes our actions, and how there’s always much more to a person than meets the eye. Wildly addicting and ultimately unsettling, The Girl on the Train is the perfect solution to those Gone Girl withdrawals."
2110,Olwen,"Fabulously engaging read; couldn't put it down. Just when you think you've got it all solved in your head another clue is revealed. Apparently it might be made into a film, and if it does it will probably be a ripper!"
2111,Anne W. Sweeney,I don't read murder mysteriesBut I kept hearing about this book. I really liked it. A lot. I like that it came from the point of view of the victim and the characters all who may have killed her. The main characterRachel got on my nerves be she Was so weak. But as the book unfolds you see the chinks in other characters armour-and Rachel's weaknesses and issues are pale in comparison to others! Nobody is always what they seem. This kept me reading and guessing -close to the end I had pretty much figured it out. Looking back I wonder if. I should have gotten it earlier! That's fun reading. I was in suspense. Give it a read. You won't be disappointed 
2112,Chrisy,"The epitome of a mystery, love the way this author writes, fabulous book. I hope they make a movie. "
2113,Bridgette,"I'm speechless, that was a fantastic read! "
2114,Chantal Johnson,"Let me real, Paula Hawkins: I hated this book until maybe 75% through. I hated everyone in it. Every character have me a migraine. I wanted to smack each and every one of them. However, that just means you succeeded in writing complex, flawed, and EXTREMELY f*cked up characters. At the root of this book is a thrilling tale of how much we don't know the people in our lives. Also at the root of this book? Men are garbage (I knew this) and women can also be garbage. Humans can be garbage!!! But then there were twists and turns and a great novel that unfolded at the end. I can honestly see why people have this as a one star rating HAHA but I was won over in the end. From pages 300 until the end (not a lot of pages) she nailed the ending and made this reading journey worthwhile. But forreal, everyone was annoying and terrible but still turned out to be a great read???? BRAVO PAULA HAWKINS!"
2115,Vertrees,"Couldn't put it down. Much like 'Gone Girl'- keeps you guessing and the characters are a bit despicable. The main character is a raging alcoholic, so although she is clearly the character with the most information, you can't believe a word she says (or thinks). Fascinating story, well-written and had me guessing until the end. "
2116,Holly Borgen,I couldn't put it down!!!!!Outstanding novel which takes you on a journey you could never imagine where it might end. Excellent character depictions and storyline!!! I'm looking forward to reading another by this author immediately!!! Fantastic read!!!
2117,Garry,"This was actually a GoodLISTEN. I feel a little as if I am cheating when I post LISTENS on here, but I want to keep track of the books I ""consume"" so I will keep doing it.Listened to this during 16 hours of driving to and from Washington, DC this weekend. A PERFECT road trip book. And the three readers do -- for the most (98%) part - an excellent job. My one complaint -- when Megan quotes Kamal, she turns the volume of her voice way down and mumbles...actually ""mumbles"" is too kind a word for it. I get that is trying to deepen her voice and adopt a bit of an accent, but couldn't someone in the recording booth have said, ""Could you try something else, my dear? Kinda losing you in these passages."" I will not bore you with a full on review. Suffice to say -- a twisty, turning, keeps you guessing, thriller that is the perfect mix of suspense, lightness, and mystery for eight hours of interstate driving on a busy summer weekend. I am VERY interested in how this gets ""pulled off"" as a movie. I don't think I know the work of the director who is doing this (director of THE HELP) but I think the bloke who did MEMENTO would be well suited...but maybe too well-suited. "
2118,Fran Hudson,Wow!! Just wow read this book! 
2119,Hannah Ward,"WOW!! what a book, I was lucky enough to get this book as a birthday present and I couldn't wait to settle down with it as I have read so many reviews about it. I thoroughly enjoyed it and managed to read it in less than two days. I do love a psychological thriller and this one did not disappoint it had everything you would want from a thriller. There were a few complex issues which I think Paula Hawkins has portrayed extremely well. Even though the book is set out with three of the characters Rachel, Megan and Anna, it is easy to understand and I literally couldn't put the book down as I wanted to find out what was going to happen next. This is a book that will keep you guessing and there is a twist at the end that you won't of seen coming till it hits you. A must read for this year."
2120,Kim Kelly,"Amazing. I loved it. I also appreciate that the entire book is from the female perspective. However, I find it intriguing how much time these women devout to the desire for male attention. Their lives appear meaningless to them without the attention of some man. This book proved to me that you don't have to like the character of a novel to truly enjoy the plot. Great story."
2121,Rebecca Needes,"I raced through The Girl on the Train – an utterly compelling novel with one of the most infuriating female narrators I've come across.Rachel is an alcoholic, and her lack of control over herself and the events around her – her inability to stop and think clearly, her unreliable memory – infects the entire narrative with a queasiness and a sour sense of menace. She's at once sympathetic and maddening – but, unlike Maud in Elizabeth is Missing, Rachel is doing all this to herself. Or is she?When the woman who lives a few doors down from her ex-husband and his new wife goes missing – the woman Rachel sees as she passes on the train most mornings – Rachel knows she's seen something, and can't help inserting herself into the story. But is there something more to her obsession? And what really happened on that night that she can't remember.Switching between the stories of Rachel, missing Megan and mistress-turned wife Anna, the strands twist together and apart again, the truth remaining blurred – like the view from the train, like an alcoholic's fuzzy memories – until the very end. I'd convinced myself that everyone was the murderer at some point or another, but it's a mark of the strength of Hawkins's writing that I wanted for Rachel to sort herself out and be ok almost as much as I wanted to know who the murderer was. A great read."
2122,Nick Pageant,"Unreliable narration, steadily building tension, fantastic nail-biter of an ending. WOOT!"
2123,Maggie61,"What a thrilling read! This one kept me guessing on whodunit well into the book. The book is written in the viewpoints of three women, Megan, Anna and Rachel, and initially hops back and forth from the present, to about 6 months prior. It is mainly Rachel's story and I did find Rachel very unlikable for a good portion of the book. She was a sloppy drunk who lost her husband, lost her job though she took the train every day pretending she was going to work and lived in a room in the home of a college friend. Her ex Tom has remarried, to Anna, the woman he was seeing while they were married and they have a child. They lived in the same house that Rachel and Tom lived in and every day on the train, she passes their house. She cannot seek to let go of Tom, she goes to their house repeatedly and calls over and over, never letting the humiliation change her decisions. Soon she notices another couple several doors down and she obsessively watches them and names them. And then one day, the wife disappears. Rachel spends most of her days in an alcoholic daze so when she has flashbacks or memories, is that what they are? Did she imagine events in her mind or did they really happen? And how will she prove it? She had lied over and over to the police to the point that they just think she's a lying drunk. She finds herself, under false pretences, winding her way into the life of the missing woman's husband which doesn't help anyone's story. I found myself towards the end struggling not to cheat and read the ending. I couldn't wait to fly through it to the end. Anyone who wants a gripping thriller, this is it. And it'd make a fantastic movie."
2124,Sandra,"Check out this and many more reviews on my blog and follow me https://throwmeabook.wordpress.com/20...Rachel Watson, an unemployed and alcoholic thirty-something, rides the same commuter train every day, imagining lives for the people she observes from her train window. Along the tracks is her former house, the home she shared with her ex-husband Tom Watson, where he now lives with his current wife Anna and their daughter Evie. A few houses down live Jess and Jason (whose real names are Megan and Scott Hipwell), one of the couples Rachel has created the perfect fantasy life for. When Rachel discovers Megan has disappeared, she manages to insinuate herself into the ongoing investigation and befriend Scott. Rachel soon discovers that the beautiful and put-together Megan she created in her mind was far from that, hiding many ugly secrets, one secret in particular that could potentially destroy them all. After waiting almost three months on the holds list at my local library, I finally got my hands on a copy of The Girl on the Train, probably, if not definitely, one of the hottest and most popular reads of 2015. And what did I think of it…I LOVED IT! Damn you Paula Hawkins for writing such a thrilling novel! I was so engrossed in the story that my poor husband and children had to fend for themselves the two days it took me to rush through it!The Girl on the Train is a masterful psychological thriller that definitely does not skimp on thrills, with twists and misdirection at every turn, taunting the reader, imploring you to keep reading, hungrily turning the pages on this enthralling, maddening rushing train ride. Truth be told, every single one of the characters of The Girl on the Train is a horrible, hateful, petty and deceitful person, hiding their secrets and obsessions under perfectly created masks. Paula Hawkins has taken her immeasurable talents for writing and storytelling to create them, but instead of deterring the reader, her prose just pulls us in with every sentence read, and making us want, need more than anything to discover these characters ultimate outcome.Absolutely recommend to everyone. A movie adaptation of The Girl on the Train is already in the works, which isn’t at all surprising, so read it preferably before the movie comes out because well, I always enjoy reading the book before watching its movie adaptation.I give The Girl on the Train 4.5/5 stars. "
2125,Anisha Singh,"I finished reading The Girl on The Train by Paula Hawkins last night and wouldn’t stop thinking about it. I had been postponing reading the book because the mystery seemed so sacred. I was afraid that once I finish the book and the mystery is over I will be left with an empty hole in my heart. Well, that happened but it also left me with a good feeling of having read such an exalting suspense and thriller after such a long time. I am not a sucker for detective or crime fiction but lately I have found myself drawn into it. I have read the Cormoron Strike novels by Robert Galbraith aka J. K. Rowling and now this.The novels begins at a slower pace just like a train and once it grabs speed you can’t just deboard it. I didn’t realise when I got hooked onto the novel and I did an all-nighter to finish it. Now I am left with a raw feeling as if something that I had planned to go one way, has gone another way. While reading you might make a list of suspects, you might guess what may have happened but when the truth is revealed you will be blown away.The novel is written in first person and through the point of view of three different people (I am not disclosing the names). All the characters are sketched out beautifully. I felt that I knew the characters inside and out. Their insecurities, their fears, their weaknesses, everything has been dealt with and told to the reader.The narration style is very different, something I haven’t encountered in a long while. The stories sometimes run parallel and sometimes to and fro. One has to be careful with the dates to not get jumbled up. I kept going back to the dates because they are a vital part of the story. Paula Hawkins never strays in telling her story and you can not find a single loose end. There are different characters with different stories which all gradually merge into one.The diversity of characters is something I loved. At points they seem similar, similar to the point of fault but they all turn out to be very different. There’s an alcoholic, there’s a possessive husband, there’s a protective mother and there’s a directionless woman. They all come loaded with their own pasts and issues which play an important part in the story. Read full review here : https://thebrokeninkpot.wordpress.com..."
2126,Denisse,"Read for the 2015 Reading Challenge: #10 A mystery or thriller. I completely enjoyed this thriller. Every single page of it. Paula Hawkins pulls you slowly into her story, I didn’t even notice when I started to get so excited. I know the first chapters won’t be exactly good for everybody because they have a lot of background story, but it worked for me. An excellent thriller about how deep we think we know people, how easy it is to believe in them, and how scared it is to not being able to believe in yourself A must for anyone who enjoys the genre. *Expect a bunch of really twisted characters...really twisted.
“I feel like I’m part of this mystery, I’m connected. I am no longer just a girl on the train.”
Lo mejor que me he leído en lo que va del año, sin duda. Intento recordar cuando fue la última vez que me leí un thriller psicológico y no lo recuerdo. Creo que en Agosto o Septiembre! Y es mi genero favorito. NO.LO.CREOEmpezare diciendo que este libro me engancho desde la primera pagina. Que la escritura de la autora es muy intensa sin necesidad de sobredramatismo. Y que la historia en conjunto esta muy bien pensada.El libro empieza un poco lento, es cierto, pero no soso, hay una inmensa diferencia. Los primeros bastantitos capítulos son sobre los personajes, su pasado, su presente, sus sueños, su realidad. Pero esta contado de una forma tan ligera que nunca sientes el libro pesado. Realmente estas interesado en su vida.
“There’s nothing so painful, so corrosive, as suspicion.”
Para cuando empiezan a suceder todos los twists ya conoces o crees conocer tan bien a todo mundo, que te olvidas de todo lo demás y te metes de lleno en la historia. NO CONFÍES EN NADIE. EN NADIE. 
“if you can’t remember what you’ve done, your mind just fills in all the blanks and you think the worst possible things…”
El personaje principal es Rachel, y lo mejor de tenerla a ella como principal es que ni ella ni tú puedes estar segura de lo que ha visto. Es una mujer tan dañada por la vida y ella misma que duda de todo lo que pasa porque no puede creer en si misma, y eso va a darle un misterio muy padre a todo el libro. Megan y Anna son los otros personajes importantes, y a su manera las tres tienen todo un problema psicológico loquisimo. A nivel distinto, pero bastante notable mientras las lees, y para nada confiables. El ritmo del libro aumenta mientras avanza la historia pero nunca llega a un punto donde se sienta too much . El misterio se mantiene en perfectas condiciones y lo creepy llega de la manera menos esperada y mas inquietante de todas. Oh, lo fácil que es ver lo que queremos ver, y lo todavía mas fácil que es hacer que las demás personas vean lo que quieren ver. Creepy stuff. 
“By the end of the day, everyone is going to know where they stand.”
Altamente recomendado para cualquier persona que disfrute este genero, no pueden dejar pasar este libro.*rogando para que se haga una película y sea tan buena como Gone Girl lo fue*"
2127,A,"Absolutely brilliant book! Great characters, interesting and suspenseful plot and fast pacing. I loved it!If you hated Gone Girl like I did, you will like this. Characters are more multi-dimensional. Yes they are a mess but you can feel sorry for them too. Not like Gone Girl where you think those 2 evil people just deserve each other."
2128,Anne Ciccio,So good. Not as twisted as Gone Girl buy very suspenseful. Kept me on the edge of my seat till the end. A real page turner. Can't wait for the movie
2129,Paige Staudacher,"The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins is a cleverly plotted suspense thriller that I throughly enjoyed reading. This novel shadows some indomitably spirited characters that help pace this read from the beginning to the twisted end. The imagination that this author brings to this riveting novel at times is unnerving, as most will have a hard time putting this book down. If you enjoy nail-biting, spine-chilling pieces of works then this is an excellent book for you to choose."
2130,Lynda,I couldn't stop reading. Loved it!
2131,Tom Malinowski,"When Rachel takes the train, sometimes she can glimpse a couple outside at their house. She fantasizes about who they are, what they're like. When one day she sees something amiss, she becomes entwined into their lives and a whole mess of lies and deceit begin to unravel and multiply.Wow and whoa. I definitely felt influenced by the rave reviews to read this as it's been somewhat compared to 'Gone Girl.' That's not necessarily a bad thing. With shifting perspectives, the characters mainly unlikeable, I was still enthralled. "
2132,Vicki,"I just finished The Girl on the Train. Wow! Amazing book. This reminds me of Gone Girl. This is a psychological thriller that starts with Rachel riding the Train as she does each morning and evening. She watches the homes and people as she goes about her daily train rides. She imagines their lives as she believes they are. When the wife of one of the people she watches disappears, she remembers seeing the woman with a man other than her husband. Unfortunately she is considered unstable and an alcoholic. But what will happen when she starts putting herself in the midst of the entire investigation. Again highly recommended. I can see this being the next Gone Girl. 5 Stars definitely!!!!"
2133,Sarah Johnson,I've rarely read a book where I don't like any of the characters but really enjoyed the book. This is that book. 
2134,Shelia,"DifferentI have heard many comparisons to Gone Girl. I have to say that I disagree. I do not mean that as a out down at all, I loved reading Gone Girl, loved this book as well, but I find them to be two different styles of writing. It is a greatly written story, filled with twists and unexpected discoveries. I enjoyed reading it very much, and will most certainly read from this author again. If you are looking for something differently twisted and entertaining, read The Girl On The Train. "
2135,Bethany,"Holy crap, what a ride! Omg, this book was fantastic. Could not put it down! Please read it!"
2136,Michelle Young,"A surprise from the beginning to (almost) the very end, this best-selling, runaway novel’s appeal lies in its pace and in the deranged point-of-view of its main character. A woman who no one ever wants to become, Rachel is a lonely, unemployed, raging alcoholic, who can’t stop herself from stalking her ex-husband while fantasizing about the lives of others that she observes on a daily basis from the window of her train car. Reminiscent of Hitchcock’s ""Rear Window,"" the author uses a similar device to thicken the plot as Rachel witnesses a possible clue to a murder from her vantage point. A classic enabler, Rachel gets herself enmeshed in a murder case that entwines her own dark past with the present. This book—often compared to Flynn’s ""Gone Girl""—has a far more satisfying ending; I will never look at a corkscrew quite the same way again. Highly recommended. "
2137,Dena,Great book! I read this book within a week. It reminds me of Gone Girl. 
2138,Vicky,"~potential spoilers~Again, not my usual type of book, but I really enjoyed it. It was well-written, the characters were fascinating and complex, and the story perfectly twisted and constructed. There were a lot of similarities between ""The Girl on the Train"" and ""Gone Girl"", which I had just read, but ""The Girl on the Train"" was by far much better written and developed.One of my favorite parts of this book was the complexity of each of the characters. As the author uncovered the layers of the plot, I found myself loving each character as much as I hated them, which showed me how well formed they were. I also loved that the first half of the book was largely written as the diary of a woman on a train and slowly follows the main character to her home, through her quest, etc. In fact, I was on a train when I started the book and on a train when I finished it."
2139,Alejandra Garzón,"""La vida no es un párrafo y la muerte no es un paréntesis"" Una vez comencé a leer las primeras páginas supe que me iba a encantar, y cuando estaba en las últimas páginas me había enganchado con cada uno de los personajes que no quería continuar leyendo por miedo a que se acabará tan pronto, pero aun así la misma historia no me dejo otro remedio que seguir para no quedarme con esa angustia de saber que había pasado."
2140,Bernardo Géo,"This book was SO damn good. What I fear most about thriller novels is the fact that sometimes they can be so bloody slow until the ""reveal"" moment comes (my main problem with gone girl). But with The Girl on the Train, it was different. The story was so fast paced that I didn't even had the pleasure to the close the book, i kept on reading it! In other words, it was so freaking addicting. The plot-twist was a complete surprise to me, and Paula's writing style was speechless. "
2141,Wendy Hudson,"Everyone is comparing this to Gone Girl but honestly, the writing is far better. This is a lot faster paced, more twisted, and more depth is given to the characters. Paula did an amazing job for this being her debut. Am I the only one who thought that the red haired man was going to be Mac?"
2142,Ang,"Excellent!!!! Well written, great suspense. I'm looking forward to reading other books by Hawkins"
2143,Dennis Anthony,"Didn't someone once describe the television show, ""Seinfeld,"" as bad things happening to awful people? It could have been the subtitle for this book.Having said that, this book was a joy from start to finish. The story was well told and while the characters -- just about every single one -- were reprehensible in their own way, each of them was unique. Their behaviors -- within the framework of their odd world -- were logical and believable.A lot has been made of the unreliable narrator aspect of this book and it's there, but not in the way I would have expected. I read some people saying they saw the ending coming. Maybe I'm dense (I've been called worse) but I didn't. I had my suspicions eventually, but how the thing finally played out was surprising and masterful. No spoilers, but one word: corkscrew.Bouncing between narrators is always dangerous but Paula Hawkins is a skillful writer and pulls it off. I can't believe it's her first novel. Can't wait to read more from this exceptional talent."
2144,Jadrian Wooten,"I love the back and forth narratives between time/people. These are the types of books that keep me reading. Once you understand the relationship between the characters, it all flows smoothly."
2145,Rachel Powers,This book was fantastic. I couldn't put it down and it kept me guessing throughout the entire book. Definitely recommend. 
2146,Reagan Vance,I rank this one up there with Gone Girl! Super suspenseful and also a bit stressful. I loved it. 
2147,Ann,"dark sad and compellingNot only a good mystery but brilliant grasp on how we lie to ourselves, rationalize and cover the darker side of our human psyche. Stayed up till 4am to finish it. "
2148,Booksdigger S,Mind blowing twist in the end. A book that wold keep you awake late at night just wanting to know what is going to happen next. 
2149,Becca,"Well, well, well....talk about a mind trip. This one is a definite mind trip. I am still thinking...WHAT! Rachel is one messed up chick. I mean messed up. Then there is Megan and Anna. I think in their own way they are all pretty much messed up! They have some serious issues to work through.Rachel, sees something from the train on one of her commutes that leads to an exciting, and twisted turn of events. A girl goes missing. Rachel cannot let her ex go, and Anna wants to get rid of her husbands ex.Rachel cannot seem to move past loosing her husband. She becomes an alcoholic, and instead of letting her room mate know she lost her job, she rides the commuter train every day at the same time. She stalks her ex-husband and new wife relentlessly. She cannot seem to pull herself together. When she goes to the police with what she saw on the train, she is considered an unreliable witness because of her drinking.Megan, we find out is not the sweet wife she seems to be. Rachel has nick named her and her husband Scott ""Jess and Jason"". She watches them each morning on her commute to the city. She imagines what might be going on behind closed doors. Of course there is far more to Megan's story, than just drinking tea and visiting with her husband on the back porch.Anna, is Tom's new wife, and Tom, is Rachel's ex-husband that she cannot seem to move past. There is always some kind of drama that Tom is saving Rachel from, and Anna just wants her gone.The story gets very exciting when we come to realize that all three of these women have something in common that they don't even know.I was totally surprised by this ending. I don't know why I am always surprised but I am. I do have to say that there are so many ""bad"" guys that this could have ended three different ways, and all would have probably been just as good.When Rachel's memories start coming back to her, and things start coming together the book gets to a point where I could not put it down. It was so fantastic. This was exciting, twisted, and a little creepy. Makes me wonder who I am living next door to :). Everyone seems to live such ""normal"" lives in this book. Until their worlds begin to collide with each other.If you want a great, mess with your mind, exciting book to read, this one is right up there. It was so interesting to read. I love that it came from three different POV's. It made it that much more exciting to me. I loved seeing how it all came together. "
2150,Josh wolfe,"Good read. Not overly crazy twist but well written. Finished in a few days. Pretty hard to put down. I'm always looking for a finish to a book that leaves you in complete awe. On a scale of 1 to 10 and 10 being the most ludicrous ending its about a 7. A little disappointed but that's probably just me. Not gonna say what character it was but he or she was to farfetched for me. However this was a very well written and entertaining book. If you have ever blacked out from drinking and know certain things from that night or think you do or maybe have a feeling that you know something bad or good happened, this book takes you down that road. "
2151,Linda Harkins,"For sheer entertainment, this is an excellent read! What an intense and unpredictable story British journalist Paula Hawkins tells through the first-person accounts of Rachel, Megan, and Anna! Anyone commuting on trains may have made up stories of the lives of those dwelling in houses and apartments close to the tracks just as Rachel does. The author grabs the reader's attention as she explores such themes as loneliness and alcoholism, obsession, abuse, and isolation and holds it into the final pages. "
2152,Joseph Morgan,"Very, very well written story. It slowly builds to an excellent climax! I really enjoyed it."
2153,Monnie,"There's a darned good reason this book is on the New York Times Bestseller List: Simply put, it is totally, utterly one of the most engrossing books I've had the pleasure to read in a long while. It also was an Amazon Best Book of the Month for January 2015 - no surprise there, either - and add me to the list of those who will be happy to see this one get all the honors it deserves.To describe it as a psychological thriller probably really doesn't do it justice given the inner- and outer-lapping lives of the six main characters. Where does one begin and another one start? Are any of them real, or are they just figments of one (or more) of the others' imaginations? After all, the book begins with Rachel on a commuter train - the same one she takes every day - stopping at one point at a row of houses in one of which she almost always sees a couple (she's named them Jess and Jason) doing ""perfect couple"" things on their perfect little deck. Until one day they don't; Rachel witnesses a scene that shocks her into reality (her version of it, at least) and she's compelled to call the police. From the outset, the story is told through the eyes of three of the main characters: Rachel, who once lived in this same row of houses with what she thought was a loving husband but now is occupied by her ex-husband, his new wife and their baby; his current wife, Anna, and Megan - the ""Jess"" of Rachel's train-ride imagination.Then Megan turns up missing, and Rachel - who's more often drunk beyond the point of oblivion, has lost her job and is and still in love with her ex-husband - desperately tries to retrieve long-forgotten memories (if in fact they ever happened at all). The daily train ride quickly turns into a train wreck that's totally unavoidable, with readers being dragged along every mile of the way. And what a heck of a ride it is!Ever the grammar vigilante, I'm compelled to say that the substantial number of run-on sentences really bugged me, although I admit that once I got half a dozen chapters into this one I really didn't give a damn anymore. And I also noticed that a job interview Rachel's landlady had arranged with a friend was mentioned quickly and then - even though it was pretty clear Rachel got drunk again and didn't make it - never was heard of again. Given the landlady's disgust with her tenant's alcohol abuse, I'm pretty sure she'd have been livid when she found out Rachel had blown yet another opportunity to improve her life. But you know what? I'm still curious, but I really don't care about that, either. I leave you with this advice: If you have only one book to read this year, make it this one. Wow!"
2154,Morgan Grainger,"If you haven't read this book yet... You need to stop whatever you are reading or doing and start it!!! This book is super fast paced from page 1!! I don't think I have EVER been this addicted to a book in my life... I wanted to run to the restroom at work just to read the next chapter (but obviously I didn't). Is this the best book I have ever read? No of course not, it's not even close -- but I had to give it 5 stars just because I couldn't put it down! None of the three narrators are likable or can be trusted but that doesn't take away from the intensity of the story!! My only complaint is they could have added some more details to develop the storyline a little more- otherwise BRAVO!!! "
2155,Kim Hurd,"I really enjoyed this love crime mystery story. I was getting frustrated with the book and wanted to stop reading it because I was so confused with the characters, but something about this story kept me going back I couldn't wait to start reading it again because I wanted to know what was going on. This is one story that will keep your mind going excellent read.The ending was a shocker.."
2156,Irene Griffin,"Well done, this book was hard to put down. The characters were developed so well that anyone of them was suspect. "
2157,ireadnovels.wordpress.com,"Review by www.ireadnovels.wordpress.com It is unbelievable that this is Paula Hawkins first novel. What stands out about this clever story is how the author has told the story from all characters with an exceptional high impressive standard for suspense. I really think we are looking at one the new finest female thriller writers for the future. I absolutely adored every page. I would encourage any thriller fan to buy The Girl On The Train as it gives a good mix of characters each with a story to tell and not knowing who is telling the truth or lies. The story is about married Rachel who goes from being a drinker to being drunk that drove her husband away. Through black outs during her being drunk she can't remember if she said or have done terrible things. During her train ride to work she gazes out of the window when she starts to feel like she knows the people who live in one of the houses. Jess and Jason she calls them. One day on the train she something shocking ,now she has her chance to become involved in Jess and Jason's lives. Chilling things happen, with a gut punching ending."
2158,Amashi,"A gripping thriller that revolved around alcoholism, domestic abuse and adultery. Worth the read! "
2159,Courtney Stephenson,"At first I wasn't sure where this book was going and if I was going to get into it, but I stuck with it and boy am I glad I did. This book was a great read that I could not put down! "
2160,Jeanmarie Anaya,"WOW. This was some book. I'm tired of GONE GIRL comparisons, frankly. I found this to be a lot different, but the thrill and suspense is similar. I actually enjoyed it much more."
2161,Gina Garcia Downs,Just when I thought I knew what was going on BAM... Everything changes!Great book!
2162,Laura Marie,This book was so fast paced and kept me on edge throughout the entire thing!The characters were presented as being single minded to begin with and then all become multi faceted. I love how the author changes characters and perspectives throughout the story. This really keeps my mind reeling and second guessing everyone and everything!
2163,Becky,"A thrilling, edge of your seat read. Told from multiple perspectives this book reminded me a lot of Gone Girl. Rachel is a mess, an alcoholic who has lost her marriage, friends, and job. She sees the other woman living what was supposed to be her life every day from the commuter train window. But she also sees the secrets people keep and this sucks her into a twisted love triangle that almost ends her life. "
2164,Bettielee,"I'm torn how to rate this. If I feel a euphoria or a profound feeling, I rate it high. Upon finishing this I was just sad. I don't know if it is our narrator and her take on things or if the UK are assholes when it comes to alcoholics....but man, I felt bad reading this. It opened dark ugly places inside of me. It is so easy to make people dealing with addiction or mental illness, especially depression feel horrible about themselves and further perpetuate the illness/situation/addiction. Add to this that Rachel has gained weight, and the fat shaming, the idea that she is no longer a woman, no longer worthy of attention or love, is just really hard to read.I can see where some people had trouble with the style of the book and just in general getting past the bummerness (official term there). But the bummerness and the heavy feeling the author managed to get from me is, as far as I can tell, great writing. She really knows how to portray addiction/depression and the less-than-stellar reaction it elicits from people. It may have turned some readers off or made it hard to get into the book, but it was genuine and real.The crux of the story is that something happened to Rachel but she can't remember it thanks to a drunken binge. She wakes up with injuries, a feeling of dread and half-remembered images. something about fists, the taste of blood, a young man on the train who may have flirted with her or looked at her with disgust, she can't remember. Now there are three first person POV's (something I don't really like but it seems to be a new thing and I doubt we're going to get away from it at this stage) but Rachel felt like the main character, the one who is driving the story and the only one I had any sympathy for. Whatever happened to her happened on the same night that Megan went missing. Not only is Rachel an alcoholic but she has a slightly obsessive personality (the two often go hand in hand) and she can't get over her life with Tom, her ex-husband. As a result, she takes a train that goes by her old house twice a day on her way to and from London. Just a couple doors down from her old place, she sees a beautiful young woman and her studly husband. She has an active imagination and gives them names and occupations and becomes slightly obsessed. When she finds out the woman from the house, Megan, has disappeared, Rachel has the feeling that whatever happened to her that night might be connected.(there is a lot of anger and frank expression in this next paragraph) We also see things from Megan's point of view and Anna's - the woman (or homewrecker) who is now married to Tom, Rachel's ex-husband. I wanted to punch Anna in her homewrecking face. Things are utter shit for Rachel, that is obvious, and this bitch can't understand what her responsibility is in this situation. She has no sympathy for Rachel. She also moved into her house a couple days after she moved out. I mean come on. She is constantly feeling superior to Rachel, just yuck. Now Megan is where the Gone Girl comparisons come in. We see things from her pov as well and learn she is not the person Rachel has imagined. But how could she be? Megan's relationship with her husband, and the husband himself, are nothing like the fantasies Rachel has imagined. What I didn't like about Megan's POV is that is seems like a diary...but it's not. That becomes apparent but I can't tell you how or why. Sorry. Spoilers. She had a really sad past and engaged in a lot of crazy behavior but I began to like her more and more as time went on.The other part that was hard to read was how Rachel just kept digging herself deeper and deeper with lies and half truths as she gets involved in the Megan's case. First off, that bitch Anna told the cops she saw Rachel on the night of the disappearance, and that she is unstable and called them every night (yes, she calls Tom a lot, but not every night) and so Rachel is now raked over the coals by the cops about something that happened ages ago. She wants to tell them what she knows, but between the good cop and the bitchy cynical cop who smirks at her, she is labeled ""unstable"" and an unreliable witness. Even when she tells them that she saw Megan with another man from the train. But she doesn't stop there. She also reaches out to Scott, Megan's husband, believing that he ""deserves to know"". So now she is going to the same street where her ex-husband lives, who she is quasi-stalking, and involving herself in a missing persons case. She just looks pathetic, and the cops further pigeonhole her as a nutcase.The plot was very tight - my reading time (per my kindle) was about 5 hours - and it never felt like it dragged. I could not figure out who was to blame - did Rachel do something? Scott? The guy on the train? What's his deal? It was so well done. I do want to pat myself on the back a little because I did see a dark little cloud over the perpetrator, but I was still not sure of everything and was very surprised at a few twists and turns. I definitely recommend this. Sometimes, reading a difficult book tells you something about yourself and teaches you stuff, and maybe even increases your sympathy or compassion for different groups of people. Or makes you realize that if some bitch steals my husband and starts making babies with him and wants to gloat about it, she best hope I'm dead or in a vegetative state."
2165,Jigyasa Bajracharya,"I didn't read this book, I completely gulped it in one go. The characters are all so messed up. I liked the narrative but I was more interested in hearing more of Megan's side. I love how the story twists around the timeframe Rachel can't remember. I wouldn't say I was completely surprised, but it kept me guessing enough and besides I was way too interested in seeing the characters unfold. Best I can say is, I asked for a thriller and thrilled I was.Spoiler?I felt a little cheated by the blue dress though. I kept thinking of that possibility but then shrugged it off solely because of that only to have her change that detail in the end."
2166,Mrwundramgmail.com,"This book got me on the edge, I've never read a book so fast."
2167,Teresa Nikolic,"This book was brilliant from start to finish. It took a while to get used to going back and forward between the different characters telling their stories, but I was hooked right from the first page, the writing is brilliant and really captures your attention, I couldn't put it down, it took me just over a day to read it. The characters were totally believable and I got quite drawn into Rachel's daily train trips to and from London, almost felt like I was taking the journey myself. The ending was totally unexpected and I was shocked when I realised who was actually responsible for the events that happened throughout the book. This book is well worth the 5 stars I've given it. Definitely recommended, a fabulous read."
2168,Kerrie,"This story is told by three narrators who identify themselves at the beginning of a chapter by just saying their name. The producer of the audio version has replicated these narrators by using three readers with distinct voices. That means ""reading"" it as an audio novel is probably not the best strategy, particularly as the time frame zig zags, with some narrators playing ""catch up"", so the reader is really never sure when events occurred, in relation to each other. With an audio novel you don't have the opportunity that a hard copy gives you of being able to flip back a few pages to check on a date or who is speaking. I suspect that if I had been reading a hard copy I might even have been tempted to write dates down and group events around them.Add to that the fact that the principal narrator, Rachel, who is the ""girl on the train"", is an alcoholic and is frequently drunk. The police sum it up when they say that her evidence is unreliable. Rachel herself is the first to admit this because there are great holes in her memory. She has flashbacks in the form of dreams, and she is never sure whether they are things she has actually seen or whether it is her imagination at work. However as she begins to ""dry out"" bits of her memory returns. All she has to do is work out which memories to trust.Rachel has lost her job in London because she came back from lunch drunk, having insulted one of her firm's biggest clients. She has been keeping up the pretence of going to work on the train so her flatmate will not know that she has no income. She desperately wants to be accepted by people, and to overcome her feelings of rejection by her ex-husband. At night when she is drunk she tends to ring him in the middle of the night and even turns up at his house, where she also used to live, and frightens his new wife by taking their baby out of the bassinet. Just coincidentally their house is just a few doors down from the house where ""Jess and Jason"" live.And then she sees something from the train which changes all their lives forever.So it is a novel that really makes the reader work alongside Rachel at solving the mystery.A number of reviewers have remarked on what a remarkable accomplishment the novel is, and I tend to agree. I have to list it among my best reads for this year."
2169,Meg Litts,"I read a lot of books and articles for my professional work, so do not allow myself personal reads very often. In preparation for such indulgences, I vet titles with the same research strategies as in my professional work: NPR/MPR interviews with authors, NPR/MPR reviews of new works, the weekly NYTimes book review, and of corse, GoodReads. That is how I arrived at purchasing The Girl on the Train, and what a rewarding read it was! I could have devoured it in one sitting, had I the time, but instead enjoyed every morsel of this suspense novel in those stolen moments for a chapter or two. Ms. Hawkins brought her award-winning daytime drama writing to the page, often leaving us in suspense at the end of a chapter where what we supposed would happen, happened but with a twist that compelled us to read just one more chapter. As a debut novel for Ms. Hawkins, Girl on the Train not only demonstrates a finely-crafted plot but also holds promise that we might look forward to many more good reads from this author."
2170,Judy Sheluk,It's been a while since I picked up a book and read until I was bleary-eyed. Fast paced and intense. Loved it! 
2171,Christy,"Definitely reminiscent of Gone Girl in style and plot, but still very enjoyable. Author does a fabulous job with characterization and voice. I was able to predict the ending about two thirds of the way through, but I still wanted to read to find out if I was right. Def recommend!"
2172,Tristen Perry,"This book was amazing despite from several people not liking it, but everyone has their own opinion. Besides the point, I think this book was absolutely positively amazing and I praise Paula for doing such a great job for her first thriller. Also, I loved how it showed Rachel, Anna, and Megan's point of view. It kept me on my feet every page. Once you thought you knew who the killer was it turned out to be wrong. I encourage anyone who loves a good thriller to read this book. I really hope this becomes a movie so I can see the characters in action like they was in my head while I was reading this wonderful book."
2173,Machelle,Crazy. Train. That's what this is! Talk about making you constantly second guess what you THINK is going on. 
2174,Billye,I could not put this book down. It was a part mystery and crime novel. I usually read historical fiction or award winning fiction and I usually don't like to read crime and mysteries. But the character development was done so well and although the characters were badly flawed you could understand what made them that way except for Tom. I wanted to know more about his upbringing. I thought it was interesting that the story was told by the 3 women involved with Tom. This was really a book that intrigued me and although it was upsetting to read and I was tense reading it- I couldn't wait to continue reading it. I would highly recommend it as a good read. 
2175,Debbie Mann,"Wow, I loved this book! The character Rachel had me yelling a lot. I loved the book Gone Girl. This kind of reminds me of that but its even better!"
2176,Marcus,"I picked up this book because it was a Goodreads Best of 2015 selection. Goodreads was right. This book was fantastic.The Girl on the Train chronicles the events surrounding a Very Bad Thing, told through three alternating, unreliable narrators. The voices were so distinct and powerful that after a while I felt like I knew them well enough to tell when they were lying to me (intentionally or because of a skewed world view). Looking back after finishing the book, I realized I was usually right. These characters were so fleshed out that I could read their tics even without faces.The mystery aspect of it hit the perfect pace for me. I love it when I'm putting the clues together one or two pages before the characters do. It makes me feel clever to have figured it out, but not impatient waiting for them to catch up with me. Reading this book, especially toward the end, I kept thinking, ""Oh my gosh! I think X is Y! ... OH MY GOSH, X *IS* Y!""My single complaint with this book may be spoilery, so look away if you must. Even taking into account the unreliable narrators, one character seems to make a major personality shift toward the end of the book. Some of the things this character says and does practically cross into cartoonish, mustache-stroking villainy. Even so, by this point I was so deeply enamored with this book that I didn't care.This is a fun, engrossing read. Highly recommended."
2177,Alexis Diaz,Amazing thriller.. This book will make your mind and heart race! 
2178,YuliaPavlova,"Отличная книга! Я не разгадада злодея, до момента с телефоном)) думаю это не спойлер)) но на всякий случай скрою"
2179,Melissa Simons,"I'm so glad that I knew nothing about this novel when I started. Amazing thriller. Great pacing. If you liked _Gone Girl_, this novel is one to read this summer. "
2180,Juliet-Camille,"Excellent psychological thriller.Gritty, real, and raw portrayals of women."
2181,Debbie Belue,What a great book! Some compare to Gone Girl but only similarities are that main characters include a husband and ex wife and a missing woman. And the way each chapter is from a different character's perspective. Couldn't put it down! 
2182,Liza Ferguson,My favorite read so far this year! Loved it! Any fans of Gillian Flynn would also love this dark story.
2183,Greg,"Rachel is an unemployed, divorced, overweight, alcoholic who takes the commuter train to London and back daily. Along the way she watches the same people from her window daily, particularly a young couple that she has developed an elaborate fantasy about. She has named them and has an intricate, imagined story about their lives and who they are. To her, they are the ideal couple.One day, after a particularly heavy binge, she gets off the train at the stop near this young couple. She continues to drink and experiences a blackout. The next morning she awakes bloody, injured, and hung over. She soon learns that the woman she has been watching from the passenger train window has gone missing.What ensues is one part The Hangover (only horrific rather than comedic) and Gone Girl. I completely understand the comparisons to Gillian Flynn and Alfred Hitchcock. This is exactly that type of story, at least for the first half.I enjoyed this fresh-feeling mystery, and I especially liked the character Rachel with her struggles with alcoholism and her inability to remember events that she felt she had been part of."
2184,Manuel,"I hadn't read such an intense book, ever. This was a very well executed drama and it kept me on the edge of my seat on several occasions. I'd love to see this book turned into a movie. With the right writers, director and cast it could smash so much. Needless to say, I really loved the book."
2185,Rosie Alaska,"Such a good book, and the characters are so brutally, honestly, realistic. And it's incredibly written, and superbly structured. At first I was worried that the multiple narrators would get confusing, but it was done so well it was never a bother. All in all it's a really, really good book.... up until the end. I was completely enraptured by it up until the mystery was resolved and I lost interest. It got a bit slow and drawn out in the last chapter or so, which was ridiculous right next to the consistently captivating beginning. But still. So good.This is the level of brilliance I expected to find with Gone Girl, but didn't. I think The Girl on the Train is immeasurably better. Loved it. A Lot."
2186,Kristen,"I really enjoyed this book. It kept me guessing until the very last chapter. The characters were all a little ""off,"" but that's part of what kept it interesting. Not to mention, this is a mystery about a missing person, so everyone is a suspect! I read a lot of reviews that compared this book to Gone Girl. I honestly do not see the similarity at all. The only similarity was that there was a girl missing. At first, I thought that I wasn't going to get into the story, but within the first 2 or 3 chapters (each chapter takes only about 3 minutes to read), I was hooked! I finished this book within 2 days, which is VERY fast for me. I usually drag them out for a few weeks. This book was literally a page turner. I couldn't put it down! I had to know what happened! Overall, it was VERY enjoyable, and I highly recommend it!"
2187,Tamar Fowler,OMG. Amazing...
2188,Paola Andrea,"Wouuu!!! De los mejores libros que he leído, hubo un momento en el que pensé que cualquiera pudo estar involucrado en la muerte de Megan, incluso las chicas en la historia, aunque era obvio que era un crimen sexual, al final me sorprendió cómo se desarrollaron las cosas, aunque desde cierto punto ya era obvio quién había sido el asesino. Me gustó mucho la manera en que se escribieron los capítulos, aunque en muchas ocasiones me hubiera gustado tener un calendario conmigo para anotar los detalles importantes de la historia, ya que no seguían un hilo cronológico, y no quería perderme detalles valiosos para descifrar a los personajes.Amé también que Anna no era precisamente la protagonista cliché, hermosa e interesante, sino que se trataba de una mujer más ordinaria, era alcohólica, y de hecho, a la percepción de algunos personajes era gorda y fea -Cosa que no pasará en la adaptación para el cine, será Emily Bunt-.No me gustó mucho lo lento que transcurrían los primeros capítulos, fueron aburridos y no me enganchaban bastante con la historia, sin embargo, lo seguí leyendo porque sabía que tenía excelentes comentarios y que pronto saldrá la película -y es imposible que no vaya a verla- así que como siempre, preferí leerme el libro antes."
2189,Rosie Blythe,"The story begins slowly, innocuously. Rachel travels into London every day, and like many commuters, she passes her time on the train by looking out of the window. As the 8:04 to Euston trundles slowly past the houses which back onto the railway tracks, she gets a fleeting glimpse of their occupants. The train always stops at the same signal, and Rachel gets a perfect view of her favourite house. She can see the couple inside as they go about their everyday business, and in her boredom, she makes up stories about them and their sublimely happy relationship. She names them Jason and Jess, and they come to represent everything Rachel wants – everything she used to have. “They’re Tom and me, five years ago.”We discover that Rachel has become something akin to Bridget Jones – if Helen Fielding’s creation had taken a really dark turn. She drinks too much. She’s put on weight and finds that men regard her with a mixture of contempt and pity. She makes nuisance calls to her ex-husband – she’s not being malicious, she just misses her old life. It all started going wrong when she couldn’t get pregnant, and her husband had an affair – now the other woman is his new wife and they have an adorable baby daughter. It’s not surprising that Rachel drinks herself into oblivion as often as possible in her rented single room – and now her alcoholism is also destroying her professional life. Meanwhile, we have a change in narrator, with alternate flashback chapters from one year earlier, voiced by “Jess”, the woman living beside the railway tracks. In reality, her name is Megan and her life is far from the perfect idyll Rachel has imagined. Can her past confessions shed any light on the events of today? The story begins to deepen when Rachel spots “Jess” kissing another man; this evidence of trouble in paradise rocks her to the core, bringing back memories of her own ex-husband’s infidelity. Rachel knows how devastating affairs can be; should she somehow contact “Jason” (who is actually named Scott) and tip him off about his wife’s indiscretions? It’s all rather too close to home – quite literally, as Rachel’s old house is on the same street as Scott and Megan’s. Her ex-husband Tom has remained there, joined by his new wife Anna – who also contributes the odd chapter just so we can hear her side of the story.Rachel decides to return to her old stomping ground to suss out what’s going on with Scott and Megan – “I just want to see him. I want to see them... what harm can it do?” – but it all goes horribly wrong. She wakes up with the hangover from hell and no memory of what happened on that fateful night – but Megan is now missing. Can Rachel piece everything together, or will she walk blindly into danger?While many writers create effortlessly cool and sexy protagonists (no doubt with one eye on Angelina Jolie or Brad Pitt for the movie version) Paula Hawkins dares to make Rachel, well, not particularly likeable. She’s a busybody, and her desperate desire to be involved with the action results in her spinning a web of lies which tightens around her as she gets pulled deeper into the murkiness surrounding Megan’s disappearance. Often, thrillers lose credibility because the main characters have to be smart enough to solve crimes, yet just stupid enough to make the irrational decisions which will prolong the book (entering the dark alleyway with the stranger, hiding in a cupboard instead of calling the police etc.) Paula Hawkins cleverly sidesteps this; Rachel’s alcoholism provides a realistic reason for her to make unwise choices (such as drunkenly contacting people she shouldn’t), and leads to her becoming more and more isolated as people shut her out of their lives. Rachel may be a frustrating narrator, with her erratic behaviour and dramatic lapses in memory, but we sympathise with her. (While wishing she could get her act together and stop being so self-destructive.) The rest of the characters also have an admirable collection of flaws – Megan has a dark past, and her husband may not be such a strong and selfless protector, after all. Due to Rachel’s stalkerish tendencies and harassment, we might have felt sorry for our third narrator, Anna, but then she admits that she liked being the other woman and doesn’t care how it affected Rachel. In fact, all Anna cares about is protecting the secure little family unit she has created.The book has been described as “Alfred Hitchcock for a new generation,” and I agree; as well as a slow-burning creepiness, it has that classic Hitchcockian theme of knowing that the police aren’t going to listen and take you seriously, no matter how urgent your information, because they already have you down as crazy and delusional. I found the story perfectly paced, with new twists and turns coming from the most unexpected directions. If you’re a binge-reader who can finish a gripping novel in one breathless sitting, be warned: you’re likely to end up reading under the covers at 3 am, and jumping out of your skin every time a floorboard creaks.An extended version of this review originally appeared as a guest post at https://thebookselfblog.wordpress.com/"
2190,Sue ,"The Girl on the Train is a psychological thriller that will keep you turning the pages until the end. It is told by three main characters Rachel, who drinks excessively to get through her life; Megan, who Rachel sees daily as she rides the train and is not the person that Rachel thinks she is and Anna, the woman who is married to Rachel's ex-husband. The story is also told in different time periods which is initially a bit confusing but helps to give the back story of the characters. I initially wasn't going to read this book because of all the comparisons to a certain book from last year but I am so glad that I did. Once I started it, I couldn't put it down. It is well written and will keep you guessing almost to the end. A Great Read!"
2191,Evelyn,"Rachel likes to make up stories about the people she sees while riding the train to London every morning. But when her fantasies intersect with their real lives, things get out of control.Devilishly wicked suspense in the vein of Liane Moriarty or Nicci French. I found myself running so many different scenarios in my head about the possible outcome."
2192,Julie,"Great page-turner -- I literally read it in 24 hours. The use of different point of view, and not really trusting the protagonist really makes this a great book."
2193,Beth McCraw,"Wow, this was really good, but it really messes with your head! You don't know what to think of anyone, and nothing is quite what it seems!"
2194,Julia,"""...When I started I was excited and wanted to get through it as fast as I can. I loved the way of telling the story. I enjoy hearing different perspectives on stories, therefore Paula Hawkin's way of telling this mystical drama through three women's eyes was great to read..""Read my full review on my blog, just click here."
2195,Brett Jarvis,Fun dark read! Had a difficult time putting down. 
2196,Trisha,"4.5/5 stars for this gripping thriller! It seems as though everyone is comparing this book to Gone girl & I guess there are a few similarities but I liked this book more! It is more fast paced and edge of your seat reading and it kept me guessing all the way til the end! I had a few theories, none of them were right & I love it when a thriller keeps you guessing like that! In my opinion it is a must read!!"
2197,Heliea,"That was incredible!I started the book a bit reluctantly and without any further knowledge of plot or characters. And the first three or four chapters felt utterly depressing, really well written, but utterly depressing. I stopped reading after that, and picked up the book the next day. And I read the whole thing in a sitting. Because honestly, once you start, how are you gonna put it down until you figure out what the hell is going on?The different perspectives, the detective story that is told by a different voice and not the traditional detective one, everything was on point and I loved every second of it. I mean, it is a mystery plot after all, and as I have previously mentioned I have read a loooot of those. Which means that I figured out who the killer was way before the reader is supposed to (and at the end the who-did-it was exactly as I had played it in my head), which is what I like about Rowling's Rebus: the way in which she makes me not know what to expect. But anyway although I did see the bad person and the bad deed coming from a mile, the ending was astounding and unpredicted, and it played out succesfully enough for me to forget the predictable nature of the mystery and be happy that I decided to pick up this book in the first place. It's amazing in every single way."
2198,Nancy Ellis,"This is not a book you relax with! The buildup starts at the first page and doesn't let up until the last. The characters are completely insane and will attempt to drive you insane figuring out what, if anything, happened and how Rachel's vision from the train affects their lives. You're in for a treat when you pick up this book! "
2199,Quinny Snow,"Tek şey söyleyebilirim, kesinlikle HARİKAYDI. Kitabı çıkar çıkmaz alan bir sürü kişi oldu ve çoğu da beğenmediklerini söyledi. Kitabı ben almadım, bir arkadaşım ödünç verdi. Her ne kadar ilk çıktığı anda hunharca almak istesem de kendime yasak koyduğum için alamamıştım -"
2200,Marcia,Best book of 2015! It has been a long time since I have read a book that I had a hard time putting down. And after having to grudgingly putting it down it stayed in my thoughts. I am looking forward to reading more from this author. If you are a fan of Gone Girl...what are you waiting for!
2201,Hayden,WOW WOW WOW.I loved this book. Something about a bunch of terrible people being terrible that really gets me going.Review to come.
2202,Sarah Trumpinski,I couldn't put it down! 
2203,Sarah Weathersby,"The Girl on the Train has been compared by many as being similar to Gone Girl. I read Gone Girl over two years ago, and I still remember it as being a tightly-crafted novel. The memory is probably fresher because I saw the movie. (I liked Ben Affleck more in Argo.)But what makes the novels similar? They are both told by more than one voice, more than one Point of View. Usually we can trust the voice of the narrator, but in both of these we have an unreliable narrator or two or three. We have liars and alcoholics prone to blackout. In both we have some pathetic characters. (Can they get a life?)I liked The Girl on the Train more because there was more positive character development at least in the case of Rachel, the girl on the train. I found the character development of Amy in Gone Girl to be creepy. Not someone I would want to be in the same room with.I gave Gone Girl four stars because in spite of the well-crafted story, the ending was unsatisfying. I have to give Girl on the Train five stars for closure."
2204,Stacia Edgell,Holy WOW!!! This book was amazing!!! I couldn't put it down and now I'm sad it's over.
2205,Kristin Schuster Kenney,Read it in a day. Couldn't take the suspense ;)
2206,Kathy Schultz,"The book is definitely a thriller and was hard to put down. The story is told from three points of view: Rachel's ( the girl on the train), Anna's and Megan’s. Rachel rides the train to London each weekday. One of the stops is right by the house where she used to live. The house is occupied by her exhusband Tom and his new wife Anna. Just a few doors away Rachel observes a happy couple, obviously very much in love. In her imagination she builds a whole story about them and yearns for the time when she and Tom were happily married. Then the wife Megan is missing. Rachel has seen something shocking, but she can't quite remember what it was. She sometimes has blackouts due to her uncontrolled drinking Is there a way to recover her memory of the night Megan went missing?None of the people in this story were particularly likeable. Rachel is an alcoholic and annoyingly clingy; Anna is self-centered, egotistical and totally involved in her own world; and Megan lacks moral integrity and loyalty. However, as the story unfolds we begin to understand why two of these women behave the way they do and that nothing is the way it appears. We can look at other people's lives and think they have a perfect life, but life is not perfect. Everyone has flaws and struggles to find who they really are. Each deals with tragedy and disappointment differently."
2207,Lana Parmenter,"I loved the story, and the way the author made the reader think at different times that the killer was some one different. Great read!"
2208,Patricia Harris-button,"Poor Rachel. Her husband has left her for a younger, thinner, prettier, blonder woman. A drinking problem surfaces before the divorce, and spirals into true alcoholism, impacting all aspects of her life. She rents a room from an old friend, and loses her job. Even though she has nowhere to go, she gets on the train every morning and goes into London, so that her friend/landlord does not find out she is unemployed. She watches the world go by and fantasizes about the couples and families that live in the homes she passes each day. One couple in particular interests her. She sees them out on their terrace frequently. Obviously very much in love. Their home just down the street from where Rachel lived with her ex-husband, and where he now lives with his new wife and baby.One day, on her train ride into the city, there's a change, something very wrong, and Rachel is intent on finding out what happened.I enjoyed the book and found it very suspenseful and hard to put down. I didn't expect the ending."
2209,Sherreé,"This book started out a little slowly for me, but I'm glad I stuck with it because it became an edge-of-my-seat-can't-put-down-page-turner. If you want a mystery/thriller that is a little out of the ordinary, you won't be disappointed with this one."
2210,Kristin Hopper,"If you enjoyed Gillian Flynn's writing you will love this. Lots of other comments say that they are tired of hearing to novel compared to Gone Girl. Granted, there are some slight similarities, the point I want to get across about this novel is that the writing is really dark and out of left field, just like Gone Girl. I had absolutely no idea how the novel would end up until literally the last 10 pages or so. The novel is a quick moving story, lots of plot twists and a whole mess of misunderstandings and lies. I don't want to spoil anything so I'll just need everyone to trust me when I say READ THIS BOOK. Stop what you are doing, shirk work, stay in on Saturday night and fall deep into this book. You will not be disappointed."
2211,Jeannie Hudson,I liked this book very much and admired the masterful plotting of themystery. I could really get into the head of the heroine as she struggled through her issues. Good job!
2212,Jane Fenn,"It's not often that a book lives up to its publisher's hype, but this one certainly did! I found it hard to put my finger on why this felt quite 'different' to other crime fiction/thrillers. The story is told from the perspective of three different female characters - that's unusual. The women originally appear only very loosely linked, but as time progresses, we find their stories on a horrific collision path. It's essentially a crime story, but the police and the official investigations are only minor characters in the story. The plot twists are intriguing and, for me, unexpected. The female characters are very easy to relate to, and empathise with. Probably can't say more without spoilers, but it's highly compulsive reading. Strongly recommended!"
2213,Aman,"A great thriller, page turner, couldnt put it down."
2214,Jill S. Mongold,"Kept me guessing up until the end. ""Liked"" all the characters. Also liked the way the book was written in the voices of the 3 women. "
2215,Stephanie Bryant,This was a real page turner. I stayed up way too late and kept thinking about it even after the light was out.
2216,Darius,"Paula Hawkins's melancholy tell of what happens to the survivor’s of murder victims as they go on living in the aftermath of loss, with their own pathologies and pathos, shines as a hypnotic and nimble new comer in a genre burdened down with rigid rehashing of the procedural tropes in many mystery thrillers. The story starts with Rachel piecing her life back together after being fired from her job. She is living with her flat mate Cathy, pretending to still be employed by riding the train into town each day, and generally snooping in the lives of her neighbors, imagining their specifics and superimposing her wishes on couples in her local park.She’s a lonely, self-loathing alcoholic, approaching the hill’s bend who may or may not have murdered a familiar woman in a blackout fit of rage. She keeps reaching into the missing spaces in her memories for those lost hours in hopes of discovering just what happened to the pretty blonde reported by the local press as missing.Along the way Rachel makes more than her fair share of missteps like attracting police attention toward her as a potential suspect when she really meant to aid the investigation, to identifying the wrong man as the murderer, causing his life undue pain, and even becoming friends with the victim’s husband, which blows up in her face when he confronts her about her lies.The characterizations are spot on. Thirty-somethings, self-involved and reflecting on their experiences to find meaning in their identities and daily lives. Enter Rachel the character with the story’s biggest narrative perspective, filled with angst and despairing after being fired for an alcohol fueled emotional breakdown at work. She looks for meaning in the lives of others and hopes to find someone to love her chubby body and crows feet ridden face.Meagan, the hot blond that everyman wants and every woman wants to be, is in similar shape. Her beauty is better, but her loneliness and longing are equally as strong as Rachel’s. The beautiful thing about Hawkins writing is she portrays these ladies desperate situations with striking visceral-ness. Their thoughts, feelings and perspective lunge from the page and right into your mind as the pieces of a real experience, though virtually distributed through the medium of the novel. In short these ladies breathe and live on and off the page.I would find myself feeling like, “Poor pretty Meagan—so sad.” not knowing that I’d feel less connection to her after I learned what she’d done to motivate her potential murderer. The roles were reversed for Rachel the books protagonist. I thought her quite unappealing at first when I thought she was a depressed and aging alcoholic. But when I discovered that she had several psychological pathologies, I loved her the way I love traffic pile-ups across the median. Memories and how they fade over time is the biggest thematic concept discussed in the pages of The Girl On The Train. From Rachel’s pure blackout, to Meagan’s more nuanced memories of darker days locked within the vault of her lonely feelings we get a cobbled together view of the past life events that motivate the characters’ current actions. Rachel’s cognition issues come from her drunken blackouts that leave holes in her memories. Meagan and Scott, her husband are both driven by faulty memories, either romanticized through distance from the events that inspired them, or due to constant rehearsal that glosses over the truest features from the past, respectively.Loss and how we as people deal with it plays huge in the themes category as well. Rachel as the barren mother turned alcoholic tries to fill the void in her life by helping Scott find his missing piece—just who murdered his wife. But she had in turn lost her dream of being a mother when it was discovered her womb was barren. Scott lost his wife Meagan to the hands of an illusive murderer. Meagan, before dying had lost her way in life due to the deaths of two key people from her past and her resulting disillusionment that sees her seeking to fill that void by cheating on her husband to prove to herself that she is desirable/lovable to men. Rachel’s pathological lying and constant meddling are attributes I loath to see in people I know, but on a character as nuanced and just plain crazy as Rachel, they are the life and breath of this narrative, which plays in the—what-about-the-people-who-knew-the-victim, realm.And that is the fresh air that Hawkins brings to the genre. Every detective mystery I’ve read or even watched in movie theaters shows the detective’s perspective, or the victims—you know through flash backs. This one discusses what happens to those waiting to hear that the police have captured the slayer of their wife, neighbor, or the girl the protagonist obsessed over as they road the train to town. Rachel, as an OCD nightmare stalker/private investigator sizzles as an unexpected suspense novel star who is an unreliable narrator and gets as close as law enforcement would to solving the murder when using their tactics. The author mingles a bit of the lead character’s own paranoia and pathological nosiness into her sincere attempts at exposing the murderer—thereby exonerating herself from the memory gap she has of the night in question. How emotive, cerebral and delicate this thriller truly is. From wondering if Rachel is the blackout killer, to the red herring of Dr. Adbic as the wanted murder, and then back to wondering if Rachel has actually killed Meagan again, I totally bought the slight of hand that author, Hawkins does right before my very eyes. A novelist as skilled at misdirection as she, would definitely make a great up-close street magician. And that’s what the first half of this novel plays out as. A card trick of a tome that kept me wondering who-done-it, while all road lead to the sketchy protagonist in the genre specific trope of the detective did it, but doesn’t remember—this time the detective is a blackout drunk with self esteem issues and a histrionics complex to boot. Read this dazzling New York Times Best Seller and recommend it to all your friends. "
2217,Trishy Wishy,"Just finished, The Girl on The Train. If you have a hard time with multiple narrators, I recommend listening to the audio book. That being said:HO. LY. FUH-UHCK. I did not see that coming. It did all the things a fantastic novel should do for me: 1. Made me forget about my student loan debt. 2. Made it impossible to put down (in my case, since I was driving and listening to the audio book, press pause) 3. Left me with that empty feeling you get after you finish a book. Everyone *RAVED* about Gone Girl (*gags*). Bitches, please. This knocks Gone Girl out of the water (and has characters you love to hate, as opposed to Gone Girl, where I wanted to hold them all under until the bubbles stopped). It's as if the females from The Awakening, The Yellow Wallpaper, A Doll's House, and Gaslight all had a love child and instead of meeting her untimely end, grew some balls and stuck it to the man. Literally. While I will not give a way spoilers, I literally let out an, ""ATTA GIRL!"" and a fist pump when I heard the ending. (Other drivers saw and probably judged me.)Kimberly​, now you know what I thought. I FUCKING LOVED IT!"
2218,Amanda Lawford,wow. Just wow. I won't say anything more because any statement is a spoiler. Don't read reviews. Try to ignore the hype. Avoid reading the blurb if you can. Just read this fresh with no expectations and enjoy a good read
2219,Jhazmin,"Un libro realmente interesante que merece una oportunidad.Rachel es una mujer con muchos problemas pero, desde mi punto de vista, entendibles. Su ex marido no ha sido la persona más sincera del mundo, ni qué decir de la nueva esposa, la cual era la amante y, la verdad, creo que está más loca que Rachel.Debo confesar que no vi venir ese cambio de personaje (o culpable), imaginé que la culpa era de otro hasta que Hawkins decidió dar un giro y me cambió el chip.Me gusta la descripción de los personajes, muy entendible la personalidad de cada uno de ellos, además, todos son necesarios para llegar a la conclusión de la historia.En fin, la historia me impactó, muy entretenido. En partes me hizo recordar a Gone Girl y a la saga de Millennium (Los hombres que no amaban a las mujeres), y creo que por eso me gustó mucho; ya que este último es de mis libros favoritos de siempre.Definitivamente, una buena lectura."
2220,Romi,This story was really vivacious and had some nice plottwists in it. There will be a review on it tomorrow on le blog!!
2221,Kathy Schulte,Loved every single page of this book. Terrific. 
2222,Madeline B. ,Quick read. A little over halfway was when I could not put it down! It kept me on my toes and I captured all sorts of emotions for me! 
2223,Nicigirl85,"Titel: Am Rande der Gleise...Irgendwie war das Buch dauernd präsent und je mehr ich darüber hörte, desto neugieriger wurde ich, weshalb ich es dann auch unbedingt lesen musste. Und meine recht hohen Erwartungen wurden übertroffen.Rachel fährt jeden Tag mit dem Zug zur Arbeit. Jeden Tag hält er an einer ganz bestimmten Stelle und wartet auf Weiterfahrt. An genau dieser Stelle beobachtet sie ein Pärchen, das so glücklich scheint wie sie gerne wäre. Doch sind diese beiden Menschen wirklich so glücklich?Die Handlung wird uns aus der Ich- Perspektive näher gebracht, jedoch nehmen diese Erzählperspektive drei unterschiedliche Frauen ein. Den Großteil erleben wir gemeinsam mit Rachel, aber auch Megan und Anna kommen zu Wort.Das Besondere an dem Roman ist wohl, dass die ganze Zeit unterschwellig Spannung vorhanden ist, aber eben sehr gemächlich und im Hintergrund.Das Hauptaugenmerk liegt hierbei auf Rachel, die ihr Leben leider so gar nicht mehr im Griff hat. Sie trinkt seit ihrer Scheidung und versucht ihre Probleme zu verstecken. Man bekommt durch sie ein genaues Bild von einem alkoholabhängigen Menschen, was ich als immens spannend empfand.Durch die gewählte Erzählperspektive erfahren wir sehr viel über die recht unterschiedlichen Frauen, die doch mehr gemeinsam haben als man auf den ersten Blick erkennt.Je mehr man als Leser dem Geheimnis näher kommt, desto süchtiger wird man nach der Schreibe der Autorin.Frau Hawkins hat einen sehr ernüchternden Erzählstil, aber gerade das lässt Rachel und Co so authentisch wirken.Das Ende hat mich so dermaßen überrumpelt, dass ich auf den letzten Seiten mehrfach schlucken musste und den Mund beim Lesen kaum noch zu bekam.Für mich zu Recht ein Buch, das in aller Munde ist. Wer es noch nicht gelesen hat, der sollte sich fix auf Reisen begeben mit Rachel und Co und lernen, dass nichts ist wie es auf den ersten Blick erscheint.Fazit: Überraschend spannend und absolut unvorhersehbar. Ich kann nur eine klare Leseempfehlung aussprechen."
2224,Misty,"What a great book! From the beginning you feel for the main character, Rachel, which leads to sorrow, disgust, and ""what was she thinking?!"" moments. As the rest of the characters (which are not in any place to cast the first stone) are introduced and as you follow their stories, you are constantly trying to figure out how their stories all tie together in the end. I thought I had it figured out, but slowly those ideas where chipped away until the realization of the truth caught up with me."
2225,Jennifer Reynolds,It was awesome. Loved every page but impossible to put down! 
2226,Gordon Mcghie,"I am very much against spoilers so I cannot reveal too much about the various twists in the plot of The Girl on the Train but I can assure you that there are twists a-plenty. The Girl on the Train is a gripping read – you must avoid spoilers, you must read it as soon as you can and you must hope that someone makes it into film so that you can tell them you read the book first and that it was incredible.Extract from my full review which appears at http://grabthisbook.net/?p=300"
2227,Wesley Higaki,"The Girl on a Train is a murder mystery (and perhaps a psychological thriller) about an alcoholic woman who suspects foul play between a couple she spies while riding on a train. The chapters alternate between three different points of view: Rachel, the woman on the train; Anna, the new wife of Rachel’s ex; and Megan, the woman Rachel sees from the train. The alternating POVs helps build the suspense throughout the book but I occasionally was confused by who “I” and “she” were in the narrative. This confusion was compounded by the fact that the author purposely made those terms ambiguous to increase the suspense.The character and setting descriptions are outstanding. The sometimes long narratives helped build the tension and heightened the sense of impending danger. Rachel is an alcoholic who just can’t stay sober. Consequently, she is an unreliable witness and she makes sometimes incredibly bad choices. The bad choices border on the unbelievable which is the fine line fiction authors must walk in order to write compelling stories. Rachel reminds me of Whip Whitfield, the alcoholic pilot, played by Denzel Washington, in the movie, Flight. Rachel and Whip can’t help themselves - their addictions to alcohol are just too strong and they just keep on drinking to the detriment of their well-being and survival."
2228,Teresa Pugh,"Have you ever found yourself passing by the same houses while traveling to and from a regular destination? Have you ever wondered who lived there, what they do and what happens beyond those curtained windows? Doubtless you would give it much thought once you passed by, but... what if you took that curiosity further?? Paula Hawkins' debut novel, The Girl on the Train, takes you down that rabbit hole.  It's filled with perfect combination of intrigue, dysfunction, deception, desperation, and just the right amount of blood from of unknown origin.  TGOTT was a novel I couldn't put down and hampered my ability to get forty winks.  If you're looking for that rare book that keeps you wanting more, I highly recommend that you get your hands on a copy of, The Girl on the Train."
2229,Kerin,Blinded by Love and LiesWhat an excellent read. This book takes you on a ride of your life and at the end of this book it leave you speechless because you never saw it coming. You never know what people are capable of doing when their backs against the wall. 
2230,Sallie,"Loved this thriller. I didn't see what was coming until the very end, I guess that's what makes it a quick page turner. None of the characters have redeeming qualities which made it hard to want to root for them, but I still wanted to know the truth so I stuck with their obnoxious characteristics. It felt like the perfect case of he said she said, which after a while I do admit I wanted he and she to both shut the heck up, but I think Hawkins employed this method to keep the plot under wraps long as possible also dragging the reader along with just enough tidbits to keep us interested."
2231,Kendra,This was so exciting the whole way through; I didn't want to put the book down! I enjoyed creating stories in my head for each character and why/how he/she could have done it.
2232,Carrie,"This is an intriguing rear window type of tale. As told from an unreliable narrator on a train. I felt it was a little slow in the middle. But definitely picked up and surprised me. Now I know why ""everyone"" has read it"
2233,Mainlinebooker,"Ok..so does the fact that I set my alarm this am to finish the book say anything? This book will definitely appeal to fans of Gone Girl.Not as deranged or dramatic but a slow burn that sneaks up on you . The story is set in Britain where the alcoholic girl on the train, Rachel, witnesses something which she thinks is a clue to a woman's disappearance. However, wrapped and twisted around this is her ex- husband,his new wife, and the missing girl's husband. It is told from the point of view of these three women,with Rachel being the dominant force. The characters are well drawn ,with the author handling the transitions between narrators' superbly. With excruciating tension, this is THE book to read.."
2234,Carmon   Simon,"I read this book today. From beginning to end I could not put it down! I highly recommend it if you want a suspenseful read!although I predicted the main plot halfway through, it still kept me guessing at a majority of the time. "
2235,Viktoriia Lastovets,"""Just what goes on in the houses you pass by every day?"" -- PublisherМрачноватая, местами нудновата, но интерееесная :-).Вцелом, отзыв положительный. На протяжении всей книги сохраняется интрига, хочется узнать, чем все это закончится и кто же виноват.К тому же, очень классно описаны мысли и рассуждения главной героини. Мнение о ней меняется постоянно. Но в конце-концов, становится понятным ее линия поведения.Книга, которая оставляет за собой какой-то шлейф мыслей и рассуждений о нашей жизни, о психологии людей, об их поступках.Короче, рекомендую :-)"
2236,Lorraine,Loved it! I thought it was a great book!
2237,Scarlet,"Oh boy! They hype is legit, y'all! So so good. I loved every minute of this book and yes, it's perfect for fans of GONE GIRL. I had no idea who had done what until the very very end and I loved the writing style of different narrators and time jumps. It really kept me wondering. At times, I had to set it aside because it was so grim/frustrating/dark, but then I snatched it back up because I just had to keep reading! Highly recommend. "
2238,Elisabeth Hosmer,"Wow. Just wow. I purchased this book after my little sister said she wanted to read it and I am so glad I did. I raced through this book and stayed up way past my bedtime to finish the last few chapters because I had to know what happened. The Girl on the Train is told from the perspective of three female characters: Rachel, whose life is in shambles and who rides the commuter train day after day past the town she once lived in; Meghan, who currently lives in Rachel's old town, in a house down the street from Rachel's old house; and Anna, who currently resides in Rachel's old residence. The story centers around a murder and discovering who did it becomes so twisty that you are guessing up until the end.5 big snaps for me!"
2239,Jeanette Michalets,"This novel is a real page turner. It's a complicated character study/mystery that reminded me a bit of ""Gone Girl"" in mood and tone.I seldom read mysteries, so I found this novel refreshing. I won't say much about the plot except that it involves three young women whose lives are intertwined. The primary narrator is an unreliable alcoholic young woman, Rachel, who rides a commuter train from the burbs to London every day. She fantasizes about a young couple whom she observes in a voyeuristic way from the train window on a nearly daily basis. Soon enough, the fantasy woman is reported missing on the same evening that Rachel was wandering the area in a drunken stupor, unable to recall what happened that evening as she has suffered one of her frequent black-outs after binge drinking. Suffice it to say that the plot involves her ex-husband and his new young wife and baby and the volatile husband of the missing woman. The novel kept me guessing until I had reached the ""70 % read point"" on my Kindle. I really was uncertain as to who the murderer was, but began to figure it out at this point.I found the book to be nearly flawless in structure and to be well written."
2240,Marleene,Good reading - good writing. I was into this book from the very beginning and all the way through. I would definitely read her next book if she were to write another.
2241,Markie,An awesome read!!!
2242,Jessica *The Lovely Books*,"I'm so sad that this book is over. I loved every minute of it. I think the readers were excellent in bringing the story to life. I really felt as if I were watching a movie of some sort. We follow three different women from past and present; Rachel, Anna, and Meg. All three of these women are connected in some way or another. This is mainly Rachel's story though and her character drew me in from the very beginning. See, Rachel is a drunk; an alcoholic. She's also clinging to her ex-husband and his new family that he had left her for when it was clear that Rachel was unstable. Throughout the book we are told that Rachel has witnessed something terrible but she doesn't remember anything because she was so shit-faced drunk. It's pretty sad. When Meg turns up missing on the night that Rachel blacked out, everything is all down hill from there. Every single character seems guilty and you don't know who to trust. That was the beauty of it until the very end. And your left thinking well duh, how did I not guess?! If you're looking for a thrill and mystery, look no further!"
2243,Karen Rock,"A gripping suspense from an unreliable narrator that keeps you guessing from cover to cover. Hawkins did a masterful job at keeping this story fast-paced and the mood dark and ominous. I love to figure out the ending and while I had it pegged about 2/3rds of the way through, there was still enough suspense to figure out how it happened and why to more than hold my attention. I especially liked the variety of female viewpoints from the narrator to the ex-wife and the dead woman. If you liked Gone Girl, this is the book for you! "
2244,Sue,"So far, my favorite book of 2015."
2245,James Sorensen,"Paula Hawkins is a new voice to the ""Psychological Thriller"" genre, and she jumps in with bang. ""The Girl on the Train"" revolves around the narration of three women and the three men they are involved with. The story is told by the three female characters.Rachel Watson is a falling down drunk alcoholic. Her alcoholism, brought on by depression due to her inability to conceive a baby, has led to the loss of her job and the dissolution of her marriage. She has a place to live, due to the kindness of a friend, but she travels back and forth, daily, on the train from Ashbury to Euston on the outskirts of London, pretending to look for work. Each day she must travel past the home that she once shared with Tom, her ex-husband. A home Tom now shares with the woman he married after his divorce from Rachel. The woman with whom he carried on an affair. A woman, Anne, with which he now has a child.A few houses down from where she once lived she daily observes the lives of the two people that now reside there. These two people, whom she has named Jess and Jason, are living the life she wishes Tom and she had lived. All's well until Rachel witnesses an event that will shatter their perfect life together.Megan and Scott Hipwell are the real names of Jess and Jason, and Megan is missing. The police will suspect Scott is responsible. Rachel must tell someone about what she has seen in order to protect Scott. But will anyone believe an alcoholic. Rachel has her own secret. She was in Witney, the town where Tom and Anne, Scott and Megan live, on the night Megan disappeared. However, she can't remember what happened because she was falling down drunk and suffers from black outs. The only memory she has is of Tom trying to help her that night, right before Anne, his wife, gets into their car and they drive away. Hawkins grips the read with a story that builds in tension as Rachel tries to overcome her addiction to alcohol in order to remember what happened the night Megan goes missing. By interjecting herself into the police investigation she opens old wounds and is the cause of new ones. The suspense deepens as Rachel bit by bit regains pieces of her memory of that fateful night.Paula Hawkins, whom some are comparing to Gillian Flynn (Gone Girl), slowly builds up the tension until the mystery of Megan's disappearance comes to an explosive and unexpected end. Ms. Hawkins has the potential to become a bright new star in the literary firmament. The characters are well developed and the story pulls the reader along on a fantastic (Train) ride to a shock filled ending. This is a dark story with characters that are not well liked, but like voyeurs, the reader will want to look through the windows of their lives. A highly recommended read!"
2246,Laura Handleton,"If you like unreliable narrators this book is for you! Nearly every character in this book is unstable in some way, especially Rachel who (to me at least) was the ""primary"" narrator over the other two women. She constantly romanticizes some characters despite evidence that they are guilty, while becoming paranoid and suspicious of others who don't deserve it. Often it is only after an incident is described by all three narrators that a full picture begins to form. I can see how this might make the book unappealing for some because every character is so messed up that there's no one to ""root for,"" but I really liked having such a twisted narrative.Some reviews describe this book as ""fast-paced."" Most of it is, but I thought several of Rachel's chapters were paced very slowly compared to the rest of the book. This isn't necessarily a bad thing--it gives an insight into Rachel's life as an alcoholic and her frustrating search for the truth. It would have lessened her character to skip her struggles with drinking or parts of the story when she feels she has exhausted her leads and doesn't know how to move forward, but it did add some parts of the book that were slightly difficult to get through.The Girl on the Train is often compared to Gone Girl. There are some similarities, and I think fans of Gone Girl will like this book, but it is by no means a rip off or copy cat. In Gone Girl, Nick is at the center of the investigation, so much of the plot focuses on the police investigation, the media portrayal of the case, etc. This is only briefly touched on in The Girl on the Train since the narrators have minimal involvement with the official investigation despite being so entangled in the incident. It is more about their personal struggle to understand not just the circumstances around the crime but, more importantly, the other very inconsistent and unreliable players in the events of the night of the crime.The ending was very dramatic and ended quite suddenly, leaving me with a few unanswered questions: (view spoiler)[Abdic and Scott both were disregarded at the end when the true killer began to emerge. What was Abdic's motive for revealing Megan's past? Is that even legal? Why did Scott hide the fact that he knew about Megan's infidelity? Presumably he thought it would give the police a motive for him to kill Megan, but later when Rachel told him about Abdic he acted thankful to her for giving the police another suspect to consider.  (hide spoiler)] Overall, I loved watching the characters unravel as they got closer and closer to the end."
2247,Zibby,"What. A. Ride. I love being catapulted into a book. The Girl on the Train lived up to expectations-- and then some. Hawkins uniquely oriented you to time and place and characters... and then subtlety encouraged you further. Great character unfolding: Empathy. Vision. Intrigue. There were so many twists along this track, but it was perfectly orchestrated so that wasn't confusing- just surprising and suspenseful. Cool cool read. "
2248,Mandy,"I loved the book. I went into it knowing nothing about it and with no expectations. Each character is a complete effed up mess in their own way, but I didn't find them all unlikeable. I could relate to the feeling of pity experienced by Rachel and the feeling of being left with nothing. I didn't see the plot twist coming but then again I wasn't looking for anything, I just took whatever twists and turns as they came, and thoroughly enjoyed the ride..."
2249,Ginger Smith,Great read!
2250,Jeroen,Uiteindelijk toch wel een mooi boek.
2251,Bobbi May,"The Girl on the Train was a great, fast read. It hit a little too close to home having lived with a sociopath myself. It dug into some painful memories which I didn't enjoy but the book itself was VERY good. Sociopaths walk among us and not all kill but MOST are destructive with the people's lives with which they interact. They figure out early on how to manipulate because they don't live with consciouses to make them feel guilty. They lie and cheat to get their way. I felt much sympathy with the characters of this novel and know there are many people in real life who have lived, living or will live with these masterminds of destruction. Great read, Paula Hawkins!"
2252,Jonathan,this book will hook you and will never ever let you go. recommended for inflight reading.
2253,Martha Newman,"Over the years, I have discovered that best selling books are usually best sellers for a reason and this book is no exception to the rule. The book features a fairly unpleasant protagonist, Rachel--a whining, self-indulgent alcoholic and builds very slowly, but the mystery builds to a dramatic ending. Here is the Amazon review: ""An Amazon Best Book of the Month, January 2015: Intersecting, overlapping, not-quite-what-they-seem lives. Jealousies and betrayals and wounded hearts. A haunting unease that clutches and won’t let go. All this and more helps propel Paula Hawkins’s addictive debut into a new stratum of the psychological thriller genre. At times, I couldn’t help but think: Hitchcockian. From the opening line, the reader knows what they’re in for: “She’s buried beneath a silver birch tree, down towards the old train tracks…” But Hawkins teases out the mystery with a veteran’s finesse. The “girl on the train” is Rachel, who commutes into London and back each day, rolling past the backyard of a happy-looking couple she names Jess and Jason. Then one day Rachel sees “Jess” kissing another man. The day after that, Jess goes missing. The story is told from three character’s not-to-be-trusted perspectives: Rachel, who mourns the loss of her former life with the help of canned gin and tonics; Megan (aka Jess); and Anna, Rachel’s ex-husband’s wife, who happens to be Jess/Megan’s neighbor. Rachel’s voyeuristic yearning for the seemingly idyllic life of Jess and Jason lures her closer and closer to the investigation into Jess/Megan’s disappearance, and closer to a deeper understanding of who she really is. And who she isn’t. This is a book to be devoured. -Neal Thompson"
2254,Danielle Gonzalez,"As a girl who takes the train into work myself, I was compelled to read this. Rachel takes the commuter train into London every day, and while riding stares out the window at a row of houses where she used to live. She sees a husband and wife and fantasizes about how perfect their life is. She is wishing that was her own life. Rachel used to live a few doors down happily married. Now divorced she is a broken woman whose life is spiralling out of control. One day she sees something that changes everything and makes her realise the couple's perfect life is not so perfect. The story is told from the perspective of Rachel, her husband's new wife, and the woman she watched from the window of the train. This is a hard book to put down. Rachel is a vulnerable woman who wants to be better than she is, but continues to let her problem with alcohol drag her back down. This is a psychological thriller that will take you on a ride. I enjoyed the book to the very end."
2255,Mike,"Nice who-dun-it, kept me guessing to the climax, even with the nudges. The saga of Rachel, Megs, Scott, Tom, Anna, the red haired man, Riley, and the doctor. I've already made sure it's available for my wife and my mother to read. (No, they are not one and the same)"
2256,Claire Riley,"Review to come, but... OHMYGOD!!!"
2257,AuntP,"This book was amazing! I'm so glad I read it. I wasn't so sure about it at the beginning. I wasn't identifying with any of the characters but found them very interesting. The interest and suspense grew stronger and stronger. It was quite beneficial and enjoyable being in the heads of various characters. I'm satisfied with the ending. Well done, Paula Hawkins! I'm looking forward to seeing what they've do with the movie version of this."
2258,Marielle,"This book is truly a masterpiece. It's really well written, psychological and twisty. I really couldn't put the book down in the end, because it just kept getting more and more interesting..."
2259,Bryana,5 stars! My favorite book of this year so far. Definitely not what I was expecting but in a good way!
2260,Cathy Kwon,Riveting story; great thrillerI couldn't put this book down! Read it on my first day of vacation all in one day. Excellent read
2261,Sandra Levine,"I couldn't put it down, once I got past the beginning. Truly unpredictable."
2262,Kayla,Everyone in this book is crazy in some way 
2263,Susan Wall,"The comparisons to ""Gone Girl"" are definitely on target. In fact, I liked this one even more. You felt connected with each of the women."
2264,Sundos,"من الكتب التي تقول في نفسك عنها: شكرًا للأقدار التي قادتني إليها. بولا هوكينز ذكية، وفتاة القطار رواية يجب أن تُقرأ ! ترجمة الحارث النبهان أكثر من مجرد رائعة. ""صفارة سيارة شرطة، صبايا تصحن وتضحكن، وموسيقى من سيارة عابرة. حياة طبيعية عادية. أما هنا، فإن العالم ينتهي."""
2265,Laura Crosse,"Phew... Like seriously phew....This was a mile a minute book. You know when you hear a review saying it was unputdownable but in reality its totally not. This is. I literally left my 3 year old in his pjs till noon so I could finish this book. I was also in my pjs but its okay I put the fancy 'Duvet Day' label on it and suddenly it's acceptable again. Anyway as I was saying this was such an exciting book! It was such an original plot but once you start reading it you wonder why didn't anyone think of this storyline before. Who hasn't sat in a train or a bus and looked out the window at a house or business and spied on the people moving around within? Humans are naturally curious and I am not an exception to the rule. I love people watching and wondering where that woman is headed and what that man does for a living. Don't we all do this to a certain extent? The book centers around Rachel, a woman who is going through a hard stage in her life. She is not instantly likeable which isn't shocking as most drunks aren't all that appealing to the majority of people. However you do start to feel for her situation and wonder is she truly completely to blame for the predicament she finds herself in. Can other people or situations drive a person to drink or to have mental health issues? Maybe. Maybe definitely. I don't want to give away too much of the plotline but this book is well worth buying and I'd recommend to anyone."
2266,Alfie Back,"This book was not what I was expecting. The writing, especially for someone who had never wrote a fiction book before, was amazing! It was so easy to follow and I found myself thinking about the 'who done it' a lot. when I picked this up in the bookstore i didn't think it would be as good as it was. I'm not a huge fan of diary form writing. The books split into three POV's Rachel Anna and Megan. In the beginning I found myself hating reading Anna's side of the story. Until the end where everything happens to her and Rachel. In my opinion the beginning of the story was a little slow paced which is fine but it all made sense. I really loved the Jess and Jason idea. And I did want to slap Rachel at times because she forgets a lot because of her drinking. the last about 30 pages WOW. The way Paula Hawkins put that all together. It just made perfect sense! Everything came together and you get annoyed with yourself that you didn't think of that. The least suspecting character. I thought it was Anna because she was such a bitch but I guess you will have to find out who did it ;) and what it is they did.... I loved the fact The author picked up on many controversial issues like Alcohol and domestic abuse. And wrote so carefully with detail about it. I think this is good as a lot of people can relate (unfortunately) I think this might be one of the reasons this book has done so well. Well done Paula Hawkins for writing this amazing book! "
2267,Miranda Hazrati,"Nailbitingly tense and un-downable thriller å la 'Gone Girl'. The central character Rachel is an alcoholic prone to blackouts and harbours an unhealthy obsession with her ex-husband Tom. Despite having being fired from her job months ago, Rachel continues her daily commute, taking the same train every day and enjoying spying on the occupants of one particular house en route on a street where we later learn she used to live before her own life unravelled. One morning Rachel spots something amiss and when the girl she has been watching goes missing, Rachel goes to the police, feeling she has seen something which could be important to the investigation. The narrative skillfully skips between Rachel and two other women Anna (Tom's new wife) and Megan (the missing girl) whose lives become tragically interlinked. Can we trust drunken, often irrational Rachel's narrative? Dismissed as a 'rubbernecker' by the police and constantly badgering her ex with obsessive phonecalls, is she a reliable witness? Brilliantly constructed thriller which keeps the reader guessing until the end. "
2268,Jenn of Back Off My Books,"4.5/5Do you enjoy a good physiological who dun it? Need that fix of the dark and suspenseful? Don't mind some seriously messed up people? This book is for you. I started it is and found that after 20% I couldn't put it down, I wanted to know what was happening.This book tells the story of a woman gone missing from the POV of three women who as time goes on it becomes quite clear are more than they seem.I found myself disappointed in the characters multiple time through out the story but the author was crafty enough to take the disappointment and disgust and mellow it out and make you want to read more, learn more about them. I found myself thinking constantly after 50% ""What is wrong with these people!??!""Rachel is the first woman we are introduced to and we see through her POV that she has crafted lives and personalities for the man and woman she sees each morning on the train to London. She names them and stories for them, a rather innocuous thing that many of us make a game out of when we are people watching. This takes a horrible turn into the sad and pathetic realm when a devastating revelation comes about that has Rachel wanting to immerse herself more into their lives.I did not see the ending coming early on, I was just as perplexed as several characters in the book. As the story unfolds and the clues get placed before you and the reality becomes clear you soon learn that some people are just messed the eff up in the head.A must read if you like a good psychological thriller and this one focuses the story around the women involved. In fact I was reading this when I watched Gone Girl for the first time (never read the book) and it gave me that same people are messed up and omg feel."
2269,Stephy Jay,This book is absolutely fantastic. Best one I have read for a long time. A real page turner
2270,Tara Holman,"I was extremely eager to get on board with reading The Girl on the Train and waited patiently until my turn on the wait list at the local library. Upon starting this story, I would have been easily able to finish in one sitting but ultimately real life prevailed and I couldn't. This was no testament to the compelling story that Paula Hawkins tells. Very much in the same vein as Gone Girl and Big Little Lies, we are told the story from three separate female characters that are all entwined in one way or another. We are introduced to the ""main"" character Rachel, the sad & depressing underdog that I found myself rooting for, albeit I was infuriated with some of her choices. There is Anna, the ""other woman"" that you hate and then Megan, the woman no one knows too much about, yet Rachel is obsessed with her life via the small peeks inside her home from the train. These women are characters that as a reader you will love, hate and sometimes scream at your book on account of. When someone goes missing and the women have different memories of what happened that fateful night, a pile of clothes on the side of the tracks and flashes of recollect can turn the true past into the scary future where everything you have always believed to be true are not and the people you think you know so well and love and trust are not what they seem. A thrilling who-done-it that keeps you guessing until the very end- If you have not read this book yet, you are doing yourself an injustice!"
2271,Larena,"Contemporary Suspense, Romantic elementsLondonEvery day Rachel takes the same commuter train. Each day she goes by a stretch of cozy suburban homes and stops at a signal that lets her watch the same couple as they have breakfast on their deck. Every day she looks forward to it. After so much time she feels like she knows them and she calls them Jess and Jason. As far as she can tell their life is perfect. Like the life she recently lost.Then one day she sees something that shocks her. It takes just a minute before the train moves on but it is long enough. Now nothing is the same. Rachel goes to the police to share what she knows. The police though feel she is unreliable but is she? All too soon she is deeply entangled in the lives of those involved. She is also deeply involved in the investigation. Now the question is has she done more harm than good. This is a great suspense story that keeps the reader engrossed until the very end. Just as the reader thinks they know where the story is headed it takes another twist that will have readers wondering just how this one is going to end. The characters are well written and so is the plot. While some readers might figured out how it is going to end there is still enough twists that it will keep readers turning the pages. This is one story that readers will find very hard to put down and will stay up all night to finish. This is one book that is a must read. "
2272,Jeimy,"I was reluctant to pick up this book. You know how it can be: Everyone is raving about this one book, you get it, and are disappointed when it does not live up to the hype. It is what happened to me when I read Gone Girl, and what I feared would happen when I began reading this book yesterday.At first I was focusing on the fact that the narrators were annoying, not to mention unreliable. At some point, I realized that I was past that. Regardless of how irritating these women were, the tale they told was captivating and left me wanting more. Once it started barreling towards the revelation of what had transpired the night of the murder and the final climactic confrontation, I could not put it down. Actually, that is not true. During several scenes my heart was pounding so forcefully that I had to walk away and take deep breaths.Ratingwise, it should be a 4.5, but for me it was closer to five than four so I gave it the extra half star. If you like suspense: read this book. My book had a Tess Gerritsen blurb on the cover and her words are spot on: it will suck up your entire afternoon. Enjoy and let me know what you thought."
2273,Wendy LaCapra,"I really enjoyed this book. The male characters are interesting, but, oh, the women! The female characters are Complex, challenging, human, broken & real. I think it is a mistake just to focus on the reliability of the narrator, because, although that does heighten the experience, there are complex themes about marriage and motherhood that deserve equal tension. To sum up: a thrilling, chilling mystery with finely drawn female characters portrayed without a whiff of judgement who will stay with you long after the story is over!"
2274,Maui,"This book is worth it to be awarded as Best in Mystery and Thriller for this year's Goodreads Choice Awards. I swear it racked my brain back and forth. I'm a newbie in reading this type of genre and I love how I turn into a fast reader when I'm reading because I want to know who the killer is! Hahaha!For this book, first of all I admit I thought of Gone Girl while reading but The Girl On Train was different. This was more complicated than Gone Girl but I loved it. "
2275,Tammy S. Weibel,The Girl on the Train is a hot mess. Her story is a nonstop page turner. No one is what they seem.
2276,April,"As a fan of psychological thrillers and mysteries, I loved the way this was written. From the very beginning, I was hooked and couldn't wait to find out what really happened. "
2277,Rebecca Stephenson,"Now THIS is A PAGE TURNER! I literally could not put this book down because it had me hooked within moments when reading the first chapter. ""Girl on the Train"" is a twisted psychological thriller told through multiple character perspectives- all cleverly woven together by this talented author. I see that there's been a lot references and comparisons to ""Gone Girl"" amongst other readers but let me just say it's entirely different- a big common aspect however is the whole ""things are not what they seem"". If you liked ""Gone Girl"", you definitely will enjoy reading this book but I would definitely give credit when credit due in that ""Girl on the Train"" stands firmly on its own in this type of genre and I will be eagerly looking forward to reading more of this author's works."
2278,Agostina Donati,"El final me dejó recalculando como 10min. Eso hace una buena historia, congelarte el cerebro hasta que no sepas ni qué pensar. La historia me atrapó desde el principio y me dejaba siempre queriendo leer más. No adiviné nunca el final, en cada capítulo cambiaba de parecer y cada vez se volvía más complicado así que no tenia la más PÁLIDA idea de qué iba a pasar. Gracias a Dios no esperaba grandes cosas de este libro. Había leído a mucha gente que iba con las expectativas de que sería el próximo Gone Girl (uno de mis libros favoritos) y se había decepcionado por eso. Así que mis expectativas al empezarlo eran pocas. Y creo que eso ayudó a que el libro me gustara tanto. Así que les recomiendo que no lean muchas críticas, que no averigüen mucho de qué trata. Vayan a comprarlo, empiecen a leer y listo. Me fascinó, en serio. Había momentos en los que no podía parar de leer y me abstraía del mundo, y eso es todo lo que busco de un libro. PD: Hawkins estás del carajo! Escribite algo más, dale. "
2279,Malvika Souran,"I had a great time reading, rather listening to this book! I got the audible version of The Girl on the Train. Definitely drove many extra miles , just because I did not want to stop listening. Book is nicely crafted and even though all characters are primarily flawed , you keep turning pages to know what happens next in this Psychological thriller. You have to give credit to Paula Hawkins superb narration. Despite a slow start,the book picks up and the author manages to keep readers engaged till they reach the very end. Having read thrillers all my life, I for one, was definitely taken by surprise at the big reveal in the end & that fact alone is an absolute winner for me when it comes to thrillers. If you are looking for an entertaining thriller, look no further! The Girl on the Train is here !"
2280,Lisa Eirene,"I don't even know where to start. The word ""wow"" comes to mind but that doesn't properly illustrate how good this book was. It was compared to ""Gone Girl"" and I went in skeptical but quickly realized, oh yeah. It's like Gone Girl. It's like GG in that it is so dark, so unique you can't stop thinking about it. How do you read a book where the main character is just so despicable that it's almost painful to read? You get sucked in by good writing and you can't put the book down. This one succeeded in that.I loved how the author slowly rolled out the story. The first few chapters are just about this girl, Rachel, on a train. The same morning train, and the same evening train, going into London for work. The train goes by a group of houses and she creates a story in her head about the people living in one of the houses--even gives them a name. Rachel sees a new pink curtain in the window of another house and it makes her sad, but you don't realize until several chapters later why. Turns out, she used to live in the house with the new pink curtain. Until her husband Tom kicked her out and moved in his mistress, Anna, who became his new wife and they had a daughter. Turns out, Rachel is a raging alcohol who blacks out and doesn't remember anything she does or says when drunk. Turns out she's harassing Tom and Anna when she blacks out--phone calls, harassing notes, stalking them at the house--her old house.I don't want to give anymore away because the story twists and turns in such a brilliant way. This is probably one of the best books I've read in a really long time. I could not stop reading it and even now, finished with the book, I feel so many different emotions!!"
2281,Shelley,"Joder. ¿En serio?. No puede ser. No puedo salir del asombro. ¡Qué genial novela!. Me tuvo todo el tiempo entretenida, no podía dejar de leerla. Hay algo, tal vez la manera en la que está escrita, aún no lo sé, pero hay algo que hizo que pueda meterme realmente en la historia. Es decir, entendía perfectamente como se sentía cada personaje. Llegué a entender a Anna, y voy a recalcar que me parece un personaje totalmente odioso, y no pude soportarla en ningún momento. Nunca, pero nunca sospeché de quien lo hizo. Aún no puedo creerlo. Parecía un personaje convincente y dentro de sus cabales, pero demostró todo lo contrario en... ¿cuánto?, ¿dos líneas tal vez?.Al principio a todos los personajes se los veía de una manera diferente, y me encanta la idea de que recién un poco más allá del final se muestre como son cada uno en verdad. Nunca nada es lo que parece. En serio. Nunca. Me sentí muy complacida por Rachel, me gustó mucho su evolución en toda la historia. Anna, vuelvo a repetir, no salió del papel de odiosa. Tom y Scott... bueno. Son Tom y Scott. Parecían tan diferentes. Siento pena por ambos. Más por Scott, quién sabe a donde fue a parar. En fin, cinco estrellas bien merecidas. "
2282,Leslie Schuler,I love a book that lets me get nothing done all day because I can't put it down. Loved it! 
2283,Cleo Bannister,"What a relief to know that I am not the only person who looks out of a train window and makes up stories for the inhabitants, that is how we meet our chief protagonist Rachel. Sitting on a train commuting to London the train routinely stops at lights in one particular stop. Rachel spots a couple sitting on their makeshift roof terrace and assigns them names, Jessie and Jason, and an idyllic life to match. As we get to know Rachel better we begin to understand why this essentially imaginary couple are so important to her. Rachel is unhappily divorced, living in a shared house and she’s an alcoholic but fear not this book while ensuring the consequences of her drinking are clear doesn’t play us endless scenes of her drinking herself into oblivion, it is far cleverer than that giving instead a taster of her morning and evening from a selection of days starting on 5 July 2013 and ending on 18 August of the same year.When one routine morning she sees something that shatters her views of her imaginary couple and this event becomes an obsession as its significance is revealed. This is an ingeniously constructed story told not only from Rachel’s viewpoint, but those of two other women, Anna and Megan too. Megan’s story begins a year before Anna’s and although the relevance of her story isn’t immediately apparent I still wanted to know more about her. As the story progresses the way these three women’s lives are connected becomes apparent, and then the fun really starts with the action ramping up along with the tension. With the split in viewpoint perfectly timed so that the reader doesn’t feel that the switch has been purposely inserted to prolong the suspense, although it certainly does that.I was hooked on this story, I trusted not one of the characters, I’ll be honest, none of them are people you’d aspire to be, rather they are people with issues, unfortunate personalities and they all picked up too many narcissistic genes from the gene pool, but the author manages to keep them the right side of caricatures, unfortunates among you may have met people just like them. The plot is full of sub-plots which almost compels you to judge these people and their behaviour which just served to fuel my suspicions about each and every one of them even more.This is an accomplished debut written by an author who has exactly the right balance of ingredients for a psychological suspense novel, a well-plotted mystery, a handful of life-like characters, events revealed at the right time and an ending that didn’t disappoint.I’d like to thank the publishers Transworld for allowing me to read a proof copy of this book ahead of publication date on 15 January 2015 and I sincerely hope Paula Hawkins has another book in the pipeline."
2284,Filippa,*4.5 stars* I really enjoyed this book!!
2285,Sera,"this book was great. I have heard people say that the characters are unlikeable, but what they are is human. flawed and ugly humans, like the ones that exist in real life. I didn't piece together what was going on until I was almost finished with the book, and i was very grateful for that. I am not sure if that was oblivion on my part or a job well done on Paula Hawkin's, but when I finally realized what was going on, I was giddy with surprise. I love when i get taken off guard. However, I'm not sure if the ending was too fast, or if i read it too fast. Anyways, the book was excellent. I started it having no idea what it was about, and ripped through it. Highly recommend. "
2286,Masha Chaffee,One of the best thrillers I have read in a long time! Difficult to put down.
2287,Bobbie,Loved this book! 
2288,Tabitha,"Freaking fantastic! Multiple narrators done so well, with such purpose. The plot has you guessing until almost the very end. "
2289,Kate Templeton,"I read this book over 24 hours at the beach and it was perfect. Couldn't put it down. Everyone felt like a suspect and I kept thinking I knew who was the ""bad guy,"" and was only sort of right in the end. Good character development and a solid plot, even if it has been done before. Recommend!"
2290,Richard Guion,"Totally compelling and gripping - I had to read this one as quickly as possible. What's unique about this mystery is that the main protagonist, Rachel, narrates the story and tells about a house she sees everyday on the train. Then we flip between Rachel and two other women, Megan and Anna, and hear their side of the story. Each of them reveals a different piece of the puzzle. I did the Kindle whisper sync thing with this one and got the Audible version too - I highly, highly recommend the audiobook. There are 3 different narrators for each woman, all excellent, but I found the one who spoke for Megan - Louise Brealey - her performance was haunting. Even if I was reading on the Kindle, when it came to Megan's chapters, I had to stop and switch the to listen to her read the chapter."
2291,Nelleke,"De meningen over dit boek zijn verdeeld: lezers noemen het een deprimerend boek over beschadigde mensen. Dat is het ook. Het is meer een psychologische roman dan een thriller. Maar wat het zo goed maakt, is dat het zo geloofwaardig geschreven is. Geen sensationele plotwendingen maar een verhaal met levensechte karakters en de omderhuidse spanning wordt langzaam opgebouwd. De situaties lijken allemaal heel alledaags, wie zit er niet in de trein naar de achterkant van huizen te kijken en zich af te vragen wat daar allemaal gebeurt? Het is een boek dat beklijft, in tegenstelling tot veel thrillers waarvan je binnen een dag al weer vergeten bent waar ze ook al weer over gingen."
2292,Melissa ,"All the below are my probably annoying over excited updates along the way posted on various websites, bit mostly here, but I truly need to breathe. There's no cozy up and have a nice cup of tea with this one. There's grab the closest and strongest drink and know that being in a constant state of tension will be your best friend while you're reading and my advice if you plan to sleep......don't plan to sleep, eat or breathe. Just read!! I feel like my inside a have been twisted and pulled and tied into knots and left here sitting without mercy insanely and deliciously traumatized.

January 13-14, 2015 update: HEA books have made me cry, but #TheGirlOnTheTrain I can't explain. It's suspense, crime, thriller, mystery!? Why? How? Is it building up tears inside ready to burst from my eyes? I'm holding back a powerful sense of tears. My eyes want to gush tears! I cannot understand how a book of this genre is doing this. It's intense! Insanely intense so I guess the build up of what's happening is making me nearly burst. I keep putting it down to breathe & also because I don't want it to end!

2293,Debra Daniels-zeller,"This book had intriguing characters and the mystery was compelling. I liked the pace, which perked along alternating view points of Rachel, Megan and Anna and I liked the alcoholic flaw of the main character. I stayed up nights reading this one to find out what happened to Megan and would anyone ever aknowledge Rachel? Creepy but a good read."
2294,Lisa-Jaine,"I loved this book, i loved how there were so many twists and turns and how the story unfolds leading us into the lives of those in Blenheim Road. Im not going to ramble on about the storyline as the book's synopsis already does this, but it was well written and kept me turning the pages."
2295,Amy,"The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins. In Hawkins' first thriller, the story is told in the style of Gone Girl reflecting through Rachel, Anna and Megan's memories. It quickly picks up and like a train speeds rapidly through the pages.Readers along on the high-charged journey will find themselves second-guessing the characters' motives. A chilling murder, psychological flashbacks, plot twists and a climax that begs for release, those who get over the threshold will find themselves holding their breath until the killer is revealed. "
2296,Jsavett1,"WOW! So if you've read any of my reviews before you'll notice that this type of book is quite different than my usual fare. I'm not sure what compelled me to give it a whirl. It's been compared to Gone Girl which I didn't read but saw with my wife, and boy was that creepy. Then I read a review calling it disturbing like Hitchcock. That got me very interested. Finally, on the back of the book, Laura Kasischke, one of my very favorite contemporary POETS gave it a glowing blurb.So I was all in for the ride (no pun intended) from then on. I read a lot of poetry. I read a lot of history. I read a lot of Raymond Carver and John Cheever stories. And you know what? This was really good. It's not particularly literary; it's not well written in an aesthetic sense. But Hawkins does a fine job of building and holding suspense through the now commonplace technique of switching narrative points of view with each chapter. Had I read Gone Girl or many other suspense novels which do this I probably would have been annoyed at the cliche. But I enjoyed it here. I had to look back at previous chapters to check their dates and their authors. I even took a few notes in the margin to keep track of my reactions. The characters are a LITTLE more than types, not much. But I wasn't reading this book for character. This isn't Roth. It's a VERY successful thriller that, in the end, DOES have the quality of Hitchcock spookiness. Cue the requisite stormy nights and unreliable narrators, But this is also about the dark places which make us want to run up the steps at night, worried someone will grab at our heels as we make our way to the people with whom we're sure we're safe. Hawkins knows how to manipulate these fears masterfully, and for that, she deserves credit and my five stars. "
2297,Lydia,"I can't... let me just say this book isn't for the faint of heart. It deals with many serious issues: alcoholism, betrayal, lies, love (and love lost.) This is not light reading. This is thought-provoking, heart-wrenching work. And you will love every bit of it. (Even if you'll feel like putting on a happy Disney movie after to lift your spirits.)Rachel is an alcoholic, sad, lonely and depressed. She pines after her ex-husband and her perfect life. She rides the train every morning pretending to go to work so her kind landlady/friend would not realize she'd lost her job. Rachel is an empathetic character and you'll love her despite her flaws. Throughout the book you will see snippets of other women's point of view: Anna, Rachel's ex-husband's mistress turned wife, and Megan, Anna's neighbor, ex-babysitter, wife to a jealous husband. One day, Megan goes missing.Rachel throws herself into the mystery. It feels good to have something distracting her from her sorrow. And we, the readers, are absorbed into her investigation, her struggles, her pain. And secrets begin to unveil themselves, slowly, keeping readers guessing till the very end.Halfway through I felt I needed some sunshine and fresh air, because the description was so vivid, so real, that I felt choked by Rachel's depiction of alcoholism and depression. Despite all that, I could not stop reading. What happened to Megan? What happened the night Megan disappeared - the night Rachel cannot remember? A riveting thriller, and one with a great ending. The writing is masterful, and the plot unravels at perfect speed. Well worth the hype! This one is highly recommended if you don't mind darker, emotionally intense fiction. "
2298,Balu,"If Alfred Hitchcock was alive he would turn this one into a Masterpiece...If you read GoneGirl and if you like it, Im sure you gonne love this oneThe Girl on the Train travels with good pace, with twists and turns in every halt..Paula Hawkins make an fantastic debut with this one, which makes the reader unpredictable To be frank it was the first time i came across completely different writing style which makes the suspense more gripping..Hawkins holds group of charecters so perfectly not to reveal the suspense and makes the reader to travel with them till the end of the book Take a Bow Paula Hawkins for the fantastic gripping Debut thriller Loved itundoubtedly this will be one of the best books released this year"
2299,Jeannie,"I could not put this one down, highly recommend!"
2300,Adam Nicholls,"I'd had my eye on this book for a while, and when I finally got around to reading it, I wasn't disappointed. Paula Hawkins's debut novel is full of tension, and she has a superb way of leaving a chapter in a way that just grabs you by the short ones and forces you to keep reading. It's very rare that I finish a book and still think about it without rushing to the next book, but this time I just can't help it. This is an excellent story and it's superbly told with full, real, relatable characters."
2301,Rajesh Ram,"Just finished reading The Girl on the Train. Evocative of Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl, yet this is a wholly different beast. Finely crafted plot and wonderful imagery by Paula Hawkins.*""My head leaning against the carriage window, I watch these houses roll past me like a tracking shot in a film. I see them as others do not; even their owners probably don’t see them from this perspective. Twice a day, I am offered a view into other lives, just for a moment. There’s something comforting about the sight of strangers safe at home.""*A gruesome tale of voyeurism, discontent and longing for love. A whodunit filled with intrigue that fits squarely in Hitchock/Fincher territory.Rachel is weary of her own life; she finds solace in fantasizing about the life of a young couple in a house she passes by everyday while commuting on the train. From being a passive onlooker, how does she becomes entangled in their lives? Will she find her footing in a murky world of lies, betrayal and shifting realities?Having an unreliable narrator prone to blackouts, trying to piece together events from the day of the crime, is a masterstroke from the author. The voices of Rachel, Megan and Anna are still ringing in my ears...*""We're tied together, forever bound by the stories we told...""https://rajeshmoviegoer.wordpress.com..."
2302,Corrine Coleman,"Got this book as a Christmas gift. Excellent. Simply excellent. It wasn't even the plot that intrigued me - though I must say the suspense certainly kept me on my toes - it was the author's ability to bring the characters to life - to move me. They were all flawed, yes - and maybe to some people it was depressing. But that only means the author did her job and did it well. Beautiful written. It was the first time in a long time I couldn't put a book down. "
2303,Beth Hatch,As good as Gone Girl
2304,Tamara Grand,Very 'Gone Girl'. Loved the alternating viewpoints and didn't suspect the ending until the final 30 pages! A fantastic read. Hope this author has started on book #2!
2305,Ardi,WOW. Wow. Just.... Wow. 
2306,Bobbi ,What can I say? The narration was top notch. The characters were completely messed up. I spent most of the book looking for twists and clues and was still somewhat surprised when the first clues were reveled about the real killer. (view spoiler)[(That nasty Anna didn't surprise me in the least.) (hide spoiler)]
2307,Christie Pepper,"The characters are so compelling. At times you fall in love with them, then pity them, then can't stand them, but you feel like you know each and everyone of them well. It is perfectly paced, you fall into the beginning and are captivated straight to the ending where the twists are unexpected. The alternating points of view were a little offsetting at times and the dates seemed to be too much work to figure out, but the story is so well written and told, there is no need to worry about the dates. "
2308,Deb,I was totally hooked and unable to put it down! A great read. Lots of suspense. You'll love it if you loved the Gillian Flynn novels. 
2309,Deedee Dohlman,Every bit as good as Gone Girl.
2310,Chelsea,"More reviews available at my blog, Beauty and the Bookworm.I read Gone Girl recently, so The Girl on the Train seemed like the next logical step, given how often people compare them. Having finished it, I can see why they do--but also feel like the comparison doesn't really do either book justice, as they're not really similar in a larger sense. Both feature people behaving badly and narrators who could be classified as unreliable--but whereas a narrator in Gone Girl is intentionally unreliable, none of the narrators in The Girl on the Train are intentionally misleading. The bad behaviors are similar in part--you know, murder, adultery, mental and emotional manipulation, the usual--but are set up in such a different context that they work into the story very differently. The Girl on the Train also seemed to move faster, to me--maybe because all of the characters become involved so early on, while in Gone Girl things just keep coming up slowly.Anyway. The Girl on the Train follows Rachel, who is pretty much a hot mess. She's an unemployed alcoholic (and yes, the two are related) who has been in a sort of limbo ever since she and her husband divorced two years ago. Well, really the mess of her life started earlier than that, when they tried to have a kid and couldn't, sending Rachel into a spiral that ended in their divorce. She has a roommate now, and to hide her unemployment she still takes the train into London every day. On the way, she looks at the houses by the tracks, particularly one a few doors down from where she used to live so that she can see the couple she has deemed ""Jason"" and ""Jess,"" who she imagines to be wildly in love with each other--until she sees Jess with another man. Several days later, news comes out that a woman has gone missing, and by her picture Rachel immediately realizes it's Jess. She gets swept up in the drama of the entire investigation, hooked by her imaginings of Jason and Jess' life together, even though she knows that those aren't really their names and that their lives were really nothing like she pictured in her head. Out of all the characters in this book, Rachel is the only good one. Yes, she is an alcoholic--but her life is pretty shit, so that's pretty understandable, and as the story goes on she tries to improve herself. The other characters (well, with the exception of a few supporting folk, like Rachel's roommate and the guy on the train) are all abusive, manipulative, and cheaters, in various combinations of those characteristics. This made it very easy to root for Rachel, to want her to figure it all out and improve her own life into the bargain, though the logic of how that would, exactly, tie in is somewhat missing. On the other hand, it's hard to want to root for a character who wants to ""get rid of the bitch once and for all"" or who spends her time having a string of affairs or any number of other poor behaviors exhibited by the people in this novel.The mystery is intriguing because there are so many different possibilities for who killed Jess/Megan, and to some degree all of them make sense. As the layers of the story get pulled back, everything becomes more and more tangled, more and more twisted, until the big reveal and the climax.I think I liked this more than Gone Girl, overall; it wasn't as long, it moved faster, and I found the characters more intriguing on the whole than those in Gone Girl. And Rachel was a much more relatable protagonist than Nick, who I never really liked because of the shitty choices he made. Rachel made shitty choices, too, but not like Nick did. And come on--Girl on the Train is British, which just makes absolutely everything sound so much more posh and sophisticated, don't you think? Sure, the logic of ""woman solves mystery and therefore improves her own life"" isn't entirely there, but that's not really the point of the genre, and so I'm willing to give it a pass on that one. I loved this, and heartily recommend it. Also, it can count for the Popsugar 2016 Reading Challenge category of ""A book being made into a movie this year."" Yay!"
2311,Lynn Mccarthy,What a brilliant book kept me engaged all the way through a must read 
2312,Maureen Mack,"Oh my! I have been studying novel writing techniques and Hawkins has nailed it with this fast paced thriller. It is not going to be a literary option for the Pulitzer for fiction but it will most likely get a movie deal.The story captivates the reader from the first page. The characters are flawed beyond understanding but that is part of the appeal. As you continue to make your way through the story, you can't help but wonder how you would act/react to both the interpersonal and intrapersonal conflicts the book develops.It does make you reflect on the weaknesses that woman have when they give too much of themselves to a relationship instead of building their own identity. Yet, it also makes you reflect on the bad choices you may have made in your own life and if you are lucky, how you walked away just in time."
2313,Amanda Toyer,Awesome! Loved it - great ending. Reminded me of many frustrating journeys on the Thameslink into London. 
2314,Jenny,"I really enjoy a book that keeps you guessing on who-done-it. And I kept flipping through multiple people in this book and coming back to them multiple times. So it was a fun book to try to figure out. I hope that Rachel stays clean. It is nice to see an author portray a female alcoholic as it's almost always a male, however, there are plenty of females as well.So the story is about a girl, Rachel, riding a train every day to London for work, or later pretending to work. Every day the train stops at a signal where she ends up lined up behind a house down the street from where her ex-husband lives with his new wife (mistress while they were married) and Rachel fantasies and creates a story for ""Jess"" and ""Jason"" and how happily they are married. Then the train will roll on and she'll see her old house. Soon with pink blinds in one window, they are having a baby.So one night Rachel is out and she's drinking and she ends up blacking out and ends up home in her bed but doesn't remember how she got there or what happened the night before. And soon she see the news and finds that ""Jess"" is missing and that her name is Megan. Her husband is the prime suspect. Rachel had seen Megan kissing another man on their back deck that day though while she was riding the train. So she tries to tell Scott, ""Jason"" about this. And the detectives. Her story isn't enough though when the police realize she's a drunk. So the rest of the book goes through Megan's point of view in her last few months before she was missing, and Rachel's current time trying to regain her memory. While also trying to avoid her ex-husband and his new wife Anna. As Anna hates Rachel and wants her gone. Tom, Rachel's ex-husband, keeps telling Rachel to stay away from them, but since Rachel keeps trying to talk to Scott and help him with finding Megan she is passing her old house all the time. A very inter-twisted story of these 5 people. A gripping, and psychological, suspenseful book."
2315,Diana,"What a roller coaster ride! This book had incredible and unanticipated twists and turns. Without giving away any plot, the writing style perfectly fit the main character's sometimes misguided and often frantic mindset. I was at the edge of my seat! I look forward to reading the next book from Paula Hawkins!"
2316,Diane,Thrilling and gripping. An Addictive read. A must read.

2318,Kristine,Holy guacamole. 
2319,Jessi,"
That's right Fergie Ferg, I was completely addicted to this book, properly obsessed, didn't want to put it down.With every chapter some new secret is revealed and you realize everything you think you know...YOU DON'T KNOW SHIT.So I won't be able to do this review without spoiling the book so...JESSI BOOK CASTING!So what do we know?We have Rachel
Rachel is a mess, used to be gorgeous vivacious happy girl who is now taking the train everyday into the city under the guise of going to her job that she no longer has, semi stalking her ex husband, his new wife and daughter, and fantasizing about a couple who live down the lane from her old home. Also quite a bit of day drinking.Her Ex husband, Tom
Tom is a hottie who may still have feelings for Rachel but is possibly the king of mixed signalsTom's new wife Anna
In all honesty I never warm to her and at several points was kind of like
Then we have the neighborsMegan/Jess
Clearly many issues for poor Megan, also following her train of thought was like herding cats. and Scott/Jason
Another hottie who you were not sure if you should feel bad for or be terrified of.Enjoyed this book so much couldn't put it down but seriously they were all kind of (view spoiler)[ C**ts weren't they?  (hide spoiler)]"
2320,Jenni,"Loved this. Could not put it down! At its heart, this book is about being a voyeur, about creating stories about strangers so that you have somewhere to belong. The author does an incredible job of building suspense and drawing you into the characters' lives, almost as though you yourself are a voyeur. My only critiques: The three main female characters are all hot messes who rely on men or booze to make them whole; in fact, they love being mistresses because it makes them feel desired. I would've loved to see some stronger, more fully developed female characters. And while the book kept me on my toes the whole time, the very end felt somewhat like an episode of Scooby Doo: Once the villain is revealed, he/she spills the beans in a long-winded confession that feels a little forced.4.5 stars really. I highly recommend this one!"
2321,Laura Broder,Couldn't put it down!!!
2322,Jenng,Loved the realness of the main character.
2323,Kunal Garg,It keeps you hooked till the very end. A murder mystery which doesn't reveals all it's cards till the end. It was a fun read.
2324,Jenna,"At first, I wasn't sure I would like this book. The main character was hard to like, but then things got interesting and I didn't want to put the book down. I really had no idea who the ""bad guy"" was until the end! "
2325,Books Passion,Review:http://giuliana-bookspassion.blogspot...
2326,MaryBeth Isaac,"Who is the girl on the train? The woman you are introduced to on page one is one person. The woman you become familiar is someone else. This book is ingeniously exposes all as the story unfolds, bit by bit. Rachel is the ""Girl on the Train"" and the central character. Little details are slowly revealed - Rachel's commute, the people she observes, where she lives, how she lives, and why. Just when you think you know the story or know the characters, another fact is dropped...another twist develops. Sometimes you will feel sorry for Rachel. Other times you will be proud of her, rooting for her, afraid for her, frustrated with her or angry with her. It will not stop you from turning the page! Just when you think you have it figured out...you realize that you don't. I did figure out a couple of key components in the plot, but now before a lot of other scenarios crossed my mind with a good bit of second guessing thrown in.This novel will be difficult to put down and will keep you guessing until the end. "
2327,Twobchelm,"I didn't think I would like, no love this book at the beginning but it grabbed hold and I couldn't put it down. The author did a masterful job of keeping the suspense going with all the twists of the human mind! A great read!"
2328,Alla,"“The Girl On The Train” by Paula Hawkins is set in England and follows Rachel Watson—a middle-aged alcoholic with a broken heart who takes the train every day to London and notices a happy-looking couple who live at one of the stops. She nicknames the Jess and Jason, and gazes out the window at them every time the train reaches their spot – being secretly jealous of their seemingly idyllic relationship, while nursing her own broken heart for Tom, a man who has since re-married and had one child with Anna, his new wife, and who incidentally live close by to Jess and Jason. Soon, however, Rachel learns that everything is not as it seems—when she spies Jess kissing another man, and soon after learns of her disappearance. Rachel eventually learns that Jess’s and Jason’s real names are Megan and Scott, and becomes obsessed with solving Megan’s disappearance.The story is told from the point of view of Rachel, flash-backs from Megan (prior to her disappearance), and Anna—Rachel’s beloved ex’s current wife. All three are complicated characters—especially Rachel, who is full of self-loathing and disappointment at the sudden interruption of her imagined fairy tale of what a happy couple’s life would look like, while being unable to get over her breakup with Tom and his new life without her. On one of the days, Rachel takes the train, sees a man, blacks out, and comes to with a mysterious bump on her head—blacking out on all of the day’s events. Interestingly this happens to be at the same time as Megan disappears. So Rachel’s narration of the events is filled with this big black hole. So is Megan’s—as while we learn about the events leading up to her disappearance, it remains unclear what caused it. And then there’s Anna’s narration—which reveals she has a dark side to her as well. Ultimately, this story turns into a “who can we trust” as it increasingly seems that the answer is no one—as the web of events shaping the mystery keeps getting tighter. Rachel loves Tom who loves Anna who hires Megan as a babysitter for their child, while Megan is married to Scott but is not the ideal wife she pretends to be. Ultimately, this story is shaped as a “whodunit,” but goes a lot deeper than that. This thriller touches upon many themes, including obsessive love, cheating, stalking, alcoholism, mid-life crisis, domestic violence, jealousy, hatred, and deceit among many others. At its core, this is a very dark story, with strong characters set against the backdrop of the disappearance of one of the central characters, a quest to solve the disappearance and get her old life back from another, as well as a goal to get rid of her husband’s harasser once and for all from the third. Overall, I thought it was a dark and engaging mystery. "
2329,Nats,"For VERY good reason there is huge hype surrounding this book once I picked it up it was very hard for me to put down.The Story is told from 3 points of view Rachel, Megan and Anna which works perfectly as it gave totally different aspects to the story. The story kept me on my toes throughout and I did not work out the major twist which occurs. Some Characters were not likable but this did not spoil by enjoyment of the book. A fantastic debut from Paula Hawkins."
2330,Danielle Belwater,"I haven't read a book that I loved this much in a long time. I can't really explain how I feel, it had me tied in knots the whole time. Sympathising with Rachel when I felt that perhaps I shouldn't. I always get a very uneasy, unsettled feeling when someone writes or I hear about a baby's death and I think this added to the mystery and feeling of depth of the book. Do not expect a happy, fluff ending. Having only just finished it a minute ago, I'm going to have to sit on this book and think about how I feel about it and what I thought. I might even read it again to get a better understanding of the characters.But bloody brilliant is all I can say. "
2331,Jennifer Sappington,Excellent read. I am usually not a fan of books where the characters are so hard to like but I really enjoyed this novel. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a bit of drama and intrigue.
2332,Sudie,What a great read-twists and turns galore. I couldn't put it down!
2333,Ally,This book 100% lived up to its hype; it is *masterfully* written. I won't say any more about it because you should really read it blindly but suffice it to say I loved everything about it and hopefully you will too. 
2334,Leigh Mitchell,Could not put this book down. I did figure out what had happened just before it came out in the book. Really good read.
2335,Christina Monson,"Read it!You won't be able to stop turning the pages!Suspenseful, we'll developed, captivating plot with a twist and characters intertwined throughout."
2336,Lexie,"I was very excited to read this novel because of its classification as a psychological thriller. Though this book was a thriller, I'm not sure I would call it psychological.This story was certainly a mystery, but it was fairly straight forward. There were things that were slowly revealed and some surprises, but I was never caught truly off-guard realizing that I had been interpreting something wrong all along. With that being said, I still loved this book. It constantly kept my attention and never left me bored. I loved the switching back and forth between the different characters. My favorite character to keep track of was Rachel. I am still slightly confused about Anna and what her true personality is, but I'm thinking that if I were to read the book a few more times I might be able to figure her out.The one thing that bothered me was that I found quite a few grammar mistakes. I understand that this was written in Europe which has some different rules, but I know that these were mistakes and not just a cultural difference. When I ran across them I became distracted and it interrupted the flow of my reading. However, I was generally able to quickly forgive these mistakes and continue on. I would definitely consider adding this book to my collection. "
2337,Elsa,What a page turner. I had to keep reading; couldn't put it down!
2338,Maddy,So addictive! 
2339,Fatima Calderon,"Don't compare it to Gone GirlJust because there's a diary, this is not the same novel.Yes, there's also an unreliable narrator but that's where the similarities end.God I loved this book. Had me on edge, making theories, not believing, going back for clues, feeling sorry for all women, especially for the girl on the train and how low a person can fall, wondering when would she reach her bottom."
2340,Mario,"The holes in your life are permanent. You have to grow around them, like tree roots around concrete; you mold yourself through the gaps.Okay, I get why all the hype.Now this is what I call a thriller. I haven't read a good mystery-thriller since I've read Gone Girl (and that was around 8 months ago), so I'm glad that changed.I've read somewhere that this was 'The Next Gone Girl', and I can't really agree with that. This wasn't as good as Gone Girl. But it was pretty damn close though.When it comes to story, I don't wanna give anything away, because I think you should go into this book not knowing anything. I'm just gonna say that the whole book was just so dark and twisted. From characters and plot to themes it dealt with (and trust me, this book dealt with some really important themes).If you're a fan of dark books with flawed and fucked up characters, I suggest giving this a go. Just try to go in it with low expectations (just like I did), because high expectations might ruin this book for you."
2341,Desi,"Aaand finally I've finished this book! In 2 days, eh? It got me hooked throughout, though I was a bit bored at the beginning. Rachel? Man, she's a complete mess and I HATE HER for not realizing that she's a mess!! A complete idiot who succumbed to alcohol. Yet, I was curious to see how she handled it as I felt that she had that will somehow to quit drinking, being such an idiot for drinking and messing her own life as well as others around her. She was hopeless...careless, depressed, down. Yet she's the one that got me hooked throughout this book. Hawkins is so brilliant in describing Rachel's depressions, internal pain and feelings. This book has opened more insights about what troubles people have to overcome everyday, that not everyone is perfect or has an awesome, happy life. That we could care more without interfering too much in others' troubles, help people that need it. That we should pay more attention to those around us in our life. Before everything is too late. I decided to give it five stars :). "
2342,Kathy Dillon,"I just finished this book last night. I couldn't put it down! In fact, I'm really sad that I finished it.The basic plot is this: a woman who turns out to be a very unreliable narrators takes the train back and forth to London every day. Every day, the train stops at a certain point and she's able to look into the lives of a couple who live along the tracks. She gives this couple names, a back story, everything. Then one day she sees the wife kissing another man ... and you know something bad is going to happen ....This is grim stuff - and it's especially harrowing if you've ever spent a night drinking and couldn't piece together the details of everything you did or said later on - but I absolutely loved it. Stop what you're doing and get this book now! "
2343,Weina,"This book is a jewel! The language is deceptively sophisticated, and the characters, all flawed and unlike-able to a certain point, were amazingly portrayed. I admire Hawkin's ability to see the world through their eyes, feel their ugly desires, and hear their selfish voices. It's terrifying, but wonderful!The hook is also well done, although I actually figured out who was the killer on page 50 and made a bet with my husband. Turned out I was right on the target. But it doesn't make the story lose any appeals. The plot twisted and turned, all the complications were timely thrown out, and readers faced many clues and questions related to the truth of the murder. Well done!Highly recommended! "
2344,Maria,Brilliant!
2345,Laura Angell,"I really enjoyed The Girl on the Train, it isn't my usual genre but I'm so glad I branched out for this one! As a commuter myself I spend a lot of my time looking out of the window into people's back gardens, and I think that's what makes this such a great novel - it's starts with such a mundane everyday task that every person can relate to but becomes so sinister. After finding out who the real killer was I felt like kicking myself because it seems so obvious and yet the novel was full of suspense that it wasn't an anticlimax. I absolutely loathed Anna, part of me was desperate for Rachel to just smack her smug, middle-class face, but in the end I think it was really symbolic that they joined forces - women can put aside their differences when massive tossers are involved. I would definitely recommend this book for anyone who wants a book so good they almost miss their stop on the train because they can't stop reading..."
2346,Sara Khorrami,"Oh my God... I just finished the book.. it was one of those books you can't put down.. i see how people compare it to (Gone girl ) but the events are faster, I have to admit that the main character was very boring and depressing at first but then i loved her.."
2347,Suad Shamma,"To say this book is gripping and you won't be able to put it down is an understatement. However, I will be the first to admit that this was nothing like I'd expected, not from the synopsis nor the reviews. I bought this book after witnessing all the hype surrounding it and the plot seemed very interesting, albeit a bit vague, enough for me to purchase it. I loved the idea of a girl on the same train every morning and evening, spying on people and creating whole lives for them in her head. I loved the idea of her witnessing something crazy and finding herself in the middle of a thrilling crime. What I didn't expect is that this girl is an irritating alcoholic, who brings nothing but trouble, who is obsessive, and who is honestly, just sickening to read about. I did not expect this girl, spying on people, to be actually spying on the neighborhood where she used to live with her husband Tom, who cheated on her and then left her for that woman. Tom, who now has a child with that woman and is living with his new family in their house. Rachel struck me as unstable with a load of mental issues. Her drinking problem really got on my nerves at one point, but Paula Hawkins still made me want to read on to find out what happened. One mysterious night, Rachel returns to the flat she's sharing with a friend bruised and bleeding. She blacks out, and wakes up the next morning not able to remember anything. All she knows is that the night before she had gotten off the train at the stop where she usually sees the couple she spies on, who she later finds out are called Megan and Scott, but everything after that is erased from her memory. She has an angry voice mail from her ex-husband asking her to leave them alone, that she's scaring his wife, Anna. She doesn't know what she's done this time, but is terrified due to the condition she woke up in. When she realizes that Megan has disappeared and the police are interrogating her about her whereabouts the night before, she is even more freaked out and becomes, if possible, even more obsessive. She makes it her mission to try and remember what happened that night and involves herself in everyone's lives, including that of Megan's husband and therapist. A lot of the times she makes things much worse, but sometimes, she comes close to piecing together the missing pieces. We are also given a glimpse into Megan and Anna's lives as they get to narrate their own chapters. We find out what Megan's life was really like with her husband and with her past, and we delve into Anna's insecurities and fears. I can't say I liked any of the characters, male or female. However, I found myself reading on until the very last page unable to pull myself away from the book. For that, I gave it 5 stars, because it takes real skill for an author to be able to suck me in this much despite my loathing for the characters. I can't say I expected more, but I did expect something completely different. "
2348,Kelly Hull,"Well, I've read it. And I know what all the fuss is about. This book was just plain fun to read. The ending left me wanting a bit more and I don't love the cover. But everything else? I devoured. It very much has the feel of Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn and Hawkins is every bit as talented as Flynn. There are three different viewpoints of three different women and the switching was never annoying. It only built suspense and kept me turning the pages. I actually sort of loved that our main character was terribly flawed. She is an alcoholic, which makes her a bit unreliable for her point of view, but that didn't bother me. I felt her pain. At times, it was written so well, I actually felt like I knew what it was like to be her. The pain is actually a joy to read. Sick? Maybe, but I just couldn't stop. "
2349,Virginia Anderson,"This was among those books I had seen mentioned so often I knew I needed to read it. I'm deep into it and believe I now know who the villain is. I have friends who argue that if you can identify the villain before the reveal, the book (or film) is somehow a failure. I don't think that's true at all. In this case, I find the tribulations and interactions of these sad people painfully compelling. If I had any quibbles, it would be that the whole scenario is just so sad. Such a hopeless picture of marriage and love (so far, at least). I'm hoping for something transcendent to emerge from the pain. I will check back in when I'm done.Done now! This was indeed a compelling read. It was quite classic in structure: Get characters in trouble, then get them deeper into trouble, and just when it looks as if things can't get worse, make sure they do. The pull of this plot structure is even stronger for me when the trouble is at least partly of the character's own making, as was Rachel's, so that turning trouble around requires growth and change. This engagement of characters with their predicaments is what moves me as a reader, and what I miss in puzzle mysteries: I never liked Agatha Christie's flat characters, for example. This book fully engaged me with Rachel, Megan, and Anna, even though sometimes I wanted to give each of them a (gentle) shake.As I write more and more reviews, I continue to note that I read as a writer, a practice that I think makes my responses somewhat different than they would be were I strictly a reader. An important scene late in the book spent many pages repeating what I already knew. Part of me said, ""Okay, I know all this, get on with it."" But the writer in me knew (from having been there) that climactic scenes require a certain weight. They have to take up a certain amount of space. And making readers wait is one way of building anticipation. The longer you wait (within certain largely indefinable limits, of course), the more you value the end when you get there. Similarly, at a crucial moment, I found myself wanting to shout, ""Why don't you do the obvious smart thing!"" But of course, if the character had done the obvious smart thing, the climactic scene itself would never have happened. Dullsville. And of course, if everybody always did the obvious smart thing all the time, there'd be no more stories, would there?So I forgive these writerly moves made in the service of story. This is a sad book about sad people, but it is also about a resilience that finally transcends the sadness. A very good read."
2350,Nora Giron-Dolce,"ExtraordinaryI simply could not put it down. This is an excellent work, all the characters are great, well drawn. Loved it"
2351,Shetal,"Read via Audible. This was a great book. The plot was intriguing and the the story held my interest from beginning to end. Highly recommend for book clubs. Warning, the ending is pretty fu#%* up, but WAY better than the ending of Gone Girl (which made me want to pull out my hair and cry over wasting hours of my life reading that damn book). "
2352,Morgan,"This book read like a movie. The characters, settings, and scenes were so vivid - I could barely put it down. I developed several incorrect theories throughout and fell happily for more than one red herring. Well played, Paula. I hope you keep writing thrillers."
2353,Amanda Bridgeman,This was a fabulous read that had me hooked from page one. I listened to the audiobook and thought the three narrators did a great job. Quite possibly my favourite read of the year!
2354,Karly,"5/5 starsI loved this - so much so that I read it in two days! This book was right up my ally. I enjoy suspense, mystery, and messed up characters more than any other genre.Where to begin? The characters were fantastic. As cuckoo as Rachel and Megan were, I could empathize with both of them. I'll never understand why alcohol is so revered when it can cause so much damage - it's an addictive drug, no matter what the companies who produce it say. Rachel truly needed someone to step in and help her. Everyone in her life was enabling her in one way or another. I'm glad she pulled herself together in the end - I knew she had it in her. I felt as though I could relate to Megan the most. Not because of the cheating (I could never condone that), but because of how stifled she felt as a housewife. I think I would feel the same way. I've never wanted that - the house with the white-picket fence scenario. I think it would drive me a little crazy too.Tom fooled me for the first half or so of the book. I felt slightly sorry for him, because even though he royally messed up, no one deserves a stalker. But then I started to see how he was enabling Rachel - stringing her along. I've known manipulative people, and it's so hard to see through it. Tom was an expert at it, and luckily he got what was coming to him.I loathed Anna. She's the perfect example of the type of person I can't stand - so completely and utterly self absorbed, and convinced that everyone's world should revolve around her child because hers does. Just thinking about her now makes my blood boil.Scott was meh for me. I wanted to feel bad for him, but he was a violent brute so, yeah, meh.The pacing and the plot were great. I couldn't put it down - I read it at my desk at work, while sitting in the car, everywhere. I enjoyed the different viewpoints and liked that it was kept to the three female characters.I would highly recommend this book for anyone who is a fan of suspenseful thrillers."
2355,Cathe Olson,"Rachel is a divorced, alcoholic woman who continues to take her commuter train to and from the city even after she is fired from her job. She secretly covets the life of a husband and wife whom she spies every day from the train. When the wife disappears, Rachel thinks something she saw might help solve the case, but when she comes forward, she gets more involved than she had bargained for. Told from the alternating points of views of three women, this psychological thriller is a real page turner. Loved it!"
2356,Sbeam,"Wow, some really screwed up people in this one. You just never know about people do you?"
2357,Carla Palmeiro,"And here it goes, yet another book being labelled the next Gone Girl…This is compulsory reading for sure; from page one I simply could not stop reading it. It is that good in my opinion, and to know now that it is the author’s first book makes me even more impressed. I’m even more awe-struck by this book than I was last year by another debut, The Good Girl by Mary Kubica, a book that I highly recommended but know that it was not consensual. There was so twists and turns that my head kept spinning and spinning the entire time. I ended suspecting every single character to be the culprit and no, this time I only realized the WHO and WHY when it was almost too obvious. Everything made sense to me, nothing felt too predictable nor forced which is kind of rare this days.So for once believe the hype, this is amazing storytelling, cannot stop reading kind of thriller, suspenseful and exhilarating until the very end. If you like Gillian Flynn and need your next Gone Girl fix look no further. "
2358,Tahlia,I loved this book. The characters felt so real. The writing was incredible. I loved all of the twists and I wasn't sure at all what was going to happen but it was wonderful! Best thriller I've read in a while.
2359,Julia ,"Creepy, mysterious, fast-paced. Definitely recommend to fans of Gillian Flynn or just good books in general. "
2360,Cattie,"I looked forward to read ""The Girl on the Train"", the debut novel by Paula Hawkins and I was not disappointed at all.Story:Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning. Every day she rattles down the track, flashes past a stretch of cozy suburban homes, and stops at the signal that allows her to daily watch the same couple breakfasting on their deck. She’s even started to feel like she knows them. “Jess and Jason,” she calls them. Their life—as she sees it—is perfect. Not unlike the life she recently lost.And then she sees something shocking. It’s only a minute until the train moves on, but it’s enough. Now everything’s changed. Unable to keep it to herself, Rachel offers what she knows to the police, and becomes inextricably entwined in what happens next, as well as in the lives of everyone involved. Has she done more harm than good?Rachel is a complex and interesting character and one that is more realistic than many others. She is an alcoholic who isn't able to get over the fact that her ex-husband has left her 2 years ago and now lives with his new wife and a daughter in the house the two of lived in when they were married.I don't want to justify Rachel's drinking problem, but I understand that it must have been really hard for her to see her ex-husband happy with the woman he cheated on her with. And that he still lives in the house the bought together, probably still sleeps in the same bed, but with another woman by his side, this must be difficult for Rachel to deal with.I read somewhere, that the story is similar to Gillian Flynn's successful novel Gone Girl, but it only has a couple of similarities.The woman Rachel has called Jess is missing, just a day after Rachel saw something from the train that shocked her.The police suspects the husband, but he seems innocent.That's like the only thing this book has in common with Rachel, if you leave the fact out that none of the characters turns out to be how he or she seems.The plot twists were unexpected, the characters changed visible and because of realistic reasons and I liked the portrayal of a broken woman looked for a sense in life.The differing points of view were also nice and entertaining. I especially liked that the name of the person from whose perspective the chapter was, stood as a reminder on each page.I give 5 of 5 trains for this book. When I think about it, the solution was obvious, but Hawkins has written such a good story around it that made me forget about this."
