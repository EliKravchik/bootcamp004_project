"1",0,"Ian Nelk","The only downside of this book is that people think this is what Hunter S. was like all the time, when in fact he was not as much of a drug-addict as the book lets on. He was a raging alcoholic, and that's way better."
"2",1,"Andreas","It was the year of 1971 when Hunter S. Thompson were going to cover a race for money he had already blown on a borrowed convertible and enough drugs to kill a military squad. Going through the adventure of a lifetime he makes a satire of what cops ""know"" about drugs, the American dream, and The United States during the 70's in a drug-filled state of mind filled with hypocrisy and paranoid delusions. From page one this book gripped me with a bold start in a car heading down a desert highway on the way to Las Vegas using several drugs at the same time. The characters are well established and the plot is as exiting as a drug filled ride through the Nevada desert. It's also a great example of Gonzo journalism, my favorite kind. In conclusion it's an honest look at drugs and the paranoid dilutions that follows. A recommended read for liberal minds prepared for a ride through the dead American dream. Rest in piece Hunter S. Thompson. You will be remembered fondly. "
"3",2,"Leah","Hunter S. Thompson's personality type is of the kind I define as ""lovable asshole"" - light on the lovable. Thompson's drug induced rants slide from colorful to bashful to brash to beastial to bland to caustic and back again. After first reading Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas I assumed that he was not actually personified in his books, but that he was possibly grossly exagerating his view of himself. After reading a larger body of his work over the last fifteen years, including biographical works, he appears by all accounts to be very much the insane coke snorting, gun toting, raving lunatic of a ""gonzo"" journalist oscilating between sycophantic, manipulative, and uabashedly irreverent behaviour that is painted so vividly in many of his books. As a high school student I loved the LSD and other drug references. In the last few years I have read some of his more recent works and the drugs certainly hurt any cohesive quality of his writing that may have been apparent in his early years. There is certainly and decidedly a place in history and on my shelves for an author such as Hunter S. Thompson. To me he is a symbol of the arrogance of youth and the arrogance of the self proclaimed damned. His contribution was great. I will save my collection for future generations. "
"4",3,"Jessica W","Was going over gifts for the holidays and had to review this book and say how awesome it is. Very funny, entertaining, and amazingly thought provoking. Highly (pun intended) recommended. "
"5",4,"Syfy","What can I say? It's Hunter S Thompson."
"6",5,"KATEtheGREATESTBESTONE","i love this book. love love love. one day i will go to vegas."
"8",7,"Nelsonatevoflux","One of the best, funniest, and most enjoyable rides of a book I was ever taken on."
"11",10,"Zac Stojcevski","It took 70 pages for the spider's web of creativity to kick into a coherent story for me. A faster pace than Kerouac's On the Road and more warped and contemporary than Burroughs' Junky this quick and pleasant read is an ideal journey book read mainly on a plane; regular top ups to not be dry. Ralph Steadman's cartoons provide a visual distraction - artwork in their own right. Looking forward to reading more Hunter S Thompson soon."
"12",11,"Julie Mercer","LOVED IT!"
"15",14,"Arcoxson","I have probably read this book 10 times and laugh out loud every time. A must read for everyone."
"18",17,"Anne Thessen","The bats are my favorite part."
"20",19,"Maureen","Dr. Hunter S. Thompson, may he rest in peace (or raise hell perpetually if he so chooses), has got to be one of the most brilliant commentators on American society who ever lived. If I could only keep one of his books, this one would be it. I spent six months in Las Vegas once, doing community interviews for the Howard Hughes Mormon will trial case. I found Las Vegas to be every bit as bizarre as it is portrayed in this book. If I had had his lawyers, guns and money, my sojourn would have been complete. ""As your attorney, I advise you to"" read this book immediately if you have not already done so."
"22",21,"Stefan Zaharievski","Amazing book, explaining the life of a american journalist in a way that immerses you in his world and makes you wonder. How? How do some people do it. Good read."
"23",22,"Michael Aaron","If you only read one book from this period in history, make it this one. But it's far more than a historic monument to failure - it's funny, it's witty, inventive, and true in the way only classic fiction can be. Just read it and understand why America lost its way in the 60's and is still trying to find a new path."
"26",25,"Jordan Bradford"," Gonzo journalism at its finest. Either you'll love it, or be repulsed by it, but like they said about the Grateful Dead: Hunter S. Thompson isn't the best at what he did, he's the only one who did what he did."
"27",26,"Thomas","It's worth reading just for the sake of reading it. You don't want to be one of the 10 people who haven't do you?"
"28",27,"Mahala","Finished in two days. Went through a period of screaming 'what are you DOING?' at the book, and then 'oh my God! Oh my GOD, what's WRONG with you??' (despite the obvious answer) and finally, around the bit with the tape recordings, sank back into a fog of denial and decided to pretend the whole thing was totally made up. Some of it is bound to be fictional. Seriously, do I even know how to read books anymore? I am such a sheltered person. I should be more adventurous, if only to avoid the severe shock. To be fair, I can't tell if this book was the most real or most unreal book I have ever read. But I am buzzed with it, and I'd like more, please. Maybe in another month or so."
"29",28,"Kristina Kauffman","Classic. Everyone's seen the movie. Read the book. "
"30",29,"Lauren Mccarthy","Awesome read..."
"31",30,"Kim Maltempo","""Buy the ticket, take the ride""..........what more do I really have to say?READ IT."
"33",32,"Sandi","Pretty silly, but a lot of fun to read."
"34",33,"Rick Zhu","Fear and Loathing is a ridiculous, over-the-top and downright fantastic book. The book is slick, extremely fast-paced and laugh-out-loud hilarious - it's like being on something just reading it! The book slows down as the drugs change when Raoul and his attorney arrive on the strip to check into their hotel room and everything gets properly trippy. To someone hung up on the countless drug-references, I'd say it's pretty evenly pro-drugs and anti - the good trips read hilariously with the protagonists dashing from one out-of-their-minds experience to the next however the bad trips (complete with hideously-detailed explanations) are painful to read about and enough to put any but the most hardened drug-takers from giving it a try. Most of the book does sound fun though... Put simply, I loved this book and was gutted to see it finish."
"35",34,"Matthew Tracy","The prose Thompson uses to describe his thoughts while under the influence of drugs had me captivated; many of his experiences were both funny and interesting to read about. All the same, a bizarre read with no counterpart."
"38",37,"Sean Puig","Funniest book I've ever read."
"39",38,"Matthew Morris","The American dream; sweaty, strung out, fever pitched, lost and gathering directions from a drive thru at some unknown hour with confusion about paradise."
"40",39,"Cpttrips","Loved this book"
"43",42,"Huda ""The Reading Beast""","It was funny and interesting. I learned a lot about mescaline. haha"
"45",44,"Sam K.","Excellent, 100% excellence. "
"47",46,"Prakash Yadav","A Doctor of Journalism and an Attorney in Law rip the Strip laced with an alphabet soup of drugs, its the most sinister trip you will ever have sober. Humourous in its own ways. The movie adaptation does not deviate much from the book, moreover, Johnny Depp brings whole another dimension to Duke, pretty much explains why I have a poster on this movie on my wall. Will read again!"
"48",47,"Nicholas Schutz","This is a classic it's a must read for any HST fan."
"49",48,"David Turko","read this entire book in one sitting, which is unheard of for me. I love the crazy story and the chaotic characters in it. "
"50",49,"Tommy G","This book is classic Hunter!"
"52",51,"MIke","Honestly what can anyone say about this book that hasn't already been said by someone else, not the least of which is the writing itself. What should have been stagnant, limp-wristed journalism's death-knell is instead now just a livid, fevered, vitriolic and sadly poetic look back on the crushing tide that swept away the 60's and its version of the American Dream."
"53",52,"Ali Shahandeh","The great thing about “Fear and…” is; unlike many books; do not invest on dramatic events to hold on to its audience (that’s why the movie was so crappy) but clever monologue and sharp observation rendering through brilliant style of witting, totally make up for it. Who does not love a sentence like this: “The room looked like the site of some disastrous zoological experiment involving whiskey and gorillas”. It is terrifyingly fantastic."
"55",54,"Rachel Troupe","Very good"
"56",55,"Tom Rugg","Insanely funny, with completely outlandish characters walking amongst the rest of normal society. Even if it isn't 100% non-fiction (as purported), it is still a great story! "
"58",57,"Laurens Bosscher","Very entertaining and intresting read I really got sucked in to the 60/70ties feeling and the awesome bender that Thompson must have experienced. This book (and knowing the context about the book) gives a new perspective on the equally awesome movie!"
"59",58,"Shibby78787","good book the wave speech is my favoriot part"
"60",59,"Ed Holden","As your lawyer, I recommend you read this book, which is actually a piece of investigative journalism masquerading as a psychedelic novel."
"62",61,"Jes","Great trip!"
"64",63,"Ben Smith","My favorite book of all time, made even more important to me because my father gave me the book. Not the typical book your father would recommend."
"66",65,"Aimée Hancock","laughing in pain for too long"
"67",66,"William Sadowski","A strange jaunt on a routine assignment to cover a bike race in Las Vegas becomes a legendary romp through sin city as lived by Hunter S. Thompson. What would have been a half remembered drug induced rant by anyone else, becomes a great work of literature penned by this famous gonzo journalist. The illicit drug use and strange happenings that this man and his attorney document are among the strangest ever to be recorded, and easily blur the line between fact and fiction. It brings to life a time that many believe was the last great revolution in this country, or at least that is what many thought it was."
"68",67,"Seth T."," This Hunter S. Thompson at effusive best. The book is as frenzied as his topic and Thompson has a gift for description unlike anything seen since the glory of Raymond Chandler.p.s. it helps if you imagine Johnny Depp narrating. "
"70",69,"Todd Swafford","Wild and Crazy, as expected. Hunter has some kind of subtle truth about him, and when it hits, It's like a brick wall."
"71",70,"Zellain Dystopia","I thought this book was hilarious. Loved the illustrations. Don't try to make sense of it though."
"72",71,"Johanna","LOVED it! Hated the movie though."
"73",72,"Chasity","I learned that Hunter S. Thompson was a crazy, brilliant man. This book provides endless entertainment and at times makes you think you're a little crazy. "
"75",74,"Bill Sullivan","can't help it,I like HST"
"77",76,"Louis LeBlanc","Somewhere near Barstow, at thee edge of the desert, the drugs began to take effect.One of the greatest opening lines ever written."
"80",79,"A.J.","Hunter Thompson originally wanted to be a novelist, but (according to many biographers) he lacked the self-confidence to follow it through. Given the relatively option of writing whatever came into his head (and rewriting well-worn gonzo-isms), he chose the easy option in his later career rather than choosing to work on fiction. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas remains his best work, and a glimpse of what might have been, had he stuck to fiction.For this is fiction. On close reading, it's far too carefully written to be a straight, non-fictional account -- and what's more, the facts of his Vegas trips, revealed in his letters and elsewhere, contradict the book. Does anyone believe, for example, that they really picked up a hitch-hiker on the way, just in time for a little necessary exposition? It's too good a fit; the hitch-hiker was invented to allow him to lay out the backstory.The most forgettable passages in the book, as it happens, are the passages where Thompson returns to his non-fictional purpose. For example, his discussion of the DA's convention on narcotics and dangerous drugs breaks the flow of the narrative and is of merely historical interest -- but the chapter that is supposedly reconstructed directly from his tape recordings remains relevant. It's the fictional aspects of the book that give it lasting interest. If only Thompson had followed up on this success, he would have left a much different legacy."
"86",85,"Dimitri","Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a wild story about a drug feuled journey from Los Angeles to Las Vegas to cover the Mint 400 race. Hunter S. Thompson and his lawyer start off their adventure on the road to Las Vegas in a large red convertible with a trunk full of various drugs and alcohol. Mid way through the trip the two men stop to take a number of different drugs. Shortly thereafter, when the drugs hit the men they both begin to hallucinate. Thompson quickly finds himself in a state of paranoia that rarely sunsides for the rest of the story. He feels threatened by everyone he sees and he is always worried about people realizing that he is tripping out on drugs. Even after Thompson and his lawyer wreck their car, destroy their hotel room and nearly shoot eachother multiple times they still manage to achieve the ""American Dream.""Hunter S. Thompson uses the this chaotic story to share his feelings about human nature, the ""American Dream"" and the society that we live in. I really enjoyed the vivid narration in the stroy and the way that Thompson paints a picture of the wild hallucinations and situations he finds himself in. The book definitely helped me research about our subconscious mind because so much of the story consists of Thompson and his lawyer either hallucinating, being paranoid or dealing with some kind of moral dilemma as they try to keep a grasp on all the wild situations they find themselves in. I think that the chaos in the book speaks for the chaos in our society and I really enjoyed how Hunter Thompson painted that picture through his story."
"87",86,"Stephen Naish","Read this book for what might have been the 10th time in my life. It never fails to amaze me. "
"88",87,"Cathy aka The Attached Mama","I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. I think I'm getting the Fear. "
"89",88,"Teacher JD","Hysterical crazy journey with Hunter S. Thompson, who probably didn't know that he was creating an entirely new way of writing. Absolutely amazing. Just re-read it recently, and it still brought laughter and tears out of me. "
"90",89,"Andrew Whitaker","I fucking love this guy"
"91",90,"Dean liapis","Rereading a lot of books lately, picked this up to read to kill 15 minutes, then read it all the way through again. Excellent writing as usual from Thompson, narrating his drug fueled frenzy in Las Vegas. This is probably my favorite of all his ""fear and loathing"" titles. "
"93",92,"Corey Ro","A hell of a Gonzo ride in ""Search for the American Dream"" sent out to cover the Mint 500 in Las Vegas true to Gonzo style Thompson injects himself into the story this type of POV journalism is pretty much Gonzo to a T. From the frantic race to gather gear, to the long road from LA to Vegas to the Hotel. Its a drug induced acid trip of a tale. In the end only covering a fraction of the Mint 500 while his editor is constantly badgering him for a story. Trashing hotel rooms, prostitutes, pretty much raising hell all over, From the Strip to the Highway. Probably known as his most popular ""novel"" we know that at least some percentage of this is actually factual. Thompson even goes as far as to change his name to Raul Duke for fear of prosecution from the debauchery that occurs while searching for the American dream. Its a head trip of a story, with moments of extreme clarity where he realizes that the days of the love and freedom movement are fading off. YOu've most likely seen the movie already, Give the book a read, there's a lot more that went on and its a little less ""Mr. Toads Wild Ride"" and more Gonzo."
"94",93,"Kerrycapp","The classic."
"96",95,"Ralph","Very entertaining and much better than the movie"
"97",96,"Jerry","Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas has the best opening line of any book since “A Tale of Two Cities”:We were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when the drugs began to take hold. I remember saying something like “I feel a bit lightheaded; maybe you should drive...” And suddenly there was a terrible roar all around us and the sky was full of what looked like huge bats, all swooping and screeching and diving around the car, which was going about a hundred miles an hour with the top down to Las Vegas. And a voice was screaming: “Holy Jesus! What are these goddamn animals?”Perhaps the purest of Thompson’s searches for the American Dream because it is untainted by politics; or perhaps the most pointless for the same reason, as politics have tainted the American Dream since the Adams anti-sedition acts almost as soon as the country was born.This was Thompson’s first book-length team-up with illustrator Ralph Steadman, whose images do as much as to define gonzo as Thompson’s ravings do. This is the most manic of Thompson’s books. You’ve probably already heard the drugs quote, right from the start, and rather than set the tone, it seems pedestrian once they get to the underage girl from Montana and the American Dream itself."
"98",97,"Kellen Quigley","It was fun!"
"100",99,"Garion Bracken","One of the most interestingly written books I've read. Just because of the style. Sometimes a story is compelling, sometimes it's relevant. Sometimes the language is just superb. I think H.S. hits all these marks in with decent scores but personally it's the language that does it for me with this. Which is why it's unsurprising that so much of the book is directly used for the script of the movie."
"101",100,"Lora","One of my favorite books ever. I need to read it again....I remember literally laughing out loud when I read it the first time."
"102",101,"Bunny","This?Is my American Dream."
"104",103,"Nikki Plummer","This was probably my favourite book that I’ve read this year, I know I’ll read it again. I don’t really feel qualified to express how great this book is, it’s just funny, and clever, and awesome. I love it, and I think Thompson is a crazy genius."
"105",104,"Zahava222","When I was young I was not much of a reader then in College I had a cool teacher tell me to read this book. It changed my life as I was taken on a crazy drug addled adventure. I never knew I could be propelled through a book like being shot out of a cannon. "
"107",106,"Joshua Johnson","Great, hilarious, true HST form. "
"108",107,"Nicholas Kilmer","The story of a confused, drug addled man searching for The American Dream while covering the story of the Mint 400 in Las Vegas. This book is beautiful in every way. Pure Gonzo journalism. The ""wave speech"" is my favorite to read. I'm also a huge fan of the movie. "
"113",112,"Gretchen","Hunter S. Thompson writes like, well like he is. It’s wild, unpredictable, clever, witty and sticks with you. He writes amazing and pointless odyssey across Las Vegas on various mind-altering substances. Thompson knows how to write and Fear and Loathing shows a good use of the language."
"115",114,"Luke Cummins","Ah this was fucking brilliant! I laughed all the way through, and I love that the moral of the story is 'You should probably do drugs.' It's probably like, designed for a specific target audience that can appreciate killing hitch hikers and drug fuelled insanity but alas, it's great! "
"118",117,"scrillllaaa","hilarious. but the ending kind of sucks i dont really get it. props for doing all those drugs though, and surviving haha i couldn't do it."
"119",118,"Thescribblinggenius","Amazing book. The prose is so wonderful that I felt like I was with Thompson through every second of his drug-induced haze."
"120",119,"Joey LaBartunek","Hunter S Thompson is one of my personal heroes, a man who forged a path straight through the dark parts of America and the soul and stayed true to himself. This is the well known tale of Thompson's journeys in and around the city of sin while demolishing himself with every foreign substance known to man. No one described the sheer chaos of the trip like Hunter. He got the people, the city, the drugs, the madness, and the sheer idiotic poetry of it all. "
"121",120,"Seth Madej","Contains possibly my all-time favorite first page."
"124",123,"Marius van Blerck","Not quite sure how to describe this all-time classic, so I won’t. Suffice to say that you shouldn’t miss it! I also listened to the audiobook version, and the narrator, Ron McLarty, hits the spot exactly. There’s nothing, simply nothing, about this book that could be improved."
"125",124,"Huw Evans","The fact that Hunter S Thompson lived as long as he did is nothing short of a miracle. The king of Gonzo journalism was a graduate of the drug culture, summa cum laude, and his writing is an absurd combination of inebriated hallucination and anger at the direction that the USA appeared to be taking. As a Welshman it was more difficult for me to become involved with his political writing (e.g. F&L on the Campaign Trail which was written when I was too young to vote or be interested in politics)but his outrageous journeys, accompanied by Ralph Steadman, are works of dysfunctional genius."
"126",125,"Carlos","It was a whole bunch of fun. Sublimely written, so visceral at times. You are just right fucking there. Had a great ass time with this one."
"127",126,"Katherine Dennihy","A book I can read over and over again."
"128",127,"Kathryn Peterson","Almost too much, but really just enough."
"130",129,"Ali","i fucking love this book. it's been a few years, but i used to read it over and over- it cracks me up every time."
"133",132,"Jessie B.","This has to be one of my favorite books. I did see the movie first, but the books stands on it's own merits and is a good introduction to the strange and fascinating person who is Hunter S. Thompson."
"140",139,"B.T. Hogan","Buy the ticket, take the ride.This book is above reviews by anyone anywhere. Just read it. If you don't like or get it, that's on you. "
"143",142,"Matthew Richmond","One of the greatest books I have ever read. There's not much else I can say, that hasn't already been written. Hunter Thompson is a literary genius. "
"145",144,"W.T.","""We were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when the drugs began to take hold."" I was just telling someone how that might very well be the greatest opening to any story written. How is it possible to grab the reader by the gullet and make them want to see when these two drug addled journeymen in any greater way?"
"147",146,"Margaret Carmel","I'm going to preface this review with the fact that i've neither done drugs or been to Las Vegas. BUT, I feel like this book took me as close as I can get without actually visiting Sin City. There's so no plot and no character development, but I got completely sucked into this story about a journalist and his attorney who travel to Las Vegas to cover a bike race and a Drug Convention. It's part brilliant writing, part hilarious drug addled antics and black comedy, and part meditation on the end of the 1960s and the demise of the counterculture movement. In this book, Thompson was able to perfectly capture a seminal moment in American history. What did the massive movements of the decade of free love mean exactly? In this work, the characters are struggling with the idea that the underground world of sex, drugs, and rock and roll that had arisen in places like San Francisco might not have actually changed the world. In their search for the American Dream, they find it instead replaced by insane capitalistic pursuits and limitations on their expression. Hunter S. Thompson was an amazing writer and i'm completely amazed how he was able to take a book about drugs and use it to express the anxieties of twilight of the 1960s. My attorney advises you to read this book. "
"148",147,"Kelsey","Possibly my favourite book. It is hilarious and amazingly written. I wish Hunter S. Thompson wrote more books in this format."
"149",148,"Drew","One of my favorite books of all time. Hunter S. Thompson mixes drugs with alliteration... a must-read."
"150",149,"Erico Cazarré","Realmente é melhor que o filme. E olha que o filme é do caralho!"
"154",153,"Susannah Prewitt","Hunter S. Thompson, one of the best. READ THIS BOOK."
"155",154,"Vigneshwar Jaiprakash","Hunter at his venomus best. Watch the movie and then catch the documentary 'Buy the ticket, take the ride. "
"156",155,"Audrey Greathouse","The best book ever written about the drug culture of the love generation, and the transitional insanity of the 60s and 70s. Side-splitting stories and spellbinding prose that will make you question how much the human condition changes and is shaped by its culture, generation to generation."
"157",156,"Stephen Herfst","I loved this book. The combinations of disconnected words and sounds tickle my brain in ways no other author can. Hunter brings a comical acid-tripping perspective to a junket tour in Las Vegas where you are constantly questioning whether the words he writes down are the truth, a combination of the drugs he takes or outright lies. In all honesty, it doesn't matter, so just settle back and enjoy the journey while Hunter and his Lawyer (of questionable ethnicity) throw caution and the Nevada state laws to the wind."
"159",158,"Lars Martin","A brilliant read. Brilliant, shocking, outrageous and funny. That should cover it."
"160",159,"Evo Popoff","It's a blast. "

"169",168,"Dave Dick","Fantastic...very very funny...the book I have most commonly given away..."
"170",169,"Alex Brinson","Holy shit! Maybe my favorite book ever."
"173",172,"Mikkel","Gonzo at it´s best and brightest. Thompson takes the genre to it´s limits, blurring the lines between fact and fiction, while the heart of the American Dream moves ever closer."
"174",173,"Duncan","Come on, you can read it in 3 hours and you'll be laughing hard for 2 of them."
"177",176,"Loren Toddy","Actually read this book before this film and I was glad I did. Wow, I have never encountered a book like this ever. It changed books for me forever. I ate up every page of this book, every damn page and loved it."

"191",190,"Liam Jennings","Unlike anything you've ever read and sadly unlike anything you'll ever read again. "
"193",192,"Melody","Absolutely Amazing"
"194",193,"Mickey","Thompson is known as having a completely effed-up and drug-addled view of the world around him. I call it truth and it's absolutely hilarious. The man was a complete deviant and an incredible writer."

"199",198,"Frank Pentimone","Funny shit, the Hunter S Thompson story is great, this book is nothing less then the American Dream, he is one of gods own prototypes to crazy to Live too rare to Die. They also made a movie out of this afterward and Benitio Del Torro and john Depp were robbed of Oscars. Later Hunter would blow his own head off in a suicide at age 80. WTF!"
"200",199,"Johnny Malloy","This is the only book I have ever read where I viewed the experience as visceral. Wild, without thought, yet perfectly written, probably a freak of nature, this book is what I strive to someday write.Plus, having Johnny Depp's voice in your head as your read it, I admit, helps."
"201",200,"Chaz","I give this book an Epic rating of... 100%"
"203",202,"Bridget","pretty much one of my favourite things ever, it has inspired me to start my own hunteresque roadtrip just as soon as i sort out a sweet ride and helpful attorney. "

"222",221,"Meghan Chiampa","This goes down in my list of lists as the funniest book i've ever read. as a hippie stoner, it was very hard to avoid watching this movie until I read the book. even if you've never taken acid, i think it would still be hilarious. HST was a genius. "
"223",222,"Book_lover","The original gonzo journalist. Makes you want to be at his side."
"224",223,"Natasha","I love this author!!!! love his writing style. Come'on it's Hunter S. Thompson people!!!! "
"225",224,"Chloe","i think this book gets a bad rep because when people read it, they think of it as ""oh, that's just a druggy book."" i actually had someone tell me ""you only like that book because it's a drug book."" well, maybe they're right. i never really thought of it. yeah, i can relate to this book because of the drugs mentioned in it. however, how can THAT make it a ""bad book""? i mean, really. it's well written. seriously...it's brilliant, if you ask me. the topics that hunter s. thompson choose may be a little wild, crazy, ""out there,"" but the writting is enough to make it a brilliant book, again....in my opinion. anyway, if you couldn't tell... i enjoyed the book. i think if you like reading about the things most people are scared to write about or afraid to admit to themselves muchless anyone else..read it."
"230",229,"Eileen","I loved/love this book. "
"231",230,"N.K.","There is a reason that this book is considered a classic in American literature. The subject matter might turn off a few but read it for the writing and the story-telling. Hunter Thompson was and remains a pillar in American letters. Funny, funny book. The one that established him as a tremendous talent. But as others have said, there are other pieces that really cement what was started here. "
"233",232,"Rhonda","A rollicking and incredibly well written read jam-packed with astute witticisms. Hats off to Hunter S. Thompson."
"234",233,"David Meza","Classic Thompson."
"236",235,"Holli","Fun, fun, fun read. "
"237",236,"Angela","awesome"
"238",237,"Mara Evans","I read this to Dad on our Father/Daughter trip through the desert and Las Vegas. We loved it. Laughed a lot. You have to be cool with an underground culture to find the humor in it otherwise you might not appreciate the characters or their behavior. AKA if you're a prude or easily offended, skip it. But if you're either of those, you probably don't even know who Thompson is."
"239",238,"Maddie","Fucking crazy, disjointed, everything I'd like to write."
"241",240,"Gert","even more fun reading at a second time :) very entertaining. slightly sad though it's finished now :s"
"243",242,"Kat Connors","Hands down one of my favorite books of all time. If you liked the movie, you'll LOVE the book. The movie is by far the truest adaptation of a book I have ever seen. 90% is verbatim. Mahalo. "
"245",244,"Christian","If Hell's Angels was the foreplay, Fear and Loathing is the orgasm. Required reading!"
"246",245,"Linwood","if your'e an american, you'll read this book. best read while in a pick up truck, traveling through the bible belt. dont burn the locals."
"247",246,"Nick Davis","Thompson makes me actually laugh out loud while I'm reading this ridiculous story. But deeper down, the story is one that explores the reality of ""the American Dream"" in context to the crazy adventure the two characters have in vegas. With as much excitement as they encounter, how can anyone really want to settle down in suburban America with a spouse, two-and-a-half children, a dog, and a picket fense? ""Do they pay you to fuck that polar bear?"""
"248",247,"H Wesselius","a must read when one is young enough to be inspired."
"249",248,"Myron","More awesome than anyone could possibly put into words. The movie comes really close to doing this book justice but, if you really want to experience it, you need to read it."
"251",250,"Brendan","This is one of my favorite books. Thompson's take on the ""American Dream"" is unlike any other book I have read. A mix between political comentary, fantasy and satire, his story is great. You'll want to read it more than once."
"252",251,"Ash","This is one of my favorite books, hands down. Thompson displays an amazing balance of trippy, thrill, and humor. I would recommend this to anyone who was looking for something wildly different and fun."
"254",253,"Margaret Breidenbaugh","It surprised me that I couldn't put this book down. I would definitely read it again. The story is not about doing drugs. There is a larger theme at play."
"257",256,"Emily Wickline","this book is a classic. a schizophrenic, frantic, drug-fueled journalistic account of ""who gives a fuck"""
"258",257,"Alejandro  Sosa","More a personal thing; my love for this book, and the timing of when I read it you see. It just edges or may tie with William Gaddis' Jr for a novel that influenced me as an Artist and writer, more so. In the sense that I understand it can omit this smell of a cacophony of hyperbole. But I truly relate from the perspective of understanding Thompson's aim to communicate a mood or ambiance. Whether you think this is a good book or not, is a discussion I had with a friend actually, who saw an O'Brien or Joyce more befitting of its lofty place in my opinion of books. I'm humble in this and see this as pioneering, even though many say it wasn't even his best work, it is for me the more visceral Artist within me that just looks at this work as a true masterpiece. So in a sense, and for a few other reasons, Thompson is one of the main reasons I started to write, and into the future I'll openly admit this. I love this book because it has an ambiance and it is on the cusp of what the narrative form can do. I just love imagination, more than let's say a DFW, who's work has imagination, but it's execution for me, as I continue reading Infinte Jest now (a happening for years), is just overly verbatim. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is all mood, all popular culture, but for me, popular culture at it's most transcendent, funny and best. Will people disagree if I placed it in a top ten of books? I can hear the barbed comments now. But maybe it's just the rock star in me...meh..."
"260",259,"Paige","Fun but obnoxious. I didn't expect it to make me feel such pity."
"262",261,"Tvshi","I am not HST's biggest fan -- that's my sister -- but I remember reading this on a single airplane trip and feeling like I was on an acid high the entire time. Truly transporting."
"263",262,"Kari","Fast paced, disturbing, hilarious and strange all at the same time! Also it is one of the rare occasions where the film stayed fairly true to the book which is always a nice bonus. "
"264",263,"Stephen Osika","Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, by Hunter S. Thompson, is a book with a very unique ""feel"" to it. The plot follow's the surrealistic journey of a journalist and his lawyer, on their way to cover a story about an auto-race in the Nevada desert. The book has a particularly strong focus on the two main characters' psychological/emotion instability, and their copious drug consumption. The tone of the book's narration is eclectic. The narrator's voice is deranged, sloppy, and hyper, while still retaining a certain level of introspectiveness. In combination, these qualities reflect the mind of the book's central character in a very panoramic way. The acid-fueled perspective of Raoul Duke paints a vivid picture of the counter-culture movement, as well as it's casualties. The author's descriptions are mainly based in Duke's substance-induced delusions, fears, and observations. It's what I would call an ""extreme perspective"", in terms of how subjective it is. This isn't something I've come across often in novels, and I've never read a book that was able to incorporate that idea so effectively and humorously. I think the idea of narrating a book from the perspective of a chronic, heavy drug-user is quite interesting. It allows the writer to blur the boundaries of reality and fantasy within the book, and transform the mundane into the absurd. This is what makes Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas a truly good book; Thompson's ability to be reflective, ridiculous, obscene and serious, sometimes all at once. "
"267",266,"Billie Alfrey","Confusing... But brilliant."
"268",267,"Jimmy Baumgardner","As your attorney I advise you to read this book"
"271",270,"J. Miller","Recommended for anyone that loves journalism and/or drugs. 5.3/5 drops of Adrenochrome."
"272",271,"Ryan Elmore","Drug-fuelled, totally depraved and worth every second."
"273",272,"Rupert","When I first read this in my late teens it completely blew my mind. Especially since I'm paranoid without psychotropics. America can be completely terrifying in even the most banal circumstances and Hunter always nails it. Of course this helped fuel many sloppy drunken road trips that luckily didn't end in any deaths."
"274",273,"Chris Roberts","A great book that really marks the importance of satire, and how it can make the depressive world we live in so very funny."
"278",277,"RK Byers","In the words of the great Rakim ""this is how it should be done."""
"279",278,"Trenton Judson","A masterpiece! One of the most underrated books in American literature. Thompsons search for the American dream is a journey that leads him through the absurd. This journey is taken at face value, as Thompson and his ""lawyer"" alter their own perceptions to see the true absurdity of reality, the American dream, and Las Vegas. A great book to read in connection with this is Camus The Stranger. There is a lot more philosophy in Thompson's book than I ever thought was possible. A great surprise, which is laugh-out-loud funny! Also, I recommend Thompson's biography, a documentary narrated by Johnny Depp, called simply, Gonzo. "
"281",280,"ashok","I had watched the film adaption of this book directed by Terry Gilliam sometime back, so when I spotted the book in a bookstore I picked it up.The book, like the movie is an outrageous roller-coaster ride fueled by a variety of drugs which pushes the protagonists to the very edge of reason.I read the book in one sitting and I would read it again."
"282",281,"Marky","Still a great look at how the other half lives."
"287",286,"Fred","HECK YES!"
"288",287,"Kapater","One of the greatest works of modern American literature."
"289",288,"Shadi Mirza","The single most important book of the Dope Generation also has a lot to say about any generation; the message you take from this seminal work from Thompson will differ depending on the context in which you were raised."
"290",289,"David Crow","The funniest, most poignant, zest-filled account of the death of counter-culture."
"293",292,"Rob Dinsmoor","This book was my favorite in college."
"295",294,"Derrick McCluskey","Hilarious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"296",295,"Bryce Warman","Had I not read this during my formative years I may have grown up into something resembling a successful adult. "
"298",297,"Mackenzie","Anyone enjoying 70s culture would enjoy this as a read. Not my favorite of Thompson's work, but definitely a defining piece of pop culture."
"299",298,"Scott Springer","If you don't like Hunter S. Thompson there's something wrong with your version of reality. You really need to read this book. I guess you can watch the movie too, but it's not as good as the book. Go read it now."
"301",300,"Decy","Everybody knows this. It's genius, as is Hunter !If you haven't read it, get on it."
"302",301,"Ted Prokash","OK. A great read. I think everything that needs to be said about this book has been said. Buy the ticket, etc., etc. The one thing that disappointed me over time was HST's willingness to buy in to his own celebrity. In the end it ruined him. I started reading him when I was in jail at the age of 19 and I was absolutely blown away by his style, his use of words, his ability to CREATE ACTION on the page. I remember seeing him on the cover of High Times and thinking, WTF? Does he really want to be seen as the ""hero of the drug people""? Drug use should be an incidental detail about a person. When it becomes the centerpiece of a cult of personality, then you've got a pretty shallow cult. I think Hunter sold his soul a bit in this regard."
"303",302,"Matthew Leach","Drug filled, surreal, riotously funny and daringly original. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is one of those books that grabs hold of you right from the first page and proceeds to shake you around until the very last. Tom Wolfe summed up Hunter S Thompson better than anyone when he said 'There are only two adjectives that writers care about, brilliant and outrageous. Hunter Thompson has a freehold on both of them.'This is nothing other than a brilliant novel."
"304",303,"Sebastian Church","This book was an adventure far from any literary exploration I have experience before. Thompson's self-projection through Raoul Duke allows for a clear, yet convoluted voice that must be read feverishly. It is as though Duke's narration forces the reader to assume his frenzy as norm in order to grasp the happenings of the novel. Thompson's cornucopic descriptions blur the margins of reality, again forcing the reader to accept what is happening whether it is a product of the protagonists' binge or mere reality. I can't say that I learned how to warp reality in writing, but I can say I'm convinced it is possible. The disconnected description also taught me that description is not necessarily about exacting an image, but more about creating a strong idea of the image and leaving room for the reader to imagine the minor details."
"305",304,"Jackson","Read it a number of times, and it never gets old. It's perfectly chaotic and warped, and I do recommend it."
"308",307,"Justin Cromer","Good old Hunter S...... This guy is amazing and although his demise was tragic, he went out on his own terms. If you haven't read this carnal pleasure, drug fueled novel stop what your doing immediately and go get the damn thing. "
"310",309,"Sydney","Surprisingly amazing."
"312",311,"zxvasdf","I enjoyed this ride. Thompson has a talent of conveying the bizarre with a mystic quality that is at once hilarious and harrowing. Sometimes you wonder if he's gone over the edge then he makes an observation that makes you realize, no, this dude is a tightrope artist. In Hell's Angels he discusses the edge, that only those who have gone over it can see it. So Thompson sees the edge, a garrote tight hangman's rope across a chasm and does the Charleston on it. Degrees of insanity rise and the calm collected observation and career making personal decisions rise in direct proportion. He is a man who knows what he is doing although it may not be obvious especially during episodes of drug psychosis. What did I take from it? What was the Savage Heart of the American Dream? Greed? That's a given in Vegas. Drugs? Well, I don't know what America would be without its drugs. The corrosion of spirit and pervasive ignorance? With Progress you've got to start somewhere. The freedom to run rampant through a town of unawares? It's Vegas! That doesn't count. So, what did I take from it? I'm not sure, really, but I sure as hell was entertained. "

"326",325,"Loretta","An absolutely brilliant classic! So much better than the movie!"
"327",326,"Mat Montgomery","An adventure entirely made up by both the protagonist and the author. Ignores story arc, chronology, and lands smack dab at purpose on every page. The actual events of 1971 are near the top of my time travel bucket list. I would love to be an independent observer of what really happened, to report on the reporters. A book from the perspective of a Lacerda who wouldn't bugger off when asked."
"329",328,"Mike Cipra","The sheer velocity of this book is unparalleled, and the fact that HST manages to fit introspection into his prose is fairly incredible. If you haven't read this book, do yourself the favor."

"335",334,"Dawn","I read this book right after college while traveling through Europe. I was on an adventure and the book was a journey as well. So put together, it made for quite the experience. Such a great time in my life. . .and Hunter S. Thompson was mesmerizing to me at that age. . .hence the 5 stars."

"341",340,"jaye","classic outragousness"
"343",342,"Lorraine","This book had possibly one of the best opening paragraphs I have seen in a long time, and the story was bold and humorous - I was hooked from the start. I felt very in tune with their hallucinations and drug-taking as it seemed so natural. There may have been moments where I thought ""ouch, that mix has got to do some damage"" but that passed quickly as Thompson had created their characters (granted partly from autobiographical elements) so well that such surreal events didn't discredit the characters. I've come across pieces of writing about the book beforehand and it seemed to be criticised for promoting drug use, but it all added to the storyline and I don't particularly feel that it promoted it. The book was quirky and amusing and I'd really recommend it - it's not quite like other things I've read before."

"354",353,"Georgia","I loved this book!! This was the first I've read from Thompson and I want to read more. I had heard things about Hunter and his crazy lifestyle but I didn't know much and decided to give fear and loathing a read and I just thought ""this is insane!!! How is this real? How did he genuinely live this way?"" Amazing!! If I take anything away from this book it's to just live life how you want to live it and don't let anyone tell you differently. Or just do what the fuck you want and don't give a shit about others, definitely worth the read :)"
"356",355,"Robert Taylor","One of my favorites. All time. I even thought that the movie was one of the best interpretations of a literary work I've ever seen."

"362",361,"Kedar","This little gem is like one of those drugs in the back of the Red Shark. You never know what the good doctor is going to pick up next and garble something.I guess now I realize why people praise Hunter S. Thompson so much. He has practically introduced a lot of new phrases that have become staple material later on. Such as ""Passively hostile"" (passive aggressive), ""in the general direction of..."" (that Monty Python line) and some others.I loved the commentary on the phasing out of Uppers and the demand of Downers (that happened along with Nixon), the few lines on general drug-life during the late 60s (I remember being amazed by that line where the doctors writes about driving to any place and still being able to find drug-addled crazy people.), and the metaphors used to describe people from under a drug haze.My favourite line from the book, amongst others, is ""In a scene where nobody with any ambition is really what he appears to be, there's not much risk in acting like a king-hell freak.""I wonder if I can say that it is a problem, but Johnny Depp narrated the book most of the time interspersed with shouts from Benicio Del Toro.Someday, I'll read the book again and write sweat out a book proper review. Someday, I'll also visit Vegas and see if some of it still stands true as described in the book."

"373",372,"AnnaLisa","Very entertaining and descriptive tale of a newspaper reporter's drug induced adventure from California to Las Vegasand back, with his willing attorney friend as his partner, to cover a motorcycle race through the Nevada desert as well as a drug convention filled with district attorneys from all over the country and narc cops. A fun-filled ride through the chaotic drug haze of his time in Las Vegas and and the people he meets along the way including a young girl on acid who paints only Barbara Streisand portraits and a 'lonely' highway patrolman. Good for a lot of laughs. "

I hope that everyone who saw the movie ended up going to read the book, but then how many people who hadn't reads the book would go to the film?The cartoons, the bile, the observations, the mad flights of fancy -- what's not to love?"
"378",377,"Jacqueline","I adore hunter s. thompson"
"380",379,"Taryn","To enjoy erratic and pointless action is to enjoy Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Thompson is a mastermind with his journalistic works, based more in fact than fiction even at the wildest of scenes. Well known to be one of the best books over the “dope decade”, F&LiLV is comical and worldly as it describes the exuberant adventures of one Raoul Duke as he spends a drug induced paranoia in Las Vegas while attempting to cover the Mint 400 and, ironically, a seminar on narcotics and other dangerous drugs. Although I had seen the movie, I’m not sure what I was expecting when I picked up this book. I knew, in reality, what it would be, but I did not envision the extent of this seemingly exaggerated lapse into factious fiction. Thompson’s writing style entices the reader with an air of reality, leaving the them to assume that this work is truly fiction until he mentions himself by name in supposed accompany with Raoul through a letter from the attorney who had been present from the beginning. Do not skip out on this; although the movie is what initially brought this work to my attention with a shining light of adoration, reading the initial print is an enlightening companion to the movie. Every moment of Thompson’s estranged writing is better viewed than read; however, every moment of one Johnny Depp’s acting is better read than viewed. They walk a tight rope together, hand in hand. I highly suggest that anyone who has a liking for hilarity and confusion lay their eyes on this work of art at least once. Drug filled and indecent, Thompson is a writer to be reckoned with."
"382",381,"Luke Losik","Hunter S Thompson is amazing. He has quickly become one of my favorite authors to read. I am currently reading his book the rum diary. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a book that is a must read."

"394",393,"Jason Bernhardt","A classic for the ages about drugs, violence, drugs, Vegas, and more drugs! The movie was good but it's certainly nowhere near as good as the book."
"396",395,"Killthepopular","I really enjoyed this. It kind of meandered around a bit but the writing was really good. Very funny throughout in a kind of rhythmic, monotonous way: it was the same shtick all the way through (paranoia, fractured logic, re-occuring lines like ""as your attorney i advise you to take the Mescalin now"") but it was good shtick, and not something i feel that i've really seen anywhere else. I suppose it was a bit of a one trick pony, perhaps if it had gone on for another hundred pages it would have become kind of tiresome.Having read it quite recently, i already struggle to remember many of the details, I don't think it'll change my outlook on life, or really stick with me or anything, but it was certainly a fun read. Not one of the greatest books ever written or anything, but I'd certainly recommend it."
"400",399,"Vi","Screw Mark Twain, Hunter S. Thomson is a real american classic. "
"402",401,"Gavin","Had I mentioned that Mr. Thompson is in my top two all time favourite writers? Oh, I had. Well, this is the perfect introduction to his writing, it's not terribly long, is terribly funny and goes along at a million miles an hour. Prone to exageration he may have been, but damn the man could write."
"407",406,"Mike MacConnell","I've read this book many times since I first opened it, and I've gotta say, this is the most psychotic, drug laced, bizarre, off-the wall, blazingly funny book I have ever read. I highly recommend it for a time when you want to lose touch with reality. "

"410",409,"Russell","While I was out on the town one night at a blues concert, a middle aged man who I had a smoke with, told me I reminded him of Hunter S. Thompson. So, I read his book at the Book Keeper and thought it was good enough to buy. I was not wrong. The movie isn't too bad either. Nor is Where the Buffalo Roams, an older film."
"413",412,"Jason neese","it brings a tear to my eye to read the opening pages of this masterpiece. no one has written about drugs on drugs better. when he blew his brilliance all over the back wall of that compound in colorado he left a legacy of literature in this book alone that has changed the landscape of writing forever."
"414",413,"Bryson McCheeseburger","Absolutely one of my favorite books and makes me want to start writing again. This was a re-read, but you can't just read Hunter once. It's impossible..."
"415",414,"Paloma","This book is a great depiction of Thompson in his prime. This book captures the true spirit of the author and the Gonzo Journalism that changed writing forever. Not to mention that it is also a nailbiting tale of drugs, crime, and the search for the ""American Dream"". I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in seeing what all the hype about Hunter S. Thompson is all about. "

The story is great, and the writing is excellent. With this book, Hunter S. Thompson changed writing the way rappers changed music, by shifting the focus from the art to the artist."

"421",420,"Grace Jensen","I can only imagine the people that use this as their cornerstone for generational philosophy.

"437",436,"Laura Hammill","Back in my college days my sister and I would take this paperback with us to the Deli Haus in Kenmore Square Boston and just laugh and laugh at different pages...the writing was just so damn dry and witty it had us in stiches!"
"438",437,"Warren","I wish I had read this a long time ago. It's currently fighting with Confederacy of Dunces as my all-time favorite."
"439",438,"Jackie Intres","What a mind fuck. This book was my gateway drug (har!) to The Man with the Golden Arm and Naked Lunch. In general, I find the subgenre of drug literature terrifying because it is so viscerally assaulting--all of your senses are attacked at once. But the great thing about this book is that this trippy horrible journey is really funny and I found myself caring about the protagonist. "
"440",439,"Patrick Ross","I read this book immediately after completing Tom Wolfe's The Electric Koop-Aid Acid Test. I highly recommend that pairing. Wolfe chronicles the end of a period in which drug consumption was romanticized as some sort of higher experience. In Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Thompson makes several references to the end of that era, and instead portrays his remarkable drug binge in far more honest terms, a simple extended exercise in self-indulgence. In that sense, it means the protagonist may be harder to like, but his honesty wins you over.Thompson's prose sizzles, and moves you along as fast as the best fiction page-turner, which is particularly remarkable in that, well, nothing really happens. He has a series of misadventures, some caused primarily by his traveling companion, but he is hardly an innocent party and he makes no claims to be. But in between these moments of high humor, Thompson's narrator takes the opportunity to explore, personal-essay-style, broader questions about sociology, culture, law-and-order, politics, and the American Dream. Those were my favorite portions of the book, and a couple of them reference Ken Kesey, the protagonist of The Electric Koop-Aid Acid Test.This book is categorized as ""nonfiction/journalism."" It is in fact a standard in the ""gonzo journalism"" style that Thompson pioneered. As a writer with a more traditional journalism background, I normally prefer narrative nonfiction that strives for authenticity and accuracy. But a reader is wise to not worry about how much of this story is real, and just sit back and enjoy the ride. "
"441",440,"Hilary","So, I'm sitting with my boyfriend and we're sharing a good beer (seeing how good people drink good beer) and he's explaining to me all the books that he's put into my birthday present. He mentions Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail and I feel compelled to make a shameful confession. ""I've never read the original, you know.""""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas I nod. Immediately he gets to his feet and leaves the room. Wordless the book is pretty much thrown at me and that was that. I picked it up after I finished the book I was already reading book Lamb and immediately set about reading it. About three hours later I was done.This book is pure Hunter S. Thompson, an author I dearly love. It's insanity, complemented by the illustrations of the inimitable Ralph Steadman and loads of wit and insight. Looking for the American Dream? Yeah, if you look hard enough you'll find it here. Looking for answers? They're here. Everything is in there, caught up in the whirl and the mad mad world that only Hunter S. Thompson could see clearly and deliver with the gonzo journalism. Basically - give it a read sometime, everyone."
"442",441,"Chris Kaeff","I've never laughed so hard at a book as Fear and Loathing, and I suspect I never will. Every word rings true. HST is a witness to the generation that finally went insane, and a guardian to those who have been taken along for the ride. Miss ya Doc."
"443",442,"Shanna","I saw the movie before reading the book, but that didn't ruin the story whatsoever. This book is definitely worth the read, it was pretty interesting hearing the story in H. Thompson's narrative. "
"444",443,"Noel","I found this book to be quite an entertaining book. Before reading this text, I have never had the opportunity to read anything written by Hunter Thompson. I did watch the movie and enjoyed Johnny Depp's portrayal of Hunter. Because of this novel, It has inspired me to read more Hunter, and actually buy all his other monographs. "
"445",444,"Joel Gun","This book is one of my all-time favorite reads! Like much of Edgar Allen Poe's work, I can read this book over and over without ever tiring of it. Hunter S. Thompson has so much energy and color to his writing that you can read Fear and Loathing 100 times over and you will still pick up something new you didn't notice before. "
"446",445,"Grupunindockrox","so far so great"
"449",448,"Lee","You must read this. That is all."
"452",451,"David Minor","""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" is what is referred to as ""Gonzo Journalism"" and personally what this means is that Thompson was supposed to be covering a motorcycle race in the desert and just got sidetracked by all the drugs. The book almost seems like a work of fiction because what he describes in it seems to be too over the top to be real. Thompson's narrative voice is probably one of the most distinctive in non-fiction and it is entertaining as hell. A good example of how to balance one's internal monologues in prose while making some very vivid descriptions about how one's thoughts were altered at that time."
"453",452,"Jake Nickell","My favorite book of all time."
"454",453,"Len","Hunter Thompson's best. A wild ride into the heart of the American Dream. Was the Dream already dead or did he kill it by piercing it in the heart? A valid question. And still a must read."
"455",454,"Jiminy Panoz","I can't describe how much I love this book. It's pure gonzo, fueled with illicit substances and much more style. It's so weird you can't stop reading. "
"457",456,"Molly Billygoat","Hunter S. Thompson’s Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a giddy, unpredictable, and hilarious escapade of one journalist and his attorney’s travels while on an exorbitant amount of drugs. In Las Vegas to cover a story, the real story centres around their drug-induced mania. Wherever they go, they create chaos as distressing for the characters as it is hilarious for the reader. The characters are erratic and bombastic; two tornadoes that suck in anyone who stands too near.There are many statements pertaining to freedom and its perceived connection to the culture of taking hallucinogenic drugs. At one point the journalist states that, “It is worth noting, historically, that downers came in with Nixon.” This reflects the novel’s overall sense of lamentation at the loss of the hallucinogenic drug culture and its replacement with the more stifling drug culture surrounding substances such as heroine and benzodiazepines. The main characters are certainly reckless and dangerous, but it is important to note that their desire to take drugs is based on mind-expansion rather than escapism.The prose describing their conundrums, as they chase this drug-addled sense of freedom, is deeply humorous. The psychological journeys and human interactions hold a sharp sense of realism. As far as fun is concerned, this novel is a fast-paced dose of pure entertainment. "
"463",462,"Daphna Rodin","The fear & loathing of this hippydom must is a total vaporing gas "
"464",463,"Marlo","Vivacious, dark, chaotic, and ridiculous. Incredibly quotable (I loved, loved that part about projecting yourself on a twelve-foot screen on LSD -- and of course that quote about the wave and the watermark of sixties culture in San Francisco). Another one of those books that it's easy to understand why they're such a popular classic. If you like The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test (and I do), you'll love this.I watched a documentary on Dr. Thompson (""Gonzo: the life of Hunter S. Thompson"") mid-way through reading this, which only enhanced my experience."
"466",465,"Corey","Probably my all-time favorite book. (of all time)"
"468",467,"Theo Shantz","Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is very bizzare when it comes to books and how their written. The book is about a man named Raoul Duke and his lawyer Dr. Gonzo who go to Las Vegas to wirte about a desert race. The only thing that makes the trip intresting is that both men had a suitcase full of every drug a man can get his hands on. From the beginning of the story to the very end, the men are tripping out on every drug in the suitcase and roaming around Las Vegas hallucinating. I like the way the book is written because he makes the reader think if their hallucinating or really describing whats going on. What's hard to understand about the book is why is everything happening the way it's happening. Someone who doesn't really know about drugs or how people act o them could get really confused and maybe frestrated because they don't know why the events in the book are happening the way they are. With that, I feel like this book has a limited audience so I wouldn't recommend this book to just anybody, just the people who I feel could deal with all the drugs and profanity this book dishes out. My favorite quote from the book is; ""Don't stop here, this is bat country,"" because it is at the very beginning of the book where they are driving through the desert and they start to trip on acid. This book isn't for all to read but I feel like people shoulf give it a chance because it is very unique inn the way it's written. "
"470",469,"David Cox","My favorite book. A brilliant and hilarious look at what happens when you outlive the movement that has your own personal ideals set as its foundation. An apocalyptic view that's not only brought about by substance abuse, but also by seeing the ""bastards"" win. Timeless in every way."
"471",470,"Marius","it's clear that the American Dream has always been international and further inquiry is needed in facing head on the hollowed out cores of dead queen bee hives, such as Valletta & Iraklion, islamabad & Ulan Bator, Danzig & Berlin. a tip of the hat to the master asshole"
"473",472,"Jean Marie Davis","Fantastic. As a writer, we always have fun with Hunter S Thompson. This book is so much fun it'll make you feel like you need a shower later. Loved every page. The movie is great too..."
"474",473,"Diego González","What can I say? A definitive novel chronicling two fundamental aspects of American life: drugs and politics. This book grabs the mind and infects it with an indomitable spirit, much like being possessed by the author. I couldn't think or write in another style for weeks after reading it. Rare and thrilling to see such profound insight coupled with a clear description of a drug experience."

"479",478,"Ubersmaug","OMG, where to start. One of the funniest books I've ever read, esp. the grapefruit in the bathtub scene. Wait, did I say that out loud, or just think it? I'd better clarify."
"482",481,"Calem Paine","This is an absolute one of a kind book. It doesn't have a storyline as such consisting mostly of observations and comments over the concept of ""The American Dream"", sought as it is by the protagonist and his attorney. At least their twisted idea of it.Plunging straight into the story as they're heading for Las Vegas to cover a desert race for a magazine with a trunk full of dangerous drugs, a cassette player and a stub-nosed .357 as their main tools.It is a wild and strange ride from beginning to end and one there's not to be missed."
"484",483,"Lindsay Patton","Had to read it for my nonfiction class when my teacher wanted to put a fiction twist on a nonfiction story. I loved the book and it led me to watch the movie."
"485",484,"Kails","love it."
"486",485,"Chris Munz-Pritchard","This is Hunter S. Thompson at his best! "
"487",486,"Aisling","Hilarious read and very worth the time. Both characters extremely like-able and written entertainingly by Hunter S."
"491",490,"Lyndsy","Quite possibly the only book I have red cover to cover in one sitting and laughed out loud all the way through! How did I leave it so long and allow my hubby to secretly have fun with this completely outrageous but colourful rendition of a wacky trip of a drug addict and his equally druggie attorney as they trek across the desert in search of an American Dream? This just oozes charm from each page, the narration is clear, deliciously descriptive and cleverly poetic, this is a classic that takes you straight back to the '70's (whether you lived it or not) and seductively entices you through the journey like you were the backseat passenger of this psychadelic frolic. Free love and peace man, this is one novel that I know I will come back to time and time again. Genius."
"492",491,"Golden","I love this book and all its insanity. I snort with laughter everytime a sentence begins with ""as your attorney, I advise you to..."" do something hideously illegal. And through the lunacy a clearly thought through search for the American dream. Thompson had talent for the fiction and non fiction."
"493",492,"Shaneka","Loved this book. Probably my favorite. Its a wild, crazy ride through time, drug use, adventure and the American dream. Will introduce you to a very up front, in your face writing style."
"494",493,"Kimmy","Checking out books from the library is SO much cheaper than finding/funding a Cadillac full of drugs. And almost as good... right? (the book made me think so)"
"497",496,"Bob Hartley","Very quotable. Makes me wonder why everyone always quotes the same part about bat country. Very much improved by Steadman's illustrations, a true inspiration. I wouldn't know the experience of reading this without having tried drugs yourself but I imagine it's less than recommendable."
"498",497,"Jennifer Tiemann","This book provides endless conversation between myself and my oldest brother. It is a modern classic... all I have to say is, ""Golf shoes."""

"512",511,"Pippa Jones","By far one of the most humorous and unforgettable novels I have yet to read. A story about a drug induced road trip. Who could refuse ? Shown with brilliant humour there is a dark undertone pervading this novel about hunter s thompsons true addiction to the use of narcotics."
"518",517,"Andrés Cabrera","A-B-C del periodismo Gonzo, y de las experiencias de Hunter S. Thompson en el cubrimiento de la Mint 500. Como bien indica el nombre, la paranoia y el uso desaforado de drogas serán el catalizador para las mejores risas y algunas críticas mordaces. "
"519",518,"Rob Schoenbach","There are great moments of social relevance in this book but the memorable-ness of it is in the drug fuled romp around Vegas. IT'll make you feel high."
"520",519,"Bridget Weller","One of the best opening paragraphs of any novel, ever. A truly wonderful read, in a slightly bent kinda way. Enjoy, and keep an eye out for those bats."
"522",521,"Bea T","Simply amazing. What a wild ride. Doctor Thompson does it right, incorporating craziness with a unique brand of sanity. This is a must for anyone who wants to take a step out of their known boundaries."
"523",522,"Alex Owings","Never before has a movie been made that so closely tracked its literary source material as the movie Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Anyone who liked that movie, plus a handful of others, would love this book. It is excellent, filled with witty and cutting observations, and an excellent story. The book tells the story of two drug addled folks on an epic binge in Las Vegas in their attempts to find the American Dream buried somewhere out in the desert. They find it. It isn't pretty. One word of caution: Thompson leaves a lot of events out of the telling, only to reference them later on. So there are moments where he talks about something and you're left thinking ""what the hell is he talking about, that dude he met three days earlier? He didn't meet that dude three days earlier!"" Facts just sort of wind up present in his consciousness, without any recollection of how they got there."
"525",524,"E","I have spent a lot of time in Las Vegas, and this book still describes the city perfectly. Don't just watch the movie. If you have to choose between the book and movie, read the book. Thompson's prose is perfect. He tells you enough without boring you. The dialogue is insane. If only more authors had Thompson's style, I'd have more favorite books. Who writes like this anymore? This makes most new books on the shelves hideously boring. I wish the next Hunter S Thompson would arrive already..."
"527",526,"Adam82","Wildly hilarious. The movie was good, but the book was great. It will have you bolling! A book you will not be able to put down. It'll make you want to investigate the affects of pychodelic drugs. "
"529",528,"Danny Edwards","Violent and cruel madness. If after reading this you are not tempted to be recklessly creative and irresponsible you need to reread it."

"550",549,"Taylor Livingston","vivid and trippy at the same time a book that takes more than one read to really grasp"
"551",550,"Cesslie Pharr","One of Hunter's best!"
"552",551,"Nick Blasier","I expected it to be wild and over the top, and I guess it was, but there was a definite sense of purpose that I didn't expect. Reminded me of Bret Easton Ellis and American Psycho, but it felt like it had more depth. I don't think the largely autobiographical nature of it is what made it, but more that he ruminates on what he's doing and what it means, and he does it regularly and a little more directly. But maybe I just missed that part when I read American Psycho. I enjoyed this much more than I thought I would."
"553",552,"Jeremie Pettit","I've seen the movie several times, and if you are hoping for some new material there really wasn't any. I've gone back and done this in the past and there's usually SOMETHING extra, but the Johnny Depp depiction is almost a shot for shot visualization of the story. That said, it was still a lot of fun to delve into the world of the degenerate, drug-loving author. I would definitely recommend, but not for the faint of heart! "
"554",553,"Jillx27","I first read this in serial format in Rolling Stone magazine many years ago. I loved it then as I love it now. Shear madness, plenty of drugs and no conforming to authority. What is not to love?"
"555",554,"baggyparagraphs","After seeing the recent documentary about Hunter S. Thompson, I read the book for the fourth time; it's always such a pleasure to rediscover forgotten details from the story and to reexperience the language. Just opening to any random page, I find something worth repeating. For example, when Raoul Duke returns his rental car, which has taken a merciless beating, he is offered a Mercedes limo but says, ""I'll have a natural American car, or nothing at all."" His first experience of driving the Caddy causes him to observe that ""all that elegant, upholstered weight lashing across the desert was like rolling through midnight on the old California Zephyr."" "
"556",555,"Maurya","I'd seen the Johnny Depp starrer and read HST's other 'amphetamine induced psychosis' works, so I always knew this would be good. Yet this book caught me completely by surprise. First, because it is difficult to imagine that any human being can function even at the most rudimentary level with his body full of the cocktail of drugs (more like a four-course meal) that HST claims to have. And then there's HST patented (literally - Gonzo journalism was first popularised by him) style of writing. We get to see flashes of his genius in F&L in America and F&L on the Campaign Trail but it in Vegas that HST lets himself go completely. Insults, rants, hallucinations and humor abound as HST and his Lawyer paint Vegas red, blue and every color of the rainbow. One of the best books I've ever read. Highly recommended."
"557",556,"S.D.","A contemporary classic of extended literary satire, Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas replaces Candide as the definitive attack on optimistic idealism. Feinting a swift and brutal assault on the naïve ideals that undermined the 1960s, Thompson uses the ploy to launch total war on the mythological idealism of the American Dream at large. Stylistically, Fear & Loathing engages the vague exaggeration for which Thompson’s Gonzo Journalism is renowned to full satiric effect, leaving the reader as unsure of reality as the idealism it vilifies. Yet in Fear & Loathing’s keystone “tidal wave” passage, a fleeting ideal reality appears, revealing the ironic and obvious, punch line: It’s not idealism, but extremity of belief, that saps the ability to affect change."
"559",558,"John Fine","I couldn't get enough of this book. It's strange and intelligent at the same time. A fascinating ride through a world I never managed to see personally. Something for the imagination."
"562",561,"Gregory Tkac","I had read Thompson's book on the Hell's Angels first, and while I thought it was an interesting book and enjoyed reading it, it didn't live up to the expectation of what I assumed ""gonzo journalism"" to be. This book is where I got my rocks off in his world, in more ways than one. To my young 20's mind, this was exactly the kind of reading experience that I was hoping to have, and I'm glad I read it when I did. Equally hysterically funny and off-putting, I'd consider this a masterpiece of modern literature."
"563",562,"Jim Wormold","This book has just the right distance from the muck of it so I can still laugh and love it. How can you not be charmed by the insanity of the landscape and characters. A masterpiece of non fiction. "
"564",563,"Brit Gray","Hunter S. Thompson is one of my heroes, and this is one of my favorite books - it's what got me interested in journalism. When he died, I got so many phone calls, because it was just an automatic connection in their minds, me to him. Mahalo, Hunter."
"566",565,"Eleanor","Brilliant! Very funny and twisted. I read it after seeing the film and just had Johnny Depp's beautiful face with me throughout the book, which wasn't necessarily a bad thing... Would like to read again, definitely. "
"568",567,"Carlos Blancas","The Great American Novel. Tied with Huck Finn. Better than Gatsby."
"569",568,"Max B-t","I think this book is an instant classic, even if you feel strongly against drugs you can’t help to feel and sympathies for Hunter after all he goes through. The book moves at a very fast pace, things are constantly happening and it never gets boring but when it needs to calm down it does, one example is a chapter in the middle of the book where Hunter tells us about the hippie movements and the 1960’s which is both touching and sweet but also kinda tragic as it's writen more or less as an farewell letter to the very movement itself. All in all a great read, everyone who’s a fan of “dirty realism” or is into “Gonzo” should read this immediately!"
"571",570,"Steven Eggleton","The first time I saw Gilliam’s film adaption of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, was in the summer of ’98. I was 21 and trying to bang this chick, so I decided to take her on the quintessential date –dinner and a movie. The only problem was, when we got to the restaurant I decided to forego dinner and get loaded on Long Island ice teas, instead –drinking as many as my belly could hold. Then, drunk as a monkey, I decided to sneak a six pack of MGD into the theater, sit in the back with my date, and make an ass out of myself. Sitting there, hollering at the screen, and accidentally kicking over empty bottles as they clinked together and rolled down the aisle making a tinkling sound all the way, I knew I was watching something special. It was a sort of contained madness. Pure insanity. Thankfully, the majority of the theater patrons were as messed-up and twisted as me.Since that initial viewing, I’ve seen Fear and Loathing countless times (usually in an altered state of mind), but for some reason I never read the book until now. And let me tell you, it’s everything the movie is and more. Hunter S. Thompson is a juggernaut! The prose is fast and straight forward, cutting to the quick. There is very little bullshit in Thompson. He holds a mirror up to society and himself, in an attempt to unabashedly show us the grotesque in us all. I won’t delve into the novels deeper themes, as I am not an intellectual, but I will say the language is beautiful and angelic with glimmers of poetry strewn throughout (I know some will call me crazy for saying that, but it’s my opinion). He has an ability to boil things down to their essence, not a word is wasted, all the while maintaining a frenetic pace to the line and a sense of freedom. This airy quality. It’s quite amazing, the technicality of it all. Very skillful and hard to replicate (properly anyway).At any rate, needless to say, I never nailed that girl I took on the date. The most to come of it (no pun intended), was a sloppy hand job on her living room couch that ended with me prematurely ejaculating onto her chunky brown thigh. Not one of my finer moments, but apropos to the evening I suppose. I think Hunter would have liked it that way."
"572",571,"Gayle","A hell of a trip!! "
"575",574,"Katrina","This book is about a reporter Raoul who goes to Las Vegas with his attorney Dr.Gonzo to report on a motorcycle race but completely and heavily drugged up. It's hard to differ between what is real and what they are making up while they are strung out. It's essentially about the search for the American Dream and how today's generation has no real desire to succeed. I found it halarious, but maybe that's just me. The movie is so fun and I'm excited they are making ""The Rum Diary"" in to a movie as well."
"576",575,"Steve Larson","Excellent well written stream of consciousness often very funny!"

"582",581,"DJMikeG","Writing a little, rushed review of this could never do this modern classic justice. I'll put it this way: this is my favorite book I have ever read, and I've read it over 5 times. This is one of the greatest pieces of writing ever put on the page, a beautiful, savage, and hilarious style piece. A must read for anyone who is interested in writing as art. "
"583",582,"Sander","A crazy trip in Las Vegas gone wrong (or right, depends how you look at it).I saw the film first and I could still enjoy the book. A counter-culture classic"

"587",586,"Riina Y.T.","Just. Brilliant.I bought that many years back - used to be one of my favorites. Haven't re-read it in forever, and probably won't =D Nevertheless, a book / story you just won't forget. "
"588",587,"Rick","I can see why Thompson was so popular. This is a wild ride. What an imagination...or was it all true?"
"590",589,"Jane","Loved this book, read it at the age of 18 and it's a pity they made a film. The book is so superior in every way.."
"591",590,"Joe Soltzberg","This was an excellent book I just finished reading the last week. Thompson is a legend and rightfully so. His writing is conversational in nature and never dull. He paints relatively simple scenes and events into exciting tales. The book does an excellent job describing the end of the 70's and its lasting influence outside of California, while detailing some of the personal life of Thompson himself (how much of the account is completely true will never be known). Also, his book about the Hells Angels is definitely worth reading."
"592",591,"ba","I read this book in my early 20's and thought it was one of the most significant books I had ever read. These days I remember it fondly as the book that introduced me to Mr. Thompson's voice, which I continue to like a lot, although Fear and Loathing may seem a bit more overboard to me now than it did on first reading."
"595",594,"Jesiah","Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is one of the craziest books that I've ever read. It's revolves heavily around drugs (as seen in every chapter) and it turns into one of the most ironic and humorous books that I've ever seen."
"597",596,"Prakriti","If you think it is not possible to think coherently when high, or to pen it down in a way that you can convey those thoughts AND make them sound interesting to people who are not high, who have never been high, please read this book. Lot of reviews mention this as a fake 'high' account, penned from memory rather than actually through the process, that it is not really gonzo. To those, I say, poppycock. You are missing the point.This is a blast of a book, so much fun that you would want to read it again and again and again. I have an audio reading of the book that I carry with me everywhere. It is split up into chapters (each chapter in a separate mp3 file), and I find it interesting enough to have these in a random playlist of songs. I can hear any part, any chapter, in any order, and it is still fun, still makes me grin.This book is a momentous achievement and makes me glad for having read it. Makes my own insipid life (comparatively) brighter by knowing that there are people like Hunter who have lived, lived on the edge, and have done it their way."
"598",597,"H R Koelling","I've read this book four times in the past 20 years. It's one of my favorite. I'll always remember the scene where they ask a waitress if she knows where they can find ""The American Dream"" and she replies that she thinks it's a restaurant (or housing development) just outside of town. I think this is the crux of the novel. I was disappointed it's not included in the Depp movie. "

"601",600,"Lee T.","I remember distinctly finding this book one teenage summer, being blown away, and having it be one of those rare finds that changed my life forever. An incredible classic that redefines writing & living. We can't stop here, this is Bat Country..."
"602",601,"Mat Soole","F****d up awesomeness from the word go! Pure Hunter S Thompson gold."
"603",602,"Salman","Reading this book is like snuffing up countless ounces of poisonous chemicals at regular bouts which distills a different, perhaps more candid, view of things. It is Thompson's criticism of all that was wrong with Nixon era from behind the 'tea-shades of a dope fiend.'The book is a mind-boggling, drug-crazed, roller-coaster ride of two lunatics who lounge through the very heart of Las Vegas with intermittent episodes of murdering frenzy, absurd conversations, comical hallucinations and apt socio-cultural commentary together with an occasional hint of sobriety. In short, I love this book!"
"607",606,"George Presley","Ridiculous and at the same time, genius. How Thompson could experience (and clearly he had to) all these drug induced delusions and transfer them to paper is quite a feat. He captures all the essence of a dream-like realm and lets the reader experience it with him. So bizarre, one has to wonder how he was sane enough to write it. You will love it or consider it a total waste of time. I thought it was excellent!"
"611",610,"Alex Johnson","Anyone who has ever moaned about a headache after a few too many glasses of wine should read this book and never complain again. It was one of those rare things: a book that affirms both the greatness of a film based upon it and its own greatness - and does so without the fact of one having seen the film first from interferring with that affirmation. It is said to have given birth to the style of journalism known as Gonzo. I think this may have been how the muppet was so named - who, remember, always involved himself in his crazy, stunt-like news stories. In Hunter S Thompson's case, this means travelling to Las Vegas with his 'attorney' and a suitcase full of every drug they could get their hands on in search of 'The American Dream'. The narrative around their 72-hours of lunacy has a comical, hard-boiled edge. Raymond Chandler meets Withnail and I. Nevertheless, there is, as one of the reviewers on the sleeve puts it, a deadly serious underlying message which the less discerning might churlishly impute is undermined by the apparent glorification of the debauchery. "
"613",612,"William Rocha","Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is different from the average memoir. You become welcomed into the twisted, drug-enhanced world of Hunter S. Thompson as he goes on a journey to Las Vegas on a search to find the “American dream”. He is accompanied by his so called attorney who serves as his partner in crime. This team of acid head bandits adventure into many casinos, hotels and other mysterious places causing mayhem and confusion to many; creating a story more insane than city of Las Vegas. I would recommend this book to everyone. Especially if you’re looking for an adventure in your reading. This is book is constantly entertaining and something is always happening. Thompson and his attorney are always on the move. Another reason I would suggest this book is its originality of this book. Thompson writings are so unique that he falls into his own genre on Gonzo Journalism."
"614",613,"Geoff Sebesta","This book changed my life. I got a very interesting summer out of this book.Ether is hard to find these days."
"615",614,"Tanya W","Just reread this for like the 30th time. It still holds up as a CLASSIC. "
"616",615,"Doug Campbell","Oh boy. This is an adventure that every mature reader should indulge in. Hunter S Thompson (probably during his days of heavy drinking) takes us on the wild ride of Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo, who pack a suitcase full of miscellaneous drugs and a trunk full of booze, travelling to Los Angeles. Throughout the novel, the two are on a constant altered state of mind, expiriencing L.A. in the strangest way possible. This is a great read and I reccomend it to anyone who is ready for an adventure."
"617",616,"Obak","Saw the movie years ago. One of my favorite J.Depp's performances. The book, like all adaptations was more detailed. And I can see now why celebs and comics flocked to go visit Thompson when he was alive."
"618",617,"Gregsnyder","One of my all time favorites"
"619",618,"Matt Williams","I got given a copy of this when I was fourteen and I fell in love with it from the first page. My friend’s Uncle was the old school hippy type; he was the one who first handed it to me. It was actually the night that I took acid for the first time. It’s not really strange that he chose that moment to introduce me to the book, considering the contents of the novel. I was drunk, stoned, tripping and sat in a house full of old guys doing crack and smoking weed, and I was attempting to read. I got about a quarter way through before I put it down. After that, it was all I could think about, and I even found myself picking it up again during the night, still blathered out my face. This is a great account of life lived on the edge. Two men’s journey to Las Vegas in search of the American dream. Full of laughs, madness and anarchy, this book is thrill after thrill. Hunter’s style of writing is so poetic it’s almost hypnotic, as you find yourself trailing along with him; he gets in your head. His wicked paced stream of consciousness and tangent, maddened ramblings make this novel what it is. Recommend to all! H.S.T r.i.pFreak Power!"

"625",624,"Julio Cesar","Desde la perspectiva del mal viaje,la exageración,la paranoia,el alucine,la atascadez y el Gonzo, Thompson narra su infructuosa búsqueda del sueño americano en su recorrido por lugares oscuros, insólitos e inusuales (dada su ausencia en los lugares comunes). Provocando caos y defraudando a todos sin distinción, guiados por el valeverguismo, el sinsentido y una variada y extensa cantidad de drogas, perdidos en ráfagas de euforia, desesperación y locura, ""Duke"" y su abogado se ven envueltos en situaciones muy locochonas, estresantes y conflictivas, experimentando en una extraña y enferma manera su propia versión del sueño americano."
"627",626,"angela","A must read, period."
"630",629,"Bek"," My head feels like it has been through the dryer, a round with Muhammad Ali, and then run over with a train after reading this book. I can understand why Thompson suggests that to be in the proper condition to read this book you need to be under the influence of alcohol and subjected to the extreme stimuli of drugs and music. The twisted hallucinations and logic of a drug-crazed man can be a little hard to handle sober."
"640",639,"Jade","This is such a great book!"
"641",640,"Stephanie Spines","I love this book. It had me laughing out loud at the absurdity of it all. I like many others, saw the film long before I read the movie and it has always been one of my favourites. The book, I think, is very similar to the film so naturally, I loved it too."
"643",642,"Joel Browne","Fucking hilarious. I wish that I had read the book before seeing the film. At no point was I able to vision the characters as anyone other than Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro. Still a great novel which had me laughing out loud many times."

"665",664,"Martin","A co-worker, whom happened to be completely insane, sized me up once and told me I was ready. He handed to me a VHS tape bearing the title, ""Where the Buffalo Roam"". At the time I was living a lifestyle of depraved decadence and over consumption of massive amounts of drugs and booze. While this particular journey had many peeks and valleys the next step in my literary evolution took place under a haze of pot smoke, a quart of rum and a pack and a half a day tobacco habit. After watching the movie with a roommate he stumbed off to his room but instead of retunring with a bong he handed me a copy of this book.I will not kid you and say that being twisted on drugs won't help you understand this book more; it will. Not a necessity but once you dig deeper into the mind and works of one Hunter S. Thompson you will crave whiskey, beer and ""...everyone narcotic known to mankind..."" Enough of my story, this is after all a book review.A virtually unkown writer was given a line of credit, a hotel room in Las Vegas, NV and an assingment to write a story that he never did. Instead after days of binging, purging and binging some more the man emerged with a cobbling of notes and tape recordings that he lashed together and handed to Rolling Stone magazine. While several other books were written prior to this tome, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas vaulted Hunter S. Thompson into the limelight. For better and worse ""Gonzo Journalism"" was born. The style is by the seat of your pants, insert yourself into the middle of your story and hope you come up with a comrprehsnible and most imporantly publisher worthy book in the end. Thompson invented it so I am not afraid to tell you he does it the best.With his attorney at his side, Hunter searches for the American Dream, ponders the death of the free wheeling 60's and generally blows his own mind along with yours before the story ends.If you are looking to dive into the world of Hunter S. Thompson this probably isn't the best way to start, but this is his Mona Lisa, his swan song, his coup de gras and the story that made him larger than life. My attorney has advised me to write as many reviews of his works as I can and I assure you this is only the first of many. Mahalo."

"680",679,"Hélio Teixeira","reading the book after watching the movie may cause some troubles for some people, mainly because it cuts your imagination off. You've seen the actors portraying the characters and you get stuck on those mental images. On the other hand you seem to know how the story evolves and just lose interest. Luckily, this hilarious book by Hunter S. Thompson worked for me even after watching the movie. I must admit the actors chosen for the movie and the images i remembered seem to be pretty faithfull to the book. it was like seeing the movie in my head again, but with more info and interesting thoughts about the political/cultural background or the drugs sub-world in America. The effects caused by the drugs at a given time are described in a vivid and relentless way, wich takes us to the movie, but add much more to it. But then again, it's been a while since I've seen the flick, so much of the story came by as a surprise. I think the movie is more of an images thing and only on the book you can perceive the story behind it all. The two artistic objects seem to complement eachother very well, but it is the book that gives you the access to that American Dream Hunter S. Thompson was so actively searching, and with a dose of humour that you didnt know if it was deliberate in the movie. It was."

"686",685,"A.R. Zander","Just love everything about this book. It's Hunter at his absolute best. I think the real genius of this book lies in how he has taken a plot and subject matter so filled with chaos and managed to convey it with such clarity.You could say it is similar to Burroughs, but whereas Burroughs' writing just comes across as confusing and muddled on many occasions, Hunter keeps thing clear and proves what a great writer he was.Read it."
"690",689,"Josefina","Funniest most exciting thing I've ever read."
"692",691,"Rob Bailey","A wild, crazy, disturbing and funny... But what Thompson imitators never understand is the sadness and nostalgia at the heart of this novel. Yes there are drugs, guns, booze, strange lizards and hallucinogenic visions but don't think of this book as a purely hedonistic rampage. The wave speech is a beautiful lament for the loss of innocence in post-60s America and deserves its place among the best writing from that country in the 20th century."
"693",692,"Jill Delgrosso","Hunter Thomson is a master of the twisted story."
"695",694,"Edward Lebowski","So now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark—that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.Perché è molto di più che un libro su due sballati. E' il fottuto sogno americano messo in azione, comprendi?"
"696",695,"Joseph Ritsch","So ahead of it's time; the jokes and situations are like reading a comedy from the present. Hard to believe this novel is over 40 years old. I was laughing out loud while reading. I did have the narration of Johnny Depp in my head when reading Raoul Dukes lines. If you enjoyed some drugs in your life, this book is a must read. I didn't care for the political puns, but overall a hilarious novel and you won't be disappointed!"
"699",698,"Po Po","Holy shit, I've never read anything quite like this. What a wild ride. So much depravity, yet mixed in with a good dose of humor.

"704",703,"Halia","A masterpiece. One of the books that will change your life. Hysterical, terrifying, moving and insane, this myth of a journalist and his lawyer spinning through the desert over a single weekend in Vegas in a fire apple-red convertible against the scope of a weird American dream clings like an ether-soaked handkerchief to your face and won't let go. Possibly the most perfect book in existence. "
"707",706,"Pwntalive","Borrowed this one, never returned it. Im realizing im a real asshole about that.Anyways, this is a good book. I like the radioplay that came out before the movie, ive set it to random play in my CD and it still makes about the same sense. I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. I think I'm getting The Fear.Im not in the mood to review this book, not now. Maybe later, but since your reading this, later has not come yet."
"708",707,"R.","Yeah, unfinished. But...but so was his life. (removed from unfinished reads category)***So far, hilarious. Strikes me as odd that I've not been able to get beyond the first few pages in previous readings. Was in the biography section of the library - and is about as biographical, I'd venture, as A Million Little Pieces (which I finally found a used copy at Goodwill recently)...The fact that this was written as a two-parter for Rolling Stone magazine is sad reminder of how The Internet Killed the Writing Star: you don't see gonzo journalism like this in print these days...as any kid with a bottle of ether and an ethernet connection can Go Gonzo. ***Great fun. "
"709",708,"Amanda Gober","Hunter is amazing...makes me want to be a gonzo journalist; however, the journalism I experiences was nothing compared to his. I love the combination of excess and rebellion along with curiosity of this strange country we live in."

"719",718,"Amanda Guderian","The tone is hilarious, the plot is depraved. Thompson sets Vegas and all of America in a new light through the exploitation of so-called American ideals and cultural values during the 1960s and 70s. Thompson experiments with drugs along with all American tough, and his conclusions are sobering. Vietnam, art, the media, Nixon, psychedelic rock, mescaline...like a drug-induced epiphanies moment, everything starts to make sense. I could read the ""wave speech"" over and over again for this revelation. As a side note, the illustrations are a priceless addition to Thompson's unique and iconic brand of humour.As your attorney, I advise you to read the story before you see the movie, if you find you need to see it at all. "
"720",719,"Michael Smith","The Doctor's best. The movie sucked."
"721",720,"Gary J Paddick","Complete mad energy. Have never seen the movie, except for the occasional glimpse of a scene years ago. Unlike Hell's Angels which comes across as a well studied and presented report, Fear and Loathing is pure infectious energy."
"723",722,"Isaac George","Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas by Hunter S. Thompson opens with him and his Samoan lawyer driving into Las Vegas. Thompson is narrating. He lists all of the many drugs that are in the trunk of their car. It is established that he is going to Las Vegas to cover a story. Much of the book is them getting into drugged out adventures in Vegas. At one point the lawyer flies to Las Angeles and Thompson begins to drive there only to get an urgent message that he must go back to Vegas to cover another story. In this book nothing was really gained or lost but it was a fun read and I enjoyed. The main characters always just end up in the same place they started in."
"725",724,"Elizabeth","There is only one Hunter S. Thompson, a fact that many would-be young gonzo journalist would do well to remember. Although I'd never try to emulate him, Thompson—at his best—remains one of my favorite non-fiction writers. "

"731",730,"Emily Willis","""Few people understand the psychology of dealing with a highway traffic cop. Your normal speeder will panic and immediately pull over to the side. This is wrong. It arouses contempt in the cop-heart. Make the bastard chase you. He will follow."" Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is truly insane. The book is about Raoul Duke (the main character based on Thompson) and his attorney going to Las Vegas to write about a derby and eventually a drug conference, while at the same time trying to find the ""American Dream."" While doing so, they trip up on all kinds of drugs imaginable that are kept in the back of their rented, red convertible they call the ""Great Red Shark."" Duke and his attorney pining to find the ""American Dream"" is he main theme of the book. If you're looking for a book that is completely crazy from start to finish, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas does not disappoint. Also, the illustrations throughout the book by Ralph Steadman give a wicked kick! This is the most unique book I've ever read. Thompson pulls you in in ways that are humorous in a screwed up way, clearly shown in the quote above, and the cover depicts the book perfectly in just one picture and a few words. Personally, I don't connect with this book all that much, but I think that doesn't matter. Go with Thompson on his outrageous adventure to find the ""American Dream,"" and believe me, you certainly will not regret it. "
"732",731,"Krystal Frances Mary Castner","""We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a saltshaker half-full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, laughers, screamers... Also, a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of beer, a pint of raw ether, and two dozen amyls. Not that we needed all that for the trip, but once you get into locked a serious drug collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can. The only thing that really worried me was the ether. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an ether binge, and I knew we'd get into that rotten stuff pretty soon. """

"741",740,"Katya Mills","Hunter S. Thompson was an inspiration to me. Sure, he went a bit overboard with drugs and alcohol, but I'm not one to judge. Most of us had, have, or will have our moments on the dark side of life. The fact that he became so mainstream successful as a journalist is all that more impressive, what with his public escapades in Las Vegas and all around the country and the world. Writers are teachers, for other writers especially. One thing Hunter taught me is how to be flamboyant with the pen, and using one's sharp sense of humor in a liberally self-deprecating fashion in order to poke fun or question or even out and out reject aspects of an American (USA) culture gone mad in the twentieth century. There is an honesty in his work. He says some of the funniest and most scandalous things. He mocked himself as much as any other person he might pick on. So rather than coming off as purely jaded and sardonic, he comes off as a product of his own imagination, and just as mad as the culture he was paid to columnize. Make no mistake about it, from the Rum Diaries to this work here, to many others including his weekly grind columns for high profile American magazines, Hunter S. Thompson is a fresh contemporary voice, may he rest in piece. What an interesting life. What an impressive resume. And what a way to go out?! He actually threw a party at his colorado home, a sort of going away party for all his friends and many notable celebs (aka Johnny Depp, Kieth Richards, etc.) to send him home. I must say, I feel sorry for his wife who stood by his side so many years and up until the day he offed himself with a gun, after the aforementioned party, tried to talk him out of suicide. Being most brutally honest with himself in the end (and in video footage I have seen of his later days, playing piano and alcoholic), he realized life was through with him, whether he liked it or not. At least, that was the sense I got. He was a classic in the short (in the span of time) tradition of American pioneers holding strong to their freedoms to tote guns, hunt animals, and write whatever the hell they wanted to without fear of censor. A real fearless sort of living. I admire aspects of Hunter S. Thompson, but mostly admire his writing above all else. You gotta read him. He is part of the pantheon. You will laugh. I promise. "
"743",742,"Matthew Rano","I have heard Hunter S. Thompson described as ""too weird to live, but too rare to die."" This is a book I've reread numerous times. What I think I like most about Thompson's writing is the amount of tension he creates. In bare bones, it is a story about a journalist and his attorney traveling to Las Vegas to cover a pair of stories. But Thompson through his tension turns this seemingly simple plot into exactly what the title suggests: a savage journey to the heart of the American Dream. Thompson provides a shockingly honest social commentary of America at the end of the hippie era; not only about the drug culture, but of police, politics, and traditional American values. I believe part of the tension he creates is by pushing himself to the verge of death and the brink of sanity (he may have crossed that line). As a writer, this book taught me what can be attained by fully immersing yourself in the subject. He did not write about a topic, in a sense, he became the topic. He was certainly a strange, strange genius, but one whom I admire very much."

Once you get passed all of the humor of excess and machismo, it is a description of being in fear of others who don't want to understand and love. It is a magnificent take on what the 60's were and where the drug culture turned to what it is today."
"766",765,"Margarita","Almost impossible to put down. Fun, fast paced and hilarious.I can't believe I hadn't read this before! "

"779",778,"Susan (the other Susan) ","We miss you, HST. I was mad as hell when you ended your own life, and scared too, because you were the one who would forever give the world the finger, laugh off the fear and loathing, and outlive all the Dicks.

"783",782,"Josh Ferguson","I'll forever be a fan of books like this: culturally relevant, witty, sarcastic, humorous, and enjoyable while taking the piss out of the establishment."
"787",786,"Hatuxka","One of my favorite books of all time. Like Thompson I was in that northern California milieu in the late sixties and cannot forget that time, like him, many of my sensibilities are borne from that atmosphere."

"792",791,"Charlotte Sears","This was an amazing book, there wasn't a single part about it I didn't like. His drug use really makes the book, and adds adventure. The search for the classic American dream is an epic plot using distorted reality to describe their adventures along the way"

"795",794,"Daniel Cloutier","Zum Tod lachen, bissig und erstklassig geschrieben. Leider müssen bei einigen der beteiligten Personen Traumata übrig geblieben sein."
"796",795,"Nelson Maddaloni","For a while my only experience with Hunter S. Thompson was one awful movie (Where the Buffalo Roam) and one movie that's frustrating between how it flips from good to boring (title book) and honestly I thought I might've been burned out on Thompson. Then, while rummaging around a book store I finally got a copy of this book and read it. Man, it feels like both films missed the point and missed out on the humor, sadness, high octane and drug filled ride the book has to offer as both nonfiction and fiction, Gonzo journalism in a sense then. This is a ton of fun to read and has a lot of re-read value to it for sure, definitely worth looking into and one hell of a good time!"
"797",796,"Rebecca Joseph","Read of heinous, mind altering chemicals ingested by two brazen pachyderms trundling through America to Las Vegas in search of the American Dream. Journey into the unstable mentality of two serious junkies and be witness to their euphoric highs and frightening lows. This is the 1970's at it's best, infused with drugs, hysteria and perversity. Unforeseen glee at every corner, this one's a page-turner. I loved it!"
"799",798,"Chuck Adkins","Great book on my Vegas trip. This is my first Hunter S Thompson book. If your humor is like mine you will be laughing out loud. This book made me remember all the times i had when i was an undergrad...even though the stories of my past paint me in somewhat questionable terms, it is the stories themselves that have become admirable. "
"800",799,"Kane Harrison","Chaotic and consistently fun. The entire novel is a mess of thoughts throughout with a plot that is staggered through, and it all feels so appropriate.It's strangely easy to route for Raoul Duke, or Thompson, because it feels necessary for him to conquer Las Vegas. It's interesting to see the way that being an intense loon with the right resources allows you to survive a wasteland of corruption and debauchery."
"801",800,"Ben Pablo","Fell in love with Thompson after seeing the film and reading this book. A fastball diagnosis of the depravity of the modern man, and the Stepford Wife kitchen concoction of the American dream. Tremendous reading right here. One of my all-time favorites."
"806",805,"Andrea Vanin","A terrific read from an inspiring author who added so much to the world of journalism!"
"807",806,"Bitemeblair","I really love this book. One of my favorites. I like the style of writing that Hunter does, it's visually stimulating when you read it. Vast amount of details that were not in the film. I suggest people read this before seeing the movie, not that the movie isn't GREAT. Any of the books by Hunter S. Thompson is worth a read. <3"
"808",807,"Honeybadger","I used to do my level best to channel the spirit of HST when setting out to get wrecked. Since I'm still alive and an adult, I've given up on that pursuit. This book is a fantastic waltz through the insane and really pushes all the best parts of the drug counter-culture of the 60's.This really is HST's ""high water mark"""
"809",808,"Devin O'brien","This is one of my favorite books, a tale of drugs, cops and a dusty motorcycle race - not necessarily in that order.It’s insane, absurd, and the drama happens not only in his experience through Nevada and California, but between his mind and reality. This is a book filled with disturbing psychedelic trips- not the book to read if you are on the conservative side. It keeps you enthralled with thompson’s experience with drugs, and living in another state of consciousness. read if you want to experience the mind on drugs without the side effects of taking them!"
"810",809,"Kristophor Graden","Definitely my favourite book. Just perfect writing. Hunter S. Thompson's books are written in a way that nobody else could dream of emulating. "
"811",810,"Alexander Black","For me, Mr. Thompson was one of the few authors that has successfully drawn out the ""other side"" of life. I'm not sure whether it was the drugs or the incredibly profound vocabulary which he used, but I absolutely love the manner in which Hunter S. Thompson writes. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a masterpiece!"
"812",811,"francisco barrera","crazy ass book. greatly written, it provides a first hand account of it is almost like to be a complete junkie"
"814",813,"Beth Starfruit","I read the book before seeing the movie: BIG MISTAKE. It makes much more sense to see the movie first, for some weird reason. But it is an interesting book. If you liked the movie you'll love the book. "
"815",814,"Jim Schwitzer","Thompson is my favorite author & this book is Gonzo at it's best. If you can, try to look past the drug stories and see what HST is getting at. "
"817",816,"Protpisys","a classic"

"823",822,"Mike G","favorite book"
"826",825,"Simon_vickery","This is one of my favourite books of all time. The way Hunter S. Thomson writes is explosively funny and the situations that he gets himself into have to be read to be believed. what makes this story all the more amusing is that it is based on the author's experiences whilst covering a desert race, which, incidentally, he didn't see very much of at all. "
"827",826,"Dennis Bauder","Hunter s Thompson nuff said!!!! still a classic check it out "
"828",827,"Varun Ramesh","Nothing describes this book better than the description listed on the back of it.Hunter S Thompson proves that journalism can survive even the most frenetic drug-addled journeys a man can inflict upon himself and the world. The father of Gonzo journalism, he revels in his unfolding story whilst simultaneously documenting it for future generations."
"829",828,"Tara L.","Love this and can't believe I haven't read until now. Fantastic - Thompson writes like a poet - a deranged poet - but a great one nonetheless."
"830",829,"Rod Rhimes","The chronicles of a journalist (HST) and his erzatz attorney on an adventure to track down the ""American Dream."" I read this book about once a year just to refresh the finer points. "

"835",834,"J.w. Schnarr","Having finally gotten around to reading this, all I can say is this is another one of those books I should have read years ago. I sense the long fingers of Thompson's writing in a lot of the authors I love today. Read this book if you haven't. It scared me how many times I sat back and thought...yep, I know what you mean...lol."
"837",836,"Appy","Hunter S. Thompson is one of my favorite writers and in my opinion anything he writes is great. His stories are creative and unique. The way he describes his life is comical and very intense. I would recommend this book to everyone. "
"838",837,"Grant","This story of a drug fueled rampage through Las Vegas offers two very interesting insights. The first is an interesting insight into the psychedelic, drug fueled children of Vietnam. Thompson, or more accurately Raul Duke, in moments of clarity from his own drug induced haze offers a variety of criticism for himself and his entire generation, not glorifying the abuse of drugs, but not demonizing it either. The second insight is it creates a very new idea of journalism. It is not the standard, write what you see about a certain topic that you normally see in journalism, but instead more of a personal journal, turning the writer's true experiences into a story worth reading."
"839",838,"Pat Dutchman","wild, wacky and dangerous - not neccessarily what happens in las vegas stays in las vegas - tells all"
"842",841,"Staebs","Exactly like the movie...i love it!"
"847",846,"Joe Green","Thompson is my favorite writer... and this is my favorite book of all time. In fact this book ruined my life, because I read it when I was 19-years-old (probably the 3rd book I ever read in my life, to that point), and ever since then I've wanted to be a writer... and I've mostly failed at it. So it either changed my life for the better (made me literate) or for the worse (I got a degree in English).I don't have anything smart or clever to add. See the book, pick up the book, read the book. "
"850",849,"Gerard Fleck","This masterpiece of gonzo journalism takes you on a drugged up road trip from LA to Las Vegas to cover a dirt bike race but runs into a District Attorney convention. The story is great, and the writing is excellent. Hunter S. Thompson changed journalism the way rappers changed music, by shifting the focus from the art to the artist."
"851",850,"Bill Bleuel","It changed my life: what else can you say?"
"852",851,"Andrew C.","Funny, brilliantly written and vivid. It is not the classic 'death of the American dream' or 'the great counterculture novel' as I have seen people refer to it as, but it cannot be denied that HST was an outstanding writer. Fear and Loathing is an extremely entertaining story, and though it seems to inspire some people to 'think deep' about the end of 1960's hippy catharsis, I enjoy this as something to switch off to and simply dive in to a funny drug story written by a sharp, witty, abrasive drug user, and for the most part, a true original. 5*"
"853",852,"Lindsay Nell","Perfect follow-up to Burrough's Junky. There's not a chapter where the narrator isn't fucked up on SOME sort of drug and it makes the book that much more fn and interesting to read. "
"856",855,"Joseph","This was a re-reading of a book that I first encountered shortly after its publication, when I was a younger lad in my early twenties. It seems almost pointless to write a ""review"" because, frankly, there are some readers who ""get"" Hunter Thompson (it helps if one was of voting age during the Post-Watergate 1970s, but this is by no means necessary) and other readers who don't. So, I'll just leave it at that."

"886",885,"Vincent","Las Vegas parano est un livre fou, un trip littéraire sous acide, écrit par l’immense Hunter S. Thompson. Raconter, ce livre barré, fou et malsain est difficile. L’important ce n’est pas l’histoire (le story telling dirons-nous pour faire moderne) mais l’atmosphère débile et délétère qui plane tout le long du récit. Tout ce que vous devez savoir, c’est que ce livre raconte le périple stupéfiant (dans tous les sens du terme) de Duke et de son avocat Maître Gonzo à Las Vegas, la ville du vice et de la décadence.Le reste, c’est de la littérature, le genre de livre qui vous scotche et vous donne envie de le finir d’un trait, comme un shot de vodka. C’est drôle et tragique, brutal et doux, fin et vulgaire et àu bout de votre lecture, Las Vegas parano vous laissera totalement éberlué comme après un soir de cuite.Un grand classique, un style, un vrai, à lire si ce n’est déjà fait !"

"895",894,"Jacinta","Loved it. In his depiction of chaos and insanity, Hunter S. Thompson shows himself to be a man who has a tight grip on human reality and society. Brilliantly written by a bit of a literary genius in my humble opinion."
"897",896,"ivoonaa","'We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a saltshaker half-full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers... Also, a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of beer, a pint of raw ether, and two dozen amyls. Not that we needed all that for the trip, but once you get locked into a serious drug collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can. The only thing that really worried me was the ether. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an ether binge, and I knew we'd get into that rotten stuff pretty soon.'"

"900",899,"Lee Scoresby","I kept waiting for something about the sports events he was supposed to be covering and never got it, but I did learn a lot about giant bats."
"901",900,"Charl","Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas centres around journalist Raoul Duke (based on Hunter S. Thompson), a sport writer who is tasked with heading to Las Vegas to report on the Mint 400 desert race. Given credit and free reign, Raoul hires a convertible and heads out to Sin City accompanied by his attorney, Dr Gonzo (based on Thompson’s friend, activist Oscar Zeta Acosta). However, they aren’t alone. Oh no. In the boot of their car is an eye-wateringly vast array of drugs. Everything from a salt shaker filled with cocaine, a pint of raw ether, uppers and downers, weed, obscene amounts of alcohol and pellets of mescaline to name but a few. Thompson pioneered “Gonzo journalism”, a style of writing where the author is at the heart of the first person narrative, giving an intensely personal and subjective viewpoint of an experience, rather than a distant, objective re-telling which is the norm in standard journalism. This mixture of fact and creative licence means that, in Thompson’s hands, we’re in for one hell of a ride. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a mash-up of a few Vegas trips which Thompson and Acosta themselves took. Using notes and tape recordings that he made at the time, Thompson crafted everything together and handed it to Rolling Stone magazine. The rest, as they say, is history. Published in the magazine in 1971 as a two part story, Gonzo journalism was born, as was one of the most iconic drug narratives ever published.As soon as I finished the book, I wrote down my initial feelings in a tweet. The sentence I used was: ‘One of the most crazy, trippy, funny, nonsensical and observant books I've read.’ Now, it’s been a few weeks since I closed the cover on Thompson’s most famous book; the dust has settled and I’ve had chance to mull things over. Do I still feel the same? Absolutely.It’s hard to quantify or even attempt to explain this book. Essentially, it’s 217 pages (give or take depending on your copy) of drug-fuelled narrative which often makes very little sense. It’s the epitome of excess; it’s depressing; it’s uplifting; it’s dark; it’s humorous; it’s confusing; it’s illuminating. Every possible conflicting thing you could think of, this book embodies. To be honest, attempting to rationalize or attach significant meaning to the story seems pretty fruitless and goes against the fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants style that the book adopts.Half of the time I had absolutely no clue what was going on, where I was up to or what exactly the characters were vocalizing, but I really couldn’t care less. That isn’t the point of the book; you aren’t truly meant to “understand”. We’re told that the main character is in a search for the American Dream, but the book ends up becoming a hazy rebellion in the face of the optimism and supposed possibility of said Dream. The Dream certainly isn’t present within the shady parts of Vegas, where drug binges, lawlessness and shady characters reign supreme. Through the significantly altered – OK, OK, he’s completely off his face - perceptions of Raoul Duke, you see the absurd nature of reality alongside a scathing retrospect on the culture of the 1960's.This is such a maverick book in terms of subject matter and style, firmly planting it in the ‘exceptionally risky’ category, but this risk completely and utterly pays off. For some readers it may be too abstract or may seemingly glorify anti-social and criminal behaviour, but Thompson successfully manages to encapsulate the tone of the late 1960's and early 1970's drug culture in the most descriptively flamboyant way. The book made me laugh countless times (like, REALLY laugh) and in amongst the seemingly incoherent nonsense there are some real jarring moments of genius and clarity.Overall: I guess the only way I can sum up Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is by reiterating the words I’ve already used: one of the most crazy, trippy, funny, nonsensical and observant books I’ve read.*This review has also been posted over at http://miscrawl.wordpress.com/"

"911",910,"Petra X","I read this years ago and reviewed it, but it seems to have disappeared from my booklist. Did I blot my copybook by slagging off the author's major drug and alcohol habits and thereby get it deleted or what? It's not like the author could object as a) he's dead and b) he was proud of his prodigious consumption of substances that got him off his head. Or was it just the GR monster, munching away, like a moth, holes here, holes there and you don't find them until you actually go looking?Whichever. Bastards.When I was very fired up about the censorships and deletions I wrote a 'review' and I'm wondering if I was more prescient than I realised?"

I remember saying something like 'I feel a bit lightheaded; maybe you should drive. . . .' And suddenly there was a terrible roar all around us and the sky was full of what looked like huge bats, all swooping and screeching and diving around the car, which was going about a hundred miles an hour with the top down to Las Vegas. And a voice was screaming 'Holy Jesus! What are these goddamn animals?""""But what was the story? Nobody had bothered to say. So we would have to drum up on our own. Free enterprise. The American Dream. Horatio Alger gone mad on drugs in Las Vegas. Do it now: pure Gonzo journalism.""""Good,' I said. 'But what about our room? And the golf shoes? We're right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo! And somebody's giving booze to these goddamn things! It won't be long before they tear us to shreds. Jesus look at the floor! Have you ever seen so much blood? How many have they killed already?' I pointed across the room to a group that seemed to be staring at us. 'Holy shit, look at that bunch over there! They've spotted us!""""By this time the drink was beginning to cut the acid and my hallucinations were down to a tolerable level. The room service waiter had a vaguely reptilian cast to his features, but I was no longer seeing huge pterodactyls lumbering around the corridors in pools of fresh blood.""And so many more."

Read in a bad mood, this cannot be read and you would probably leave it half way (or earlier). Arrgh, f*** it. I liked it and f*** you and your opinion. One toke over the line... Jesus...

Five years later? Six? It seems like a lifetime, or at least a main era... The kind of peak that never comes again. San Francisco in the middle sixties was a very special time and place to be a part of. Maybe it meant something, maybe not, in the long run. But no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time in the world. Whatever it meant. There was madness in any direction, at any hour. You could strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning.And that, I think, was the handle - that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of old and evil. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn't need that. Our energy would simply prevail. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave. So now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look west, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark - that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back. ""Its the story of a generation which took Tim Leary a bit too seriously..without knowing what lay in wait for them.Some years later when all the Hip part of the Hippiness had disappeared with LSD strictly off the streets , with no Woodstock, most people just grew out of it and went on to become a normal ""Working Class American"". and those who couldn't became ""Dr Gonzo"".The book's first hand Gonzo style takes you right into the head of a fiend hopelessly lost...with the ideas of peace and free love that he embraced all his life until then... The closing stanza beautifully summarizes the sad demise of the hippi culture as""We are all wired into a survival trip now. No more of the speed that fueled that 60's. That was the fatal flaw in Tim Leary's trip. He crashed around America selling ""consciousness expansion"" without ever giving a thought to the grim meat-hook realities that were lying in wait for all the people who took him seriously... All those pathetically eager acid freaks who thought they could buy Peace and Understanding for three bucks a hit. But their loss and failure is ours too. What Leary took down with him was the central illusion of a whole life-style that he helped create... a generation of permanent cripples, failed seekers, who never understood the essential old-mystic fallacy of the Acid Culture: the desperate assumption that somebody... or at least some force - is tending the light at the end of the tunnel""An excellent book for anyone who at some point in their lives have idolized Tim Leary...and wanted a ""REAL"" peek into the counterculture of the 60's "

"973",972,"Ashley  Pittman","WOW!!! is all i can say about this book. Hunter S. Thompson is the craziest genius of all time. and it does not hurt that he is from kentucky just like me haha! but anyway i had seen the movie a long time ago and thought it was a great film.but after reading the book i feel in love instantly, both movie and book are great in my opinion. the book is very easy to read and the way its detailed is amazing, you could actually feel like you were right there with them in ""Bat Country"" looking for the American dream, obliterated on every kind of dangerous drug known to man...I highly suggest this book to read for anyone with a weird since of humor like me. Its fun,adventurous,interesting,and crazy awesome......so by the ticket and take the ride!! I hope you enjoy as much as i did!"

"975",974,"Kerry Bogert","This is an amazing read. Thompson forms sentences brilliantly and takes his readers on a journey they would never expect to take.

"980",979,"Harry Guinness","Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas by Hunter S. Thompson is ridiculous, insane, and hilariously funny. Although a novel, it is based on the (hopefully exaggerated) events of Thompson and the attorney, Oscar Zeta Acosta. In short, Hunter and Acosta’s pseudonymous characters, Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo, go to Vegas with more drugs than a mid-sized pharmacy. Duke is there to report on two events, a motor race and a police conference; Dr. Gonzo is along for the ride. Drugs are consumed, repeatedly; hilarity ensues.Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is one of the best books I’ve read. In between detailing chemically induced hallucinations and the fallout from said hallucinations, Thompson takes cutting shots at everything from Vegas itself (“The Circus-Circus is what the whole hep world would be doing Saturday night if the Nazis had won the war.”) to his profession (“Journalism is not a profession or a trade. It is a cheap catch-all for fuckoffs and misfits — a false doorway to the backside of life, a filthy piss-ridden little hole nailed off by the building inspector, but just deep enough for a wino to curl up from the sidewalk and masturbate like a chimp in a zoo-cage.”) It is these interludes that make the book. While Thompson describing what it is like to stand in a hotel lobby hallucinating that everyone else is a lizard had me in stitches, it was the cutting interjections that made the book.Thompson shares a lot in common with Martin Amis (Money was one of my favourite books of last year). Both chronicle the chemically induced idiocy of questionable characters. Both use their novels, and wit, to comment on society as they see it. Both include themselves in the novel even! I’m really enjoying these darker books and will have to add more as some of the as-yet-undecided-novels I suspect. I have several more on the list including some Brett Easton Ellis. It will be interesting to see how I feel about them.If you haven’t read Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, do yourself a favour. Go. Read it. Now.Originally from Harry Guinness's blog."
"982",981,"Autumn","This book was hilarious. The book isn't about Hunter S. Thompson doing a report on motorcycles in Vegas, nor is it about a police drug convention in Vegas. It's about Thompson and his lawyer doing drugs while trying to do a report on motorcycles and police drug conventions in Vegas. They do so many drugs between the two of them that it is amazing they even survived, especially considering they were driving around for a good portion of the time. Mind you, if you have never done drugs or even been in a state where you might understand the effect of drugs (being drunk, being on heavy pain killers), then this book might not be quite so hilarious. Definitely a good book for a good laugh. And then watch the movie, Depp did a wonderful job with his portrayal of Thompson and the directing/screenwriting fit very well with the book, I would say."
"983",982,"Nate Carter","I pooped my pants about nine times reading this... It's the single greatest peice of journalistic creative non-fiction that I know of off-hand (Capote ain't got shit on Thompson). Words can't explain it. Drugs and adventure. That is all."
"985",984,"Sandra Kohler","Whether you agree with HST's lifestyle choices or not, it is impossible to deny that everything he did was done at full potential. He wrote, lived, and died as dramatically as he possibly could, and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is no exception. If any of the events in the story were fabricated, Thompson wrote them with such eloquence and in such detail that we will blindly believe them--and want with all our hearts to believe them--anyway.

"988",987,"Laurie Andres","It doesn't get any funnier, crazier, or more intense than this! My all-time favorite book (tied with Madame Bovary) is so funny even the tenth or twentieth read will have me in tears from laughing so hard.A masterpiece. "
"990",989,"Adam Scovell","Possibly my favourite book of all time. It's hard to believe that these were orginally read as articles in a magazine. It all fits together so well and cannot be given a compliment worthy enough with it being just so fantastic. Thompson paints an image of seventies America with such wit, bile and sheer imagination it's hard to believe a lot of it was based on true events. Chapters stay with you for days, weeks and in my case years after reading, I can still quote most of the first chapter off by heart..."
"991",990,"Patrick Roesle","The favorite book of anyone between the ages of 18-25 with a chaotic streak. Thompson at the height of his powers, before he got himself confused with his Raoul Duke alter ego and subsequently turned into a parody of himself. Of course, the book itself predicts this. There was no way that kind of trip could sustain itself.In this the novel is very tragic. But it is also absolutely hysterically funny.When the hilarious meets the tragic, when the beautiful meets the hideous, the place in which they intersect is the sublime."

"996",995,"Judy Owens","Sorry for the Arrogance of the Commonwealth, but only my native Kentucky could produce a writer with such a command of poverty and wealth, ignorance and brilliance, drug-saturated depravity and moral longing. All that with terrifically self-deprecating writing; what a New York Times reviewer described as having ""the clarity of a brain poised between brilliance and burnout."" Thompson was the Bluegrass iconoclast, Mark Twain with a head full of ether and acid. Fear and Loathing is a classic."

"1003",1002,"Debra","Hilarious, intelligent, challenging book. Must Read"
"1004",1003,"Patrick Faulkner","Another dusty tome on my shelf I recently reread. What a time capsule of the early 70s when getting wasted was a radical act! But Thompson somehow draws out of that era of self-indulgence an existential saga, like ""On the Road"" through the other end of the telescope. He shows how the idealism of the 60s washed into the ""Age of Narcissism"" and the ""Me Generation"", when the only response to a right-wing ugly world was to get trashed. Tom Wolfe (another very funny satirist) also saw it coming, as did the whole Gonzo crew. Take it as the satire it was meant to be, as I once met Thompson in Sydney & he told me that if he had done all that stuff on that journey, he'd have been dead."
"1005",1004,"Star Valdez","My suggestion read this on a plane. I like to read this book next to stuffy ole' business types. I can't help but laugh aloud, and snort. FUNNY FUNNY FUNNY!"
"1008",1007,"Luke Meehan","Wonderful. I really don't care how 'gonzo' this was; to be dropped without softening into someone's drug-fuelled memories of a supremely strange weekend is a brilliant experience. The perfect fantasizing novel for the squarest of hipsters. "
"1009",1008,"Luke Zaphir","Non linear storytelling with a stark and darkly humoured view of the remnants of the American Dream. The amoral hijinks of Hunter and his attorney are crude, subtle, angry, morose and depict a disquiet about the world they live in.Definitely the best of Hunter's books - after this point, he gets angrier with no recourse. This is the height of his humour and depravity"
"1010",1009,"Annette Vaillancourt","Crazy, gonzo reading!"
"1011",1010,"Eddie","Reading this again. Still mourning his departure, in a way. Given his, uh, personal history, it's surprising he remained a writer for so long. But what a talent. His prose is compact, visceral, and mournful all at once. "
"1012",1011,"Theresa Lewis","I read this years ago after seeing the film first. The film is pretty high up on my list of favorites, and so is the book. Hunter S. Thompson was just so unique and intriguing, creating his own 'style' of journalism which I always wished I could have attempted to try myself! The way he puts sentences together in metaphor are just spectacular, and I love that its so effectively conveyed in the film as well. "
"1015",1014,"Ryan Trimble","A middle finger to ""the American dream"" whilst chasing the American dream. The irony and wit had me pissing my pants.

"1022",1021,"Steven Rage","From the opening passage, to the bitter end, Hunter Thompson's masterpiece, had me completely encased. This was so much like how I felt when reading Hemingway's 'A Sun Also Rises'. I was so blown away by both these books that I immediately gobbled up everything by Thompson and Hemingway I could find, with pretty much the same results: these two books were the best of the lot. With the exception of Thompson's 'Hell's Angels' (which was kickass) the rest of their work left me cold and flat. Even so, I became enamored with their personas. So much so, it became interesting enough to read about them, versus anymore of their work. But it matters not. Even if Fear and Loathing was the only book Thompson penned, he could have died a proud man. FALILV is that good. Life altering and amazing and with the rarity of the movie being JUST AS GOOD....I highly encourage devouring them both!"

"1042",1041,"Felicia","I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I had seen the movie several times and one day while browsing my local bookstore, saw it and thought it would be an interesting read. I was pleasantly surprised by how similar the book and movie are. There is very little that happens in the book and not he movie and the progression is spot on. I realized while reading this book that I really didn't know what Hunter S. Thompson is actually saying in the movie most of the time. Reading it however, helps you really decipher, although not fully understand, his drug induced babbling and inner dialogue. I wouldn't, however, suggest this book to people who like to read books that are made into film with the expectation that the book is going to be better. If you're a bigger fan of watching things rather than reading you're better off watching the movie. "

"1044",1043,"Chris Dahlgren","I really liked this book because it showed a lot of views of society. It shows you what a typical 60's 70's cop attitude is like and what a low life druggy thinks. The book takes place in Las Vegas where a reporter and his attorney go to cover the mint 400 a bike race and and to write about the American dream. They bring along with them a briefcase filled with enough drugs to look like an evidence locker. They take all of these wacky drugs a lot you probably havn't heard of and go off and talk about their crazy adventures in Vegas and all the troubles they get into. It is written very well and is not the easiest to read because you have to know when they are talking about real life or when they are experiencing a trip. The writer also uses a very complex vocabulary to properly explain each situation with good detail. "

"1055",1054,"Chris Hitsman","The best thing about this book is it really is the crowning achievement of Gonzo Journalism. Thompson said it was a failure, but doesn’t seem to realize that he combined fiction style structures and creative freedom with fast paced and straight to the point journalism. We travel with journalist Rauol Duke and his attorney, Dr. Gonzo, through their decadent adventures throughout Vegas and into what they believe is their generation’s American Dream. After an insane drug filled day and night, Rauol wakes up to find Dr. Gonzo gone. He flips and starts to head back to L.A., only to get pulled over by a policeman who tells him to go and sleep as a rest stop before he continues his drive. Overly paranoid, he ends up calling Dr. Gonzo who informs him he must return to Vegas immedietly to start the whole journey over again. Only this time, he will be disenchanted by visiting the National District Attorneys Association's Conference on Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs while under the influence of mind altering substances. Both these events really happened, but over a much larger time span. Epically ironic and hilarious, this piece brings to life Thompson’s unreal decadence through the freedom of a fictional framework."

"1058",1057,"Chinstrapmcdouchebag","read this book? great, now you've seen the grand total of everything road movies, buddy movies, and embellished trip stories can cover and you never need to pay any attention to those generally dull genres again."
"1061",1060,"Infecteddaemon","The sublime object of the ""American Dream"" is achieved by our good ""Doctor in Journalism"" in this eccentric book. Many people flout the term  American Dream  without really understanding it's full implications. I will be the first to recognize that no one can really pin down the meaning of such a thing, but the fundamental aspects of it we can all agree upon: It entails absolute liberty to the point of it's abuse (interestingly enough, there is no word for this in the English language... looks like the anglophone people hold there liberty close to heart; in Spanish we have the term ""libertinaje"" that has no direct translation, basically meaning abuse of liberty.)You don't need to understand the hallucinatory imagery to actually appreciate the book. Having previous experience with drugs and there effects are not required; but having first hand experience will make the images more lively and credible, yes, the stuff described really happens. Hunter describes in great detail the feeling of 'Metacognition' and paranoia, dysmetria and hallucinations.But we are forgetting one thing, the book isn't about that!This book is the flag-ship for Gonzo Journalism! The writing style is very polished and makes for an easy read (I wouldn't expect anything less from a doctor in Journalism.) Anyone that isn't immediately offended by the whole possibility of the use of illicit substances can enjoy the book and it's hilarious ramblings.The whole concept that the book can open your eyes to the dark underbelly of ""the true america!"" are just misinformed, premature and read too much into the text. This is just a good story. A fun page turner. Enjoy."
"1062",1061,"Michael Houghton","Made no sense from start to finish. Loved it!"
"1063",1062,"Suncerae","A literary search for the American dream, or a ""gross, physical salute to the fantastic possibilities of life in this country"". Raoul Duke and his attorney, Dr. Gonzo, explore freedom of press, motorcycle races in the desert, the chance that anybody can win big in Las Vegas or life, and the ability to escape it all with drugs, even surrounded by cops during an anti-drug convention. Las Vegas itself has blossomed into such an overblown cesspool of extravagance that Raoul's surreal acid-ether hallucinations of dead grandmothers and two women fucking a polar bear doesn't seem too far fetched. You don't need psychedelics when you can walk into a casino day or night and see what Las Vegas has to offer. If the American dream is real, the reader is left with a feeling that it's something unattainable, a lifestyle that looks good on the outside but built on perversions. What kind of a nation sentences Muhammad Ali to 5 years of prison and strips him of his heavyweight title for refusing to participate in the Vietnam war, while a drugged out madman in Vegas can collect 600 bars of translucent Neutrogena soap in one night?Fifty years later, it's easy to forget that the failed counter-culture of the 1960's heavily shaped the American sensibility of apathy that pervades our society today. There was once a movement where victory over old and evil felt imminent, that the momentum of the young generation promised a better future. Unfortunately, the movement ended, and self-preservation still rules supreme today.Fear and Loathing is serious commentary on the nature of what it means to be an American, but you barely notice the satire because of it's funny, accurate, sugar-coated hallucinogenic acid trip. Masterfully crafted by one of the 20th century greats."
"1064",1063,"Amber Isaacs","“Too weird to live, too rare to die!”I think this quote perfectly establishes the two views of this book. There doesn't seem to be many mid range thoughts regarding a reader's experience with this odd and frighteningly honest book. So on one hand you have those who don't enjoy it, don't enjoy the plot, or more so the lack of. They don't like the characters, see their existence as miserable and unappealing as they chug their way through a whole pharmacy's worth of drugs and alcohol (and grapefruits). The don't appreciate the wit and often desolate state of mind of these characters and treat the whole novel as fictitious, because quite frankly the book is just ""too weird.""But then you have the other side of the coin. Those who read this weird book and at first glance perhaps feel the way the others feel. It is to begin with a book that drops you right in the middle of a journey somewhere, but it isn't the journey to Las Vegas. It is a journey through life and perception that doesn't start at the first page and end at the last page, but rather gives you a snapshot of the mind of the author.It is fantastically descriptive, as good as any romantic poet, but has the satirical wit of the classical authors. While the plot may seem basic and repetitive, it is naive to simply judge it based on that. It is a study of character, a grand play about relationship and self discovery without ever really explicitly talking about either. It creates it's own movie in your head, a fast paced action with tense moments cluttered by bizarre happenings that isn't distracting, but funny (realised all the more when actually watching the movie).It is also littered with statements that are so true and real that it becomes a moment of pure clarity in a book so outrageous:“In a closed society where everybody's guilty, the only crime is getting caught. In a world of thieves, the only final sin is stupidity.”Thompson has hidden these gems of life talk within this hugely overwhelming book. What annoys me is that people are so eager to disregard it but are happy to pluck truth nuggets out of science fiction or fantasy based books. What is the difference? That the subject matter in this is so close to reality but with a sense of impossible proportion that it cannot possibly aim to enlighten, but rather wants to shame those like the characters? This is simply not true. It is negligent to think that this is in any way a self contained book, Thompson is not a self contained author. No one who can so easily write like this can ever be contained. It far surpasses any known notion of politically correct writing, and instead uses that shock factor to subliminally suggest certain truths, such as the line above about our guilty society. It is a book that deserves time for reflection. I have given myself time to digest this book in the hope of coming to a succinct final remark regarding it. Succinct was not what I achieved, but I don't believe this to be a bad thing. There is too much going on in this book, contrary to what some may think. Any book that so perfectly comments on society cannot be succinct, because society is not a contained concept. So by that belief, a review cannot be succinct either. Perhaps this is just rambling, perhaps I have succumbed to the nonsense spraffed in this book. Won't the ""too weird"" collective rejoice to have proof of the effect this book can have on the feeble minded?As I see it though, I am happy to stand among those who see the true merit of this book, who appreciate that there is so much more going on, or even those who don't read beneath the surface but simply enjoy it as a radical tale of debauchery. I stand among these people, because this book surely is too rare to let die. "
"1070",1069,"Kaliska","Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey into the Heart of the American Dream is a fairly surreal and exceedingly maddening book, and due to that, one that oft puts people off from reading it through to its completion. The heavy drug use makes the writings sometimes seem like their going off on their own tangents, whilst somehow staying true to the story and true to the scenarios that are playing out across the pages at the time.The shifts in time, though you may not be consciously aware of the fact that they've occurred, don't throw the person reading out the book as some do. They flow in an actually coherent form, yet when reading, it does eventually occur to one that they really shouldn't be able to follow some supposedly drug-addled and jumbled mess of a piece of writing as well as they are. At least, I never found myself to be lost. Some people may find themselves in a different boat though, I suppose.Some rather gorgeous yet off-putting illustrations crop up sporadically throughout the book, and certain pages seem to have been marred by someone dribbling ink over them (of course, not over the text in any way), and though it seems almost childish in nature, it really does add to the surreality of the reading experience, and acted as a guideline for the creating of the visual aspect of the film.Note: The movie adaptation is brilliant, and completely under-appreciated. Terry Gilliam does an amazing job with the visuals, as is to be expected, and both Depp and del Toro are amazing actors, bringing both Thompson and Gonzo to life in a truly breath-taking way. Also, there's one particular scene in a flashback where the cameo makes you stumble, but in the best way possible."

I even rooted for Ellis’ Patrick Bateman as he tried to annihilate the society he lived in, a society that he tried so hard to fit into.Now, I wasn’t old enough to remember much from the late 60’s early 70’s let alone the political aspects of Nixon’s presidency or the drug culture of the time, so this review won’t have any profound social or political commentary, except that comparisons can well be made to the drug culture of today, and it’s glaringly apparent that not much has changed except for the chemical constituents.Considering the climate of the time: Nixon’s presidency, the war in Vietnam, and the country’s young men succumbing to the draft, it was no wonder that an entire generation wanted something more, for this was not the American Dream they had been sold. Sound familiar? And for some, the only way to drown out the hypocrisy gnawing at their brains was to give their brains an escape. Expand your mind, as that might be the only part of you that truly is free. Whatever it takes to get you directly out of your head – the higher the better. This story chronicles a journey utterly devoid of restraint and reason, as these two men, Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo, and their trunk full of felonies set themselves loose on Las Vegas – to them, the last vestige of the American dream. However, their idea of the American Dream is not how most of us would understand it, but somehow, through the fog of hallucinatory metaphor, we can actually see and feel what the main characters are searching for so desperately.All that aside, even if the 60’s sub-culture is beyond your age group, Thompson’s writing is worth the read. It’s brilliant, sarcastic, and frighteningly absurd: Bars seething with has-been lounge lizards, tearing the patrons to shreds; blood soaked tacky hotels rooms; police car chases; kidnapping; gambling; excess; and debauchery … not to mention the Narcotics convention. The dialog is brilliant written, and through the drug haze, we get offered a media-spinless clarity, a clarity that can only be articulated by the truly disenchanted. Harrowing and ludicrous experiences abound: it’s amazing that the two main characters manage to make it out of Vegas alive, san the straightjackets.Definitely a wild ride for all. The movie was quite good as well, but it lacks some of the subtleties that can only found in the written word. Thompson’s word: ""But our trip was different. It was to be a classic affirmation of everything right and true in the national character. A gross physical salute to the fantastic possibilities of life in this country. But only for those with true grit. We are all wired into a survival trip now. No more of the speed that fueled the 60's. That was the fatal flaw in Tim Leary's trip. He crashed around America selling ""consciousness expansion"" without ever giving a thought to the grim meat-hook realities that were lying in wait for all the people who took him seriously... All those pathetically eager acid freaks who thought they could buy Peace and Understanding for three bucks a hit. But their loss and failure is ours too. What Leary took down with him was the central illusion of a whole life-style that he helped create... a generation of permanent cripples, failed seekers, who never understood the essential old-mystic fallacy of the Acid Culture: the desperate assumption that somebody... or at least some force - is tending the light at the end of the tunnel.”"
"1119",1118,"Ashlin","Really enjoyed this book. Made me very interested in Hunter S. Thompson."
"1122",1121,"Wyatt"," In Hunter S. Thompson's ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" it relates a crazy, drug filled trip to Las Vegas. The entirety of the book is filled with drug references and not once in the book, does it seem that the characters are not under the influence of some extreme, illegal drug. The story begins with two characters who are assigned to report a Las Vegas motorcycle and dirt bike race across the desert and then turns into a crazy drug trip where the story isn't even reported on. Later on, oddly enough, they are assigned to report on a Drug Enforcement Agency meeting. Many readers would think that these two men sobered up for this where in fact they are on as many drugs as before. This book really illustrates the dangers of drugs and the negative side effects of them. For example, in the beginning of the book as the man character is driving he believes he is being swarmed by bats, where it actually turns out to be the drugs. I enjoyed this book very much and found it very hard to put down. The book itself is based on a true story of the author. The main character is Hunter S. Thompson and depicts his time covering the race and doing all of these various drugs. One quote I found very graphic relating to drugs was, ""A drug person can learn to cope with things like seeing their dead grandmother crawling up their leg with a knife in her teeth. But no one should be asked to handle this trip."" One this quote shows the extremes of drugs and secondly it shows the amount of drugs the characters were on during the entirety of the book. I would recommend this book to everybody as it is very captivating. "
"1125",1124,"Chuck Pratt","The Good Doctor’s magnum opus is one of the most incredible and entertaining books ever written. Both visceral and intellectual, this book is indeed a “Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream”, as its subtitle indicates. Fear and Loathing is ‘gonzo’ writing at its finest and most pure; it tells the depraved, semi-autobiographical story of journalist Raul Duke and his lawyer Dr. Gonzo as they trek through Las Vegas during one of Duke’s assignments as a field journalist during the waning years of the Counterculture movement of the late 60s and early 70s; all the while these two depraved, insightful individuals are ingesting massive amounts of illegal narcotics and other drugs. The ‘Wave Speech’ is, in my estimation, one of the greatest passages ever penned. As an added bonus, the movie adaptation compares favorably to the book."

"1146",1145,"Brian Hart","This book was of course insane!! I really loved it ... it read like fiction cause it was so crazy. This was a book that I kept thinking about when I wasn't reading it and I wanted to constantly make time to finish it... and that hasn't happened to this degree in a while.I have to say at times it made me want to do drugs for the shear excitement of being completely out of control and insane, but most of the time it made me glad that I don't do them... this was close enough for me!=)"
"1149",1148,"Oboudreaux","It's amazing what can spill from the human mind. Strike that. It's amazing what the human mind can produce through a chemical haze and then later embellish on, most likely also through a chemical haze. Much more continuity then Burroughs."

Still humping the American dream.""The juxtaposition of these two freaks, in the freak kingdom.5/5"
"1161",1160,"Jeff Yoak","I enjoyed revisiting this book tremendously. Thompson's elegant use of language combined with this disjointed and obviously heart-felt tale is completely engaging. I was amazed at how many quotes from the book I had memorized! My tastes are a lot less similar to those of the characters than they were the last time I read this, but going through the book again almost drops me back into old states of mind."

"1175",1174,"MiLi","El libro relata algunos días en la vida de un periodista (el propio Hunter Thompson bajo un pseudónimo) que es convocado a Las Vegas para realizar la cobertura de un evento deportivo. En el viaje, lo acompaña su abogado y una valija repleta de drogas de todo tipo (anfetaminas, marihuana, merca, mescalina, y varias cosas más). Tanto él como su abogado transcurren los días bajo los efectos alucinógenos, estimulantes o relajantes (dependiendo de las drogas que consumen sin parar) cometiendo todo tipo de fraudes y papelones en un relato que muestra la decadencia de la cultura en norteamérica en los '60 y '70 con la Guerra de Vietnam como tema de fondo. El consumismo, la superficialidad, la contracultura y el anarquismo son los tópicos centrales que toma esta novela para hacer reflexionar al lector sobre el estereotipo del ""sueño americano"". Es un libro inteligente, con geniales descripciones que te hacen poner en piel del personaje que cuenta la historia.Psicodelia en estado puro. "

"1180",1179,"Stefan","Probably the best opening scene of a book - already at full throttle, Thompson tosses the reader into the back seat of the convertible and you, like him, have bought a ticket and are about to take the ride of your life. So many good quotes, so many unforgettable scenes. This book came along at the right moment in my life and made a lasting impression..one of my favorite reads. "
"1181",1180,"G.T. Almasi","Astoundingly hilarious and grotesque. This is one of the two books that got me to start writing books (the other is Snow Crash). I discovered Fear and Loathing with some friends back in high school (way-y-y long time ago) and we still quote lines from it to each other. Then I brought it to college and it happened again with the people I met there. One of my college buds opens many of our conversations with, ""As your lawyer, I advise you to...""I pick this up and flip it through when I'm having a bad day. It's like anti-depressants in print.Five stars, hell, I'd give it a million stars if I could. Not for everyone, but still my highest recommendation."

"1183",1182,"Garrett Burnett","This is the drug-addled rambling of a reporter sent twice to Las Vegas to cover various stories. He spends the entire time high and destroying property. It's crude and vulgar, but it's an awful lot of fun. It's completely entertaining to hear the narrator and his ""attorney"" try to sort through their paranoid delusions and interact with sober folks. Thompson's greatest strength is his ability to expose his characters' lines of reasoning that accompany each decision. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is like a whacked-out version of On the Road. Note: As much as I liked the mad-cap zaniness, I recognize that not everyone will share my enthusiasm. Don't be blinded by the 5 stars."

"1186",1185,"noah herrera","""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" by Hunter S. Thompson is an autobiographical novel about Raoul Duke and his adventure to Las Vegas with his attorney Gonzo while on a trunk full of drugs and alcohol. Originally they went to participate in the Mint 400 dessert race, but switch courses to experiment with an almost endless supply of drugs. Throughout the story they continue to mention that they are in search for “The American Dream”. They have intense hallucinations while they are in public so they retreat to their hotel room and continue to do drugs. During these times Hunter Thompson was one of the few journalist to write about these kinds of events and his writing style.This book didn’t relate directly to our discussion topic, but it shows how some of the culture was in the 60s and how their planned out road trip to Las Vegas turned into something completely different. The other books we read related in the same way how things didn't go as planned but there was still something gained. They gained a different experience than they were not expecting. This book was really good. It was funny, surprising, entertaining and The story jumps in and out of reality with out any warnings and you never know what is going to happen next. This book was much more different than the books I read before. It seemed really honest and Hunter Thompson really told it all. His writing was like naturally speaking and not everything was written perfectly. I enjoyed this book and would like to read some of Hunter Thompsons other books."
"1187",1186,"Sarbjit","Don't read this book whilst travelling on the bus as you will want to laugh out loud and right thinking members of the public will think you are strange. If the public think you are strange then you really are done for!"

"1219",1218,"Dkolacinski","""We were somewhere around Barslow on the edge of the desert when the drugs began to take hold."" I long for the innocence of 1971, where reality could be interchanged with hallucinations. If Hunter were still alive today, how would he write about today? Those hallucinations turned out to be real. He ended his life voluntarily, the years having taken their toll. He wasn't a good man. He wasn't a pleasant man. But these aren't good or pleasant times. A few years after the publication of the book, I attended an intense week-long seminar with someone who had spent an intense week-end with HST in Lubbock TX. What you read here is what he experienced there. Too bad there wasn't a ""Fear and Loathing in Lubbock Texas"" with Buddy Holly playing in the background. Nah, the soundtrack for HST will always be the Stones."
"1222",1221,"Rod Glenn","A true classic in every way."
"1223",1222,"Derek Ellsworth","What wonderful madness!!! This book is the complete embodiment of free will if there ever was one. Thompson and his 'attorney' go on one adventure after another to what seems like another dimension yet they are right there in Vegas the whole time. The 'wave' speech is famous, but there's many other gems in this funhouse. I loved the Johnny Depp movie as well. Many say it's hard to watch or follow, but for most of the civilized world it's hard to understand why anyone would want to put them or their bodies through all this....yet like the greatest scientists and explorers of ages past, Thompson had no fear and went places that few will ever go."
"1226",1225,"Ted Thomson","It's either loved or despised but I thoroughly enjoyed every second of psychotic,psychedelic, drug fuelled chaos that ensued. This book to me is, whilst totally irresponsible, irreverent and not for the faint at heart, a travel novel at heart. A documentation of a sick, disturbing and twisted road-trip whilst on the way detailing gonzo journalism and the cluelessness of the authorities on narcotics. At certain points in the novel I felt sickened and angered at Thompson's and his attorneys behaviour and whilst he is a definitive anti-hero, you are left wondering. Why didn't he die? "

"1231",1230,"David Schumacher","A bold book, Thompson has a very interesting writing style that keeps you interested even though sometimes he can be very subjective and unless youve seen the movie a few times, its kind of hard to seperate reality from his subjective drug fueled adventures. That aside, its a great read."

"1233",1232,"Josephine","I first fell in love with ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" as a sophomore at Michigan State while on a trip with my mom and her friends, all of them part of the hippie culture of the 70s. They were gleefully quoting passages to crack each other up and when they found out I had no clue what they were talking about, they begged me to read it. From the first page, I was hooked and found myself randomly bursting into fits of laughter. To keep up with this insane tale is a treat and I have found myself reading it again and again over the years, which eventually lead me to other gems, such as ""Hell's Angels"". Thompson was such a great talent, if you haven't read any of his stuff, this is the place to start."
"1234",1233,"Ed","I thoroughly enjoyed this book and found it absolutely hilarious! Hunter S. Thompson and his attorney spend a drugs-filled weekend in Las Vegas and it left me laughing, shaking my head and disbelief and just wondering what the hell they were going to get up to next. There's not really so much to say about this one, but I had a lot of fun reading it."

"1240",1239,"Jenne Lorraine","As good a read now as it was when I was 16 and knew the subburban banality that surrounded me had to just be the encasing for a juicy life sausage. This book sears, soars and soaks in it's own drippings and all I can say is YUM."
"1242",1241,"Kalen","Another favorite. The movie is just as good (if you like the book). Very far out there, but it is very fitting for the time in which he wrote it."

"1244",1243,"Keegan Evans","Goddammit you bastards! This book makes and breaks rules."
"1245",1244,"Reverend","My very favorite book! A lot of people say its a drug book but they are wrong. What else was there to do when all of the dreams were dashed, your country was still at war, and you had Nixon as president?This book is a tribute to the ultimate demise of the 60s and an attempt at an explanation of the stagnation and intellectual rolling back of the 70s. Unbelievably enough, Thompson is able to sum this all up in a matter of a 4 sentence paragraph! "

"1251",1250,"Mitchell","I really loved this, which I wasn't expecting too. I haven't seen the movie, and all I knew about the book was that it was a semi-autobiography detailing the drug-addled adventures of an acid-soaked writer during one week in Vegas. I was dubious as to how entertaining that might be. I needn't have worried.I'm not sure how closely the story correlates to real life, but essentially, Thompson (as his alter ego Raoul Duke) is sent to Las Vegas to cover a racing tournament, and brings along his gigantic Samoan attorney who is as much of an irredeemable basehead as he is. The duo spend a week roaring around Vegas in a red convertible, the trunk containing enough drugs to ""kill an entire platoon of United States Marines,"" and essentially bare their asses at every law they find. They trash hotel rooms, terrify hitchhikers, and infiltrate a police convention on drug crimes, all while speeding off their heads and hallucinating about ""huge pterodactyls lumbering around the corridors in pools of fresh blood"" or ""two women fucking a polar bear."" The sense of an alternately fascinating and horrifying seven day drug trip is perfectly supplemented by Ralph Steadman's grotesque, blotchy illustrations, scattered throughout the book (my only complaint is that the scenes they depict usually occurred about twelve pages ago).You'd imagine that two hundred pages of acid trips would grow old fast, but Thompson's skill as a writer is such that it maintains its lustre all the way through. Raoul Duke is one of those loveable characters who lives purely on fanatical, reckless impulse, with no consequences to either his freedom or health. Any real person who took the amount of drugs Raoul and his attorney do would be dead in seconds and probably also find themselves immortalised as an oddity in a journal of medicine. Likewise, a brush with the law and twenty years in prison would also be inevitable; unlike the health consequences, however, Thompson sweats over this with constant paranoia. Fortunately for the reader, he has a great sense of humour about it all.My favourite quote, on the topic of highway police:""No cop was ever born who isn't a sucker for a finely-executed high-speed Controlled Drift all the way around one of those cloverleaf freeway interchanges.""The place of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas as a watershed moment in twentieth century culture was deservedly won. There's a whole slew of themes and messages in this book, which Thompson described as a ""vile epitaph for the drug culture of the sixties,"" but I was enjoying it too much to bother thinking about them. Fundamentally, it's just an exhilerating, high-octane journey through the neon lights, vomit-streaked hotel rooms and warped culture of 1971 Las Vegas. A hell of a toboggan ride!"
"1252",1251,"Kyle Schnitzer","Awesome. "
"1255",1254,"Josephus FromPlacitas","The classic, although I'm beginning to suspect it's almost a little over-read at this point. You don't need me to tell you about it."

Everyone imagines themselves trying to survive the lights and the people and the driving and the bats while on a plethora of drugs they've probably never tried before. This book makes people want to be carefree and buy a briefcase and be a writer and own guns and blaze across the desert, but even if they tried they would never do it quite like Hunter."
"1270",1269,"Collin Katrell","This was a pretty fun read. I like how erratic and witty Mr. Thompson is in this book. Probably my favorite book written by him. I've looked into other books of his and none of them seemed as exciting as this one was."

"1272",1271,"dana","This book shaped my desire to start re-reading again. It pointed me in the direction of gonzo/transgressive fiction that is really my favorite fiction genre. People on the edge, outsiders who are insiders in their own world.Hunter sent me looking for characters who I could relate to - the big fish in their respective odd ponds. Characters who don't dare to be different, but just plainly are - which is why we are attracted and repulsed all at once.I read this as part of a modern Lit course with the koolest prof I think ever existed. She looked and dressed like J.Garaffalo in Reality Bites and I wanted to take her home so that I could talk about what I felt was real writing. That class was one of the best decisions I had ever made for myself at 18 whose trickle down effect has made me a more interesting reader."

"1283",1282,"Julien V","J'ai changé d'opinion finalement... c'était juste trop intense et trippant - et drôle et méchant et intelligent vers la fin. Un classique, même si c'est à la fois plus ""adolescent"" et moins politique que je ne le croyais."

"1287",1286,"Lucie","The first time I saw the movie I was a bit confused, especially since Johny Depp was in it... Fell in love with the movie the second and third time I watched it. In the passed few years Ive watched about 100 times now and still cant stop. Finally Ive come to read the book. I can honestly only say the best things about this. It has some more scenes and Dukes ramblings in it than the movie, but all in all the movie reflects it almost perfectly. This crazy nihilistic drug-riddled ride is much recommended! "

The truth he puts into his books about drugs and alcohol can really put someone's perspective on the subject whether good or bad. His adventures are well written and makes you feel part of the memories he delicately illustrates."
"1294",1293,"Breanne Sorrells","This book can hardly be awarded less than five stars because who am I to judge it? I believe Thompson has done a good of job as anything yes? An excellent stream of consciousness and now I have no desire for LSD. Far better than the film, of course."

After 50 years, another great novelist wrote about the American Dream (not by chance he loved Fitzgerald). And it turned into a parody, as well as for '60s drug culture.A hallucinatory analysis of the American dream, twisted but lucid. HST swallows in one blow the beatniks, Bukowski and those who came before him. This man was weird, but when the going gets weird, the weird turn pro."

"1304",1303,"Zee","""We were somewhere around Barstow when the drugs began to take hold. I remember saying something like 'I feel lighteheaded; maybe you should drive...'""And so the journey begins; a journey of two drug-addled men, nay, two of 'god's very own prototypes' shrieking wildly in a red convertible christened the 'Great Red Shark', driving at break-neck speed through the unforgiving Las Vegas desert, straight for the mirage that is 'The American Dream'. There it was; shimmering playfully in front of them, always just out of reach. Yet they drive anyway, hell-bent on grasping a tendril of it. Little do they know that what they end up doing is creating their own dream. A sick, twisted psychedelic nightmare whose birth mother was drugs and its father pure Gonzo journalism. Hailed as a cult classic, this savage journey is loosely based on Hunter S. Thompson (aka Raoul Duke, aka self-proclaimed Doctor of Journalism) and Oscar Zeta Acosta (aka Dr. Gonzo - the attorney) and their never-to-be-repeated-one-of-a-kind expedition to the limits of human endurance.""Oh mama... could this really be the end???""Initially the journey begins as a serious journalism assignment to cover the Mint 400; a race across the desert consisting of dune buggies, custom motorcycles and unsavoury biker types. ""The only way to prepare for a trip like this, I felt, was to dress up like human peacocks and get crazy, then screech off across the desert and cover the story. Never lose sight of the primary responsibility.""However the objective of the operation soon degenerates to an orgyistic mish-mash of circus casinos, dwarfs with pink telephones, trashed hotel rooms and bad, bad trips. Very soon our two anti-protagonists end up drowning in a cesspool of their own making, trying to make sense of a world that really shouldn't make sense, but somehow does. Fear and Loathing isn't for the faint hearted. Thompsons prose has a savage, animalistic vein to it; the mindless antics, a ritualistic mode which speaks of a desperate cleansing of the system. The things that happen in this book are foul, lawless and downright immoral, but it's one hell of a laugh. ""Every now and then when your life gets complicated and the weasels start closing in; the only real cure is to load up on heinous chemicals and then drive like a bastard from Hollywood to Las Vegas.""My verdict is 5/5 stars. Holy Mother of God... 'Fear and Loathing' was some ride. After reading it, I know that things will never be the same again. Because you know when you've been Gonzo'd."
"1305",1304,"Benjamin Sobieck","If you need this review to decide whether to read HST's classic, ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,"" then you need to stop reading reviews about this book. This is the place to start to get into my favorite author. Although I think his political narratives showcase his brilliance better, this masterpiece of ""Gonzo journalism"" is what made the man into the myth."
"1306",1305,"Alex Bowman","	The book Fear and Loathing is a great account by Hunter S. Thompson of his adventures with his attorney through the Las Vegas desert and the strip. I believe his main purpose for this book is to publically document his travels and quirky mishaps that happened along the way. They had documented part of this book by also using some of their recording equipment for interviews so Hunter used his Gonzo journalism skills to further apply his stories in print. The intended audience for this book is probably anyone who wants to learn about the finest example of Gonzo journalism, or someone who just wants a short narrative written in a way where the mood of the 60's and 70's are reflected by the actions of the counterculture through drugs.	The theme for the book is an autobiographical account of Raoul Duke(Hunter S. Thompson's name for the book) and his Samoan attorney Dr. Gonzo. They are on the quest to find the American dream, fueled by the use of many hard drugs like LSD, mescaline, and other crazy substances. Raoul is in Vegas covering the Mint 400 race. They, on the quest for the American dream, by meeting interesting individuals and ruining good convertibles. It's also good to mention that it's hard to distinguish between what is fake and what is real, based on the hallucinogenic side effects of the drug.	The style the book is written in is called Gonzo journalism, which is a firsthand account of the story, which generally has more untrue elements than facts. In the case of this book, I can believe that a lot more stuff happened that isn't necessarily legal, but I think the elements to racy for the book were cut out for a good reason. I personally believe his method of delivering the story in this way is much better than in a first person narrative mainly due to the effect it has on the author, their audience, and the delivery of the story.	I personally love this book. The accounts of Hunter S. Thompson have always been something I've wanted to read and this has been considered the best of his work by other critics. I personally found the tales to be entertaining because of their strangeness based on the hallucinogenic and general atmosphere. I can't really think of much I dislike about it besides the movie adaptation, which was a disaster. Other than that, it's a very well written avant-garde style book."
"1307",1306,"Tim Bohmert","I have been looking forward to this read and it did not disappoint. Unlike any other book I have read before. Really seems to put you in the characters mindset/intoxication. "
"1308",1307,"Amy Adler","Las Vegas is kinda like this even when you're stone cold sober."
"1309",1308,"Keytrice Castro","Hunter S. Thompson’s “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas” is one of my favorite books, mainly because it blurred the distinctions between writer and subject, fiction and nonfiction. He is the creator of gonzo journalism, which is a style of journalism that’s usually written through first-person narrative. Even though the book was edited, it gives off more of a brash, unpolished feel to the style of writing, which in my opinion, is what makes the story—journalism should be a real, as-is type of writing, even if it’s fiction. Direct quotes, sarcasm, humor, exaggeration, and especially profanity are common with gonzo journalism, and it seems like you can’t get enough of that in “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas”…you know, on top of all the drugs and recklessness."
"1310",1309,"Dwayne Ackley","A Classic book. If you don't like Drug-inspired prose, you should probably pass on this one. Hunter S Thompson pushes the envelope ingesting drugs and trying his best to miss his deadline."

"1320",1319,"Dustin Gaughran","I don't think I can say anything about this book that hasn't already been said. Fans of Hunter S. are fans regardless of what anyone else says. But if you aren't a fan, I would still fancy a guess that you'd enjoy 'Fear and Loathing', if for no other reason than it's funny, slightly absurd, and very original."
"1324",1323,"Austin Chatillon-reed","Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas is a vulgar yet pleasing book. Hunter S. Thompson galavants around Las Vegas under the influence of multiple drugs, some of these being; LSD, Mescaline, and Ether. While you may expect Thompson's writings to be incoherent babble, they are actually very insightful and intellegent. In one part pf the story he compares the habitants of a casino to used car salesmen from Dallas, these are the kinds of insights he makes throughout the book. I recommend this book to anyone who likes good writing."
"1325",1324,"Peytongarrett","My all time favorite book. Nothing compares."
"1326",1325,"Scott Middleton","Skeptical though I may be of senseless debauchery, I thought this was one of the most fabulous pieces of journalism I'd ever read. With a voice and approach to travel lit that makes Bill Bryson look like Mr. Rogers, Hunter S. Thompson transformed a story about nothing (i.e. the motorcycle race that provides a flimsy pretense for his trip to Vegas) into a soaring indictment of hippies, pigs, squares, academics, and law-abiding citizens everywhere. I loved his colorful language and use of keywords; ""savage"" being one of my favorite words (""Savage Garden"" notwithstanding). Despite the ever-present threat of devolving into senselessness, the book's thrust remains intact and the writing is intentional while also feeling out of control. Thompson abuses fact, I'm sure, but really I don't care. What a great book for reading in a hotel, even if your aversion to debauchery prevents you from chewing mesculine blotters and ordering a quart of anejo on ice. "
"1327",1326,"Jo","A Hunter S. Thompson classic brilliant"
"1328",1327,"Eli Blevins","This book follows the lives of Raoul Duke and his attorney, Dr. Gonzo. Duke travels to Las Vegas to cover the Mint 400 off road race as a journalist. He takes this opportunity to rent a car and drive off into the desert with a trunk full of illegal drugs. The only part I disliked about the book is the way Dr. Gonzo treated the situations the duo gets into. Duke even pokes fun at his own profession, saying that journalism is a job taken just so one can goof off and do whatever they wish. This is a prime example of Gonzo journalism, with Duke questioning reality and all the paranoia the drugs cause. I like the way Duke vividly describes the people around him when he goes on a bad trip, capturing the mind of a drug user. Thompson creates a great story with which some true personal events and some fictional events occur. This book prompted me to watch the film which wasn't quite as interesting as the book, but I noticed that many other media references the movie. I would recommend this book to anyone"
"1330",1329,"Daniel Barratt","amazing hilarious book and amazing hilarious movie too."
"1331",1330,"Tristine","I LOVE THIS BOOK. Hunter Thompson is joyfully crazy. This is like nothing you'll ever read. "
"1333",1332,"Mandi Martin","This book is fast paced, insane, brilliant and awesome. The narrator doesn't ""Show"" the reader, he grabs your hand and drags you off at a full run. The disjointed narration made the twisted drug reality seem very realistic. I loved the moments when an unfortunate bystander was dragged into their madness and instead of acknowledging their own twisted outward projection, they accuse the onlooker of being on drugs or paranoid.There was a beautiful smoothness to the outrageousness; the narrator glossed over giant talking lizards as if describing the wall paint or some other mundane detail.

"1339",1338,"General H.

More than a sense of chemical-induced haze, you get a real feel for the shift in society. The change in poisons of choice, the change in attitude from what it had been before, the change in lifestyle. Fantastic. I love history, and this is such a perfect way to capture the real essence of what was changing and what was going on, instead of just theorizing and reading what the history books say, or historians babble about. (It is my personal belief that it's to recent to be truly objective about, as a historian.)We truly lost an inspiration when Hunter S. Thompson died in 2005. "
"1340",1339,"Christina Teasley","If you enjoy contemporary American History and reading about illicit drug use and/or journalist/author Hunter S. Thompson, you will enjoy this book.

"1342",1341,"Christian González","Hunter S. Thompson tiene ciertos problemas para escribir de manera que no parezca un sueño de mezcalina pero esa es la menor de las preocupaciones que me dan al leer este libro, la mayor es que es probable que no vuelva a leer otro libro suyo que tenga semejante peculiaridad sin pasar a ser una copia barata de la misma palabrería que inunda las paginas sin apego a nociones pre establecidas por nada, no se sentirá fresco pues.Leer este libro no me tomo ni siquiera dos sesiones o tres, básicamente empiezas y sabes que tendrás que mantenerte en el carrusel hasta que se acabe el tiempo, la narrativa es inexistente, solo hay balbuceos inconexos de lo que en verdad pareciera un maniático garabateando grandes citas en un montón de hojas que por azar serán puestas en orden solo para poder darle asignación numérica en algún momento. En verdad puedo decir que es bastante disfrutable y que la película donde Deep y del Toro saldrían diez años después le hace una increíble justicia a los personajes y las situaciones, valdría la pena ver esa cinta de nuevo después de que he leído el libro, pero no tengo tiempo con tanta películas nuevas que esperan a decepcionarme en la lista de cintas por ver."

It's so easy to read, fantastically entertaining and absolutely hilarious. This book made me feel a) inspired, b) like reading more of Thompson's work as soon as possible, and c) like taking loads of drugs."
"1366",1365,"John W. Dilley Jr.","Interesting read for sure!I rated this so highly because reading this book was such an interesting experience. I bought the e-book and the audio book for my kindle fire. I listened to the narrator on my headphones and read along with the highlighted portions on the screen in immersion mode. It made my hour long breaks at work go by much quicker. This book by Thompson is an interesting insight into Las Vegas and and American culture of 1971 through his disillusioned and drugged up eyes. I will caution however that it might not be everyone's cup of tea. Lots of profanity, drug use, bizarre encounters, and a meandering stream of consciousness narrative. I thoroughly enjoyed it though."

"1371",1370,"Jai Willkomm","Fear and loathing in Las Vegas is a story, based on true events, following the father of gonzo journalism Hunter s. Thompson and his attorney into the depts of Las Vegas. However, their journey is a bit odd compared to the average citizens trip to din city. The two were sent to Vegas to cover the story of a big up and coming motorcycle race called the mint 400. But on their way to Vegas and there, they unload their trunk full of every type of drug imaginable and take them all, rarely coming down. Hunter and his attorney experience good times, but mostly bad under the hold of all these drugs. They make ba decisions and somehow always find their way out. Fear and loathing for me was my type of book. I love it when authors experiment with stream of conciousness and let you feel like you are the character or at least there. Another thig I really liked was that Hunter S. Thompson is not afraid to get dirty and give every little detail no matter what the topic is. One thing that i did not like about this poece of work was that the transitions are not that smooth; he jumps around a bit and you have to put 2 and 2 together.This is my first time reading one of his novels and I would definitely read another. I rate this book 5 out of 5.If you are easily offended and cannot handle the true horrors of our world then please do not read this. Thompsons writing is very crude and gritty."

"1373",1372,"Alek Burt","If you are looking for a drug filled book that seems to go one hundred miles per hour the entire time, this is the book for you. The entire time you feel like you're inside the head of a crazy drug twisted journalist who's thoughts are constantly branching off of one another in a very interesting spiral that creates this book. There seems to be two plots. Part one, where the journalist and his attorney wander Las Vegas on Acid, Ether, Amyls, Cocaine, and just about any other drug you can think of, to cover a story on the Mint 400, a huge bike race held on the desert outskirts of Vegas. Then part two, where the journalist and his attorney, still in a twisted drug filled stupor, change objectives and cover a story on the Drug Convention going on at a hotel near the Flamingo in Vegas, where they are staying. Ironically they show up to the Drug Convention that is crawling with cops from all over the world twisted on all sorts of drugs including ones that the convention is talking about. This book could almost be described as a constant climax, you never know what is going to happen next with the way these two drug abusers act and think. Very good book."

"1378",1377,"Gabriel Sommer","A story about a reporter, a story about a lawyer, and a story about drugs. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a comedic yet terrifying story because of the many things that occur. Full of amazing doodle like sketches by the Author: Hunter S. Thompson. Now the main character, Gonzo, shows us how life is as a reporter. Why would a reporter go to Las Vegas with a trunk full of drugs? Well... why not? The book starts off with a quote ""He Who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man. This was said by Samuel Johnson. When i read this quote I thought about the meaning. To me this quote means that there are things in life that make us feel good, but are not good for us physically, spiritually, and socially. Now this is what this story is mostly based on. Drugs, and the affects of them."

"1394",1393,"Vishal Misra","Utterly brilliant. ""Fear and Loathing..."" totally deserves its cult status. This chronicle of Thompson's alter ego and his attorney's trip to Vegas is astonishing. It'll have you barking with laughter or giggling with glee. But it also contains great pearls of wisdom. Yes, this book chronicles heavy, downright extreme drug use. But, if you see past this, you see the wonderful satire of the American Dream and its pursuit. The pursuit of happiness is such a fragile concept and so fleeting, yet this book handles it all. Nothing is sacred. Consumerism, spirituality, religion and politics are all profaned in this book. The place where everyone can be a freak. The place where nothing is real. This book is a great ride, and a great critique of ""drug culture"" and the rise of the generation that no longer trusts anyone in the fallout of 1960s drug culture."

"1397",1396,"Henrik","I've never done hard drugs in my life but this book lets me feel like one of the cool kids like Hunter Thompson who does/did, but after reading this book I can pretend like I know shit about the lifestyle and feel cool.Other than that it's a very interesting read, I loved his writing style, the black humour, the weird, random and surreal factor to the whole story. Highly entertaining as well as thought-provoking. It can definitely be enjoyed by anyone regardless of drug-experience, but if I ever get arrested with a ton of drugs in my car, I know which book to blame for influencing me. "
"1399",1398,"pk","One of my all-time favorites. Whenever I need a laugh this is the book that delivers. ""It was somewhere around Barstow..."" "
"1400",1399,"Astrid","This is a tricky book to review. His gonzo style of journalism is exceptional and unique. And who else will take you inside a drug binge in Las Vegas during the National District Attorneys Association's Conference on Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs? Hunter S.

"1404",1403,"Donna","I was completely unsure how to classify this book, so it ended up in both fiction and non-fiction. Non-fiction because it is supposedly an account of Thompson's trip to Vegas to write a story and Fiction because I find it hard to believe that he experienced so much incredible stuff in such a short period of time. Either way, this was a fascinating and enjoyable book. I was, in turns, laughing out loud and completely horrified. Quite an accomplishment for one short book."

"1439",1438,"Insert","Like most people, F&L is what introduced me to Hunter S. Thompson. I've since went on to read the majority of his published material and consider him one of my all-time favorites. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the 60's-70's era and the american social situation that existed. Also, people who just like to laugh at absurd and over the top drug benders "

"1452",1451,"Ryan Tiner","I always hate reading books like this, it reminds me of when I go to Paris and after enjoying myself and taking it all in I without fail have small, but robust thoughts cross my mine that tell me that I could easily disappear, skip the train back and rent a small apartment or couch surf under a fake name. Sure I would get caught eventually maybe, but it would take a pretty respectable amount of time and I don't believe Id be a top priority of any sort. Also there's the whole jail thing. On the other side I have a weird obsession with the concept of the American Dream, if it is indeed a concept and not an actual goal. This book puts a lot of thoughts into perspective on that, what were people looking for? What did they find? A part of the book that always sticks with me the most other then the classic Wave Speech is the remark that downers came in with Nixon. It doesn't seem like anything of a huge comment, but to me I think it really says a lot of not only the people of that era, but what happened to America as whole. Currently I'm trying to get my base to play this at the theatre on the big screen and I can get that done and spread it as far as I can then I feel I did something. Hunter S Thompson was in the military after all so the least I could do is honor it."

"1471",1470,"Efren Aguilar","This is a classic in gonzo authorship. Part fact, part fiction, part hallucination... but like reality, each is as important to the human experience as the next. Plot synopsis - taken from wikipedia:Journalist Raoul Duke and attorney Dr. Gonzo travel to Las Vegas in 1971 to cover a motorcycle race for Sports Illustrated and experience a haphazardly planned vacation. As Duke and Gonzo live out the final days of the counter-culture through the use of the drugs LSD, cocaine, mescaline, and cannabis, among others, they wreck cars, hallucinate with visions of desert animals and, eventually, begin to mistrust each other. The two eventually leave Las Vegas, separately. The book ends with Raoul in a pharmacy in Denver, imagining himself ""just sick enough to be totally confident""."

It's fun, it's silly, and it reads easy. There's social commentary here, much of it still relevant to the farce of a society we are currently in, but Thompson's meditations of the 1960s counterculture are in the backseat, hostage to the excesses of Duke and Gonzo screaming down the highway at speeds that shouldn't be thought about, much like the naïve hitchhiker in the early part of the book. This book is not to be taken seriously, it's just for fun. Don't expect any more than that."

"1494",1493,"Seth Kenlon","Excellent book. If you've seen the movie then you've actually very nearly read this book; the two are surprisingly similar. I don't really care so much about the events in the book; it's the language, the actual writing, that appeals to me. The story telling style is also interesting; I love the way it never seems to stay on topic and yet still manages to tell an engaging and emotional tale. Really well written; I literally read it through once, and then flipped back to the front and re-read it."
"1498",1497,"James Newland","A really interesting book, I found it fairly difficult to keep up with the storyline. It was quite erratic but it was a story about a constant drug trip so I wasn't expecting it to be easy reading. I finished it really quickly as I felt if I didn't read it consistently I would lose track (and I often did) of what was happening. I would recommend it to certain people but not everyone, it is a pretty mature book in my opinion"
"1499",1498,"Shovelmonkey1","Whoop whoop, yeehaw, arrrrghflurszlegastle, shit shit shit drugs make you crazy. Yes, yes they do. So the first question is exactly how many drugs did Hunter S Thompson actually imbibe when writing this book. Either one too many or not enough would be my answer. First off, I'd like to critique the author photo on the inside sleeve of this book. Hello.. there's Hunter S Thompson staring out from the page. He is wearing what can only be described as a three-tone patch-work denim shirt, and old-skool Aviators and draped in an American Flag. He's standing in front of a ""clever"" montage of boiled sharks jaws (a la Robert Shaws boat house in Jaws), another couple of miscellaneous animal skulls and a hunting knife which has been jabbed into the wooden shelf. Aside from the fact that I'm a vegetarian and not at all patriotic (towards America or even my own country), I have to say that three-tone denim is an extremely ill advised look Mr Thompson; one might even go so far as to say a mighty fashion faux pas, hence the loss of a star in the ratings. Moving on...I didn't hate this book (or loath it) but I didn't exactly love it either (but am at the same time weirdly impressed and drawn in... shucks i'm upping the rating to a fat five stars). Cult status for this sort of thing is frequently imposed by people who look at this sort of tale as a potential bible to live by. Listen up kids, taking this amount of drugs would fuck you up so good that you would probably shit your brain out of your own ear and not even notice. I've never taken so many drugs as to shit my brain out of my own ear but I did once have my own Fear and Loathing style road trip experience.A few years ago I was travelling from the Iranian Border to a town in a mountainous (read as not touristy) region of Turkey on the train. Three gentleman arrived at the station dressed as deeply religious local individuals (full on beards, prayer beads, traditional shalwar and skull caps), loaded their motor-bikes onto the rear of the train and proceeded to the yatakli car (sleeper car). After a while I encountered them again in the dining car and pretty quickly became sure that they were not local. After some hard eye-balling across the carriage we eventually struck up a conversation and it turns out that said gentlemen were en route back to their home town country of the Czech Republic having just been to Afghanistan. Their behaviour was a bit erratic and the random disguise was clearly falling apart after a large amount of beer and spirits were consumed. Every time we entered a tunnel they'd jump up on the tables and chairs, wave their arms over their heads and should wooloolooloooloooooo for as long as we were in the tunnel. Yes, you're thinking, this is not the behaviour of a sane/un-stoned person. Clearly. When the beer had run out and we still had another 12 hours of train-trapped boredom to endure, they asked if I would like to join them for the rest of the journey and participate in a party. On offer was a share of some of the more high-end products that they claimed to have brought (in bulk) from Afghanistan. Having seen Midnight Express, I declined and returned to my seat. About an hour later one of the individuals was so out of his mind that he decided to go into the main carriage and tried to climb into the overhead luggage rack for a sleep, after mistaking it for his own bed, then getting into a big argument with people who were unhappy about a man drooling and snoring on their suitcases. The gendarme were called (rather unluckily there was a whole platoon of them travelling at the rear of the train). The gentlemen were removed from the train, screamed at, severely kicked and pistol whipped, had a few AK47's pointed very levelly at their heads and advised in no uncertain terms that this was not an acceptable way to behave. The bottom line? Apparently you can only get away with this kind of behaviour in Vegas."
"1500",1499,"Faiza Sattar","I've never read anything this decadent and depraved, yet so important and brilliantly crafted...as I find myself almost enamored by the ugliness and perversity to which Hunter S Thompson sunk into. It's like trespassing his mind, his most personal evocative thoughts to the point that the reader himself loses his sense of reality, that thin, gray line between fact and fiction so sporadically blurred but producing an effect no fiction or journalistic endeavor alone could have achieved. He disembowels the myth of the great American dream with cruel, heartless precision, like a vicious slasher, hacking to death every dream one ever dreams. He doesn't sugar-coat, instead presents the ugly truth of a never existent societal foundation upon which all dreams are relayed into the land of ones fancies. With his drug addled brain, and speeches fueled with erratic bursts of conversations going in no particular direction, his prose lays naked before the reader, exposing not just his personal experience but the great facade of which everyone is aware of yet no one speaks of. After reading this ""novel"", I too am, in the Doctors kind words sprayed with ""shit-mist."""
"1502",1501,"Nailmouth","I read this having watched the Terry Gilliam movie countless times. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the movie stayed remarkably close to the source, the narration quoting entire passages from the book verbatim, lines shuffled to keep continuity, but retaining the essential spirit of the novel.Thompson's work captures something naked and hungry in the subconscious of 1970's United States, a raw, bleeding, unflinching eye staring into the vacuum of a post-60's abyss, rattling forward into Nixon's Madman Theory handling of the country and Vietnam. The writing is definitively grotesque, startlingly brilliant, and undeniably one of the funniest books I've ever read.With a razor-sharp wit, Thompson surgically dissects the excesses of Las Vegas in the early 70s, a metaphor for consumer-culture and the failed 'American Dream'. I would highly recommend this book to any fan of the movie, and of intelligent, narrative [non] fiction. This book creates a vivid portrait of the events that took place during the trip he and Oscar Zeta Acosta (the infamous Dr. Gonzo) took to Vegas to discuss the murder of television journalist Rubén Salazar at the hands of LAPD.To paraphrase Thompson,Two of God's own prototypes... high-powered mutants of some kind never even considered for mass production. Too weird to live, and too rare to die.The two proceed to break every rule in the book, and go on a drug-fueled rampage that leaves carnage and confusion behind. One of the funniest and most captivating books I've ever read."

"1513",1512,"Taylor","This book was pretty awesome. Advice. Read this book in one or two settings. I read it over a period of two weeks, and sometimes I had trouble following the plot because I had forgotten what happened previously."
"1514",1513,"Jacob Ethington","I have read this book several times in the last few months. Why? Because it's just fascinating. An insane look at drugs, but a very interesting reflection of the counterculture. This is one of the few novels where I highly recommend watching the film. The film is highly accurate to the novel, and considering the madness that goes on in Fear and Loathing, that's quite a scary thought."
"1515",1514,"Ron","Thompson's surreal masterpiece set standards that few authors have ever even attempted to live up to. This is a manic, crazed tale of drug abuse and professional destruction by men desperate to make a living while living it up. Few could handle the drugs and alcohol; none could turn it into art."
"1518",1517,"MIchael","""We were somewhere around Barstow, near the edge of the desert, when the drugs began to take hold."" Best opening line ever! From the moment I read that, I was hooked. Is it true or was it a drug frenzied dream? It doesnt matter because this book is about two men in vegas, carrying mroe drugs than the nation of Bolivia. an absolute must read!"
"1519",1518,"Stepheny(Annie Wilkes)","“We were somewhere around Barstow, on the edge of the desert, when the drugs began to take hold.”I remember the first time I read  Alice in Wonderland I said to myself- Stepheny, what the hell did you just read? I was lost, confused and quite certain that the book was a random conglomeration of events that surely only someone heavily under the influence of multiple drugs could possibly understand. Well, I have come to the conclusion that Hunter S. Thompson’s  Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is the adult version of  Alice in Wonderland. This is a book about two guys travelling through the desert in search of the American Dream. These two are so fucked up on drugs that you as the reader don’t have clue what is actually happening. In fact, if there were ever fanfiction I would want to read, it would be anything written from the perspective of the other characters in this book. You know, telling us what was actually happening. Here you have two men completely whacked out on multiple drugs…wouldn’t you just love to see what the scenarios were like from someone else’s perspective?? I can’t be the only one who thinks these accounts would be worth reading!“We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers... and also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of Budweiser, a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls. Not that we needed all that for the trip, but once you get locked into a serious drug collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can.”Anyway, these scenes are absolutely insane. Everything in this story feels so over the top, yet so likely under the circumstances. When reading this book you’ll feel like you’re the one tripping your face off on all these drugs and questioning the reality of the world you live in. The writing in this book is what surprised me the most. I had a basic idea of what the book was about and a very vague idea of who Hunter S. Thompson was before picking this book up. It amazed me how profound some of the thoughts were for a book about being whacked out of your mind. I really loved the writing and can’t wait to read more of his work. Sure it was vulgar, but when you set all that aside and look at what is being said, I think then you will begin to realize what an incredible mind he had.“Journalism is not a profession or a trade. It is a cheap catch-all for fuckoffs and misfits -- a false doorway to the backside of life, a filthy piss-ridden little hole nailed off by the building inspector, but just deep enough for a wino to curl up from the sidewalk and masturbate like a chimp in a zoo-cage.”I think this last quote I will share with you is probably the best summary of  Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas I could hope to give you. So, here it is:“1) Never trust a cop in a raincoat.2) Beware of enthusiasm and of love, both are temporary and quick to sway.3) If asked if you care about the world's problems, look deep into the eyes of he who asks, he will never ask you again.4) Never give your real name.5) If ever asked to look at yourself, don't look.6) Never do anything the person standing in front of you can't understand.7) Never create anything, it will be misinterpreted, it will chain you and follow you for the rest of your life.”"
"1521",1520,"Timothy Kerrigan","Way better than the movie - and I loved the movie!"
"1522",1521,"Andrew Uys","Wow. I saw the movie years ago when it was in theatres (and in a manner that would have made Hunter S Thompson proud), but hadn't read the book (or EVER re-watched the film) until now. Powerful, disorientating, and the closest thing to an acid trip without actually taking acid. Reading Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas had the ability to transport me out of the mundane, and into the car seat right beside Thompson, such is the gift of his writing. A highly recommended read for anyone who wants to step out of the ordinary, and take a trip of the wild side of America."

"1539",1538,"Tkammer","One of the best books I've read re: the pursuit of happiness -- the American Dream as it were. . . the image of the high and beautiful wave in the 60s, the watermark, the place where you can see it crested and rolled back, breaks my heart every time. People often mistake this book for a drug anecdote -- indeed, there are a depraved amount of drugs in play, but there is significantly more in play."
"1540",1539,"Evert","The first time I was introduced to this story was with Johnny Depp as Mr. Duke in the film adaption. I could not care less about the film. The 'dated' camera work and over-acting were not quite my cup of tea. The second time I watched the film I was a little older and started to appreciate art more. Especially, the strange pieces like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. I loved it and could not see why I hated it at first. After watching it with a friend he gave the book to me for my birthday. And as much as I liked the film, which damn near follows the book line for line, this story works so, so, SO much better in written word. Even with the Depp, Del Toro, characters in mind I found that the book took me to different, better places and a lot of lines made me laugh out loud. Especially this one, which I will remember for a long long time:""There's a giant snake made of light coming right for us!""""Shoot it.""""No, I want to study its habits."" I'm giving it 5 stars and am going to recommend it to anyone who wants to listen!"

"1555",1554,"Craig Doig","This is one of my favorite books of all time. The way Hunter S. Thomson writes is explosively funny and the situations that he gets himself into have to be read to be believed.

"1570",1569,"Arden Haele","i find his means of arriving at a piece like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, a bit base, but there's no way to deny it's a masterpiece. and although it's among my favorite books to read, a work of genius, it is not. i see him as a sort of pollock of writing, with a legacy based on style and the fantastically stubborn pursuit of a dream. hilarious, appalling and clever, and it reaches admirably deep into a theory on human depravity and the loss of hope. told as if happening all around at the moment, it's really great fun to read."
"1572",1571,"Mat","Awesome."
"1573",1572,"Max","This book is, in some ways, terrifying. Insanity, claustrophobia, drugs, and reckless endangerment - all relentlessly driven by a twisted sense of purpose - permeate the narrative. Gonzo journalism at its finest."

I have written about 25,000 words, but it was shelved at some point in 2007 and I haven't worked on it since. Hopefully, I will get back to it one day."

"1585",1584,"AK","Though the elder Thompson became trapped by the monster he'd created (mostly in this book) and, often, in the end became a caricature of himeself, HST remains a genius. With Fear and Loathing most people miss the point. His assessment of the scene at the time is brilliant and unfortunately still relevant. Most (present piece included) descriptions of the book are pointless."

"1588",1587,"Brent McCulley","Thompson's opus; for a good reason, his literary style - gonzo journalism - makes for one wild narrative of illicit, bombastic, insidious, drug-crazed insanity. Americana at it's finest."
"1590",1589,"Emmett","Ah, 'twas the first book i ever read. And i loved it so much that - instead of inspiring a lifetime of avid reading - I thought it was the only book in the world i would ever need to read, and just reread it about eight times before even picking up another book...I haven't read it for over two years, and am sure if i did read it again, it wouldn't have the same impact on me that it had the first time. So i think i'll leave it alone, for now anyway."
"1591",1590,"Angie Adamson","Hunter S. Thompson ruminates about society and the surroundings in the increasingly doomed, drug-infested Las Vegas. Raul Duke and his trusted attorney Dr. Gonzo are chasing the American dream in this autobiographical novel. the journey the two men take is one in which the reader cannot look back, but only hold on for life and soak up each of Thompson's words as he delves deeper into hysteria. The psychedelic escapes which illustrate this novel make it a true masterpiece and classic."

"1593",1592,"Ad","I love his samoan attorney and his saying "" As your attorney I advise.."" This book is where hunter found his style totally original like a beat writer gone journalist. I would laugh out loud often. However much drugs and alcohol was undertaken he would report some very insightful and accurate dissertations on his times and culture. After reading his other books Hell Angels and The Rum Diary I can see how he was leading up to this incredibly original way of journalism. One does not need to get out of their mind to be emphatic to what he's feeling and seeing just read his novel and you can experience it like taking a drug. I enjoyed how they talked there way out of situations like when his attorney Oscar Zeta brought to there suite a young woman who was set on giving Barbara Streisand her drawings or the maid finding costa in the closet puking on his shoes naked.A lot of the situations one could never get away with today like going on a plane with a satchel full of drugs and a big hand gun. So this time capsule novel will stand for sure as a classic and historical novel on the drug culture. "

Sure the premise remains a glorified bender in Vegas. and some may criticize that praising this work lends credence to the drug culture. True, biting, satiric, I bow down to the writing....descriptions, the flow of the story. Mesmerizing. Marks HF Thompson as the true voice of the culture in latter 20th century.

"1611",1610,"Marvin","I read this book in 1972. There was nothing like it before and probably never will be again. Thompson was at the height of his short reign of creativity and wrote like he was on a roller coaster to hell. As he stated in this book, he was searching for the American Dream, like many of us were, but he saw the nightmare as well as the dream. Many of my generation were seduced by Kerouac's On The Road, however Thompson turned that on its head and forced us to look at the dark edges. I still read this book over and over. Hunter S. Thompson is the greatest writer of his generation."

I thought he had bought a misprint because there was an inkblot in the middle of the page over top of some words. When I realized that this was the way that the book comes I immediately came in my pants and had to read it. This novel is of course a classic. Every strange minute of drug induced debotchery was worth my time. Dr.Thompson was a rare breed who forged a road that no one even knew was there. May he rest in pieces."

Here's the deal: fiction, non-fiction, or somewhere in between, the story of two dope freaks who spend a week in Las Vegas getting trashed, skipping hotel bills, infiltrating a District Attorneys' conference on drugs, and all the other madness in that slim little jewel made me question whether or not I could handle such a gig. I had to be honest with myself and answer no. And if I didn't have the stones to be such a balls-out mutant rebel, since I have no respect for dilettante rebels, I might as well just get out of the game all together.

There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible than a man in the depths of an ether binge….” This is the iconic quote from Hunter S.Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. This infamous novel was one of the first non-objective stories to be published. This story was origin of Gonzo Journalism.My brother lent me this book after I mentioned that i thought it looked interesting. When I first saw the cover it intrigued me into glancing at the first few pages. Before I knew it I finished the first chapter. Did I mention this is all real? Yes, Hunter S. Thompson went on a drug fueled adventure through Las Vegas in order (in his words) to find the American Dream.Honestly this book was a brutal read; I mean how one can do this without police catching on to their shenanigans. The two main characters are Raoul Duke (an Alias for Hunter) and Duke’s Attorney whose name we never truly know. These two men are both heavy drinkers and drug users which leads them to do erratic and outrageous actions. A example of their irresponsible behavior was pulling a gun on a diner worker to take some lemon pie; or when Raouls attorney asks him to shove a electric radio into his own bathtub filled with chinese bath salts that turned the water green to “stimulate him” while holding a knife. Many times there are recurring subjects of violence, police, the American Dream, psychedelic drugs, and hypocrisy. My mind was more focused on how much trouble they are causing and how outrageous their behavior is. I was very surprised they haven’t gotten themselves killed halfway through the novel.My feelings after finishing the novel were of disbelief, amazement, and interest. The men have very vivid actions and emotions portrayed through the story. I honestly could not figure out what I enjoyed most about the novel. Its style, characters, imagery and feeling are incredible. Overall this is a amazing read, and if you're interested in reading crazy stories with no real objective and don't have a faint heart this is the book for you. I'm seriously considering reading other works of his."

"1637",1636,"Abram Martinez","I really love this book for its humor. It has been a while since I have laughed out loud while reading. The character of Dr. Gonzo aka ""Attorney"" is one of the funniest literary characters of all time. After doing some research I found out that the character is based on a man named Oscar Zeta Acosta-- a Los Angeles attorney who apparently has been missing and presumed dead since the 70s. If I had to put my finger on my reasons for finding the book much more funnier than when I first read it as a teenager would admittedly be the fact that I have experimented in some of the substances the characters used in the book. Nothing to brag about but it made the book a lot more accurate because I was able to draw authenticity in the text from my own stupid life choices. It's easier to laugh at people doing the same stupid shit you once did and know that you are not alone in the world. I'm going to change my rating from 4 to 5 because this is a seminal American classic. If this book can be classified under the transgressive umbrella then I guess that is what we are calling it, but it is more just a very readable and interesting story. None of that niche 'naked lunch' type feel that only a complete weirdo can relate to. This book is for everyone....who is somewhat reckless."

I'll leave it to other reviewers to detail the plot, but will say that Gilliam did a great job with the film, and the reason the film was great was because the book is so well written, flying from problem to problem in an ever descending spiral of chaos. "
"1647",1646,"Peter Wakeman","Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is one of the best books that I have ever had the pleasure of reading. In it, Thompson, referred to as Raoul Duke in the book, and his attorney, Oscar Zeta Ocasta, referred to as Dr. Gonzo, go on a drug induced adventure in the city of Las Vegas on the search for the American Dream. In the mean time, Duke is supposed to cover the Mint 400, a classic motorcycle race through the Nevada dessert, but seeing how many drugs are being consumed, the race takes a back seat in the story. The drugs consumed consist mainly of liquor, amyls, acid, marijuana, and the dreaded bottle of raw ether, in which there is not a single scene in the story where they are not under the influence of at least one of these substances. They mess up their apartment, their rented car, and abuse the employees of the hotel. After the coverage of the Mint 400, Duke is requested to cover the National District Attorneys Association's Conference on Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs that was being held in Las Vegas as well. What to do?.... Why not pull the same burn on another hotel on the other side of town? So alas, that's what the two deviants do. The story puts many of the things I want to do before I die down on paper, and really showed me how intense a huge drug binge can truly be."

"1650",1649,"Chamberlon","The wildest most exiting trip into a mind of debauchery and paranoia. The late Hunter S. Thompson was known for riding both sides of the extremes with his journalism for Rolling Stone magazine, and his columns for various other publications such as the San Francisco Examiner. He could be brilliant one day, and way off of the rails the next (sometimes at the same time). This book is no different. Here Thompson tells a tale of a mad journalist on a road trip to Vegas in search of the ""American Dream.""It is not my practice to give away important plot points to potential readers and I won't start now. First of all, there is no plot here. There is only the crazy, drug induced adventures of two characters who seem to share the one goal in life of seeing which one of them could spend the most time into an altered reality. If you are not easily offended by off-color humor; and you might be looking for a humorous tale that does not make much sense in terms of narrative structure after the first ten pages, (but you could let all of that slide because you are laughing so hard at the absurdity of it all) then ""Fear and loathing in Las Vegas"" is were you want to put your eyes. How could you not be drawn in by someone who travels in a beat up car from state to state with only the luggage of a trunk full of ""uppers, downers, screamers, laughers, raw ether, and two dozen amyls."" and constantly ducking ""those G#%damn bats."""

"1681",1680,"Justin Cheng"," This novel is best known for its unique writing/reporting style that Thompson calls, in the novel itself, gonzo journalism. its famous for blending fact and fiction by putting the author as the center of the story, the protagonist. Although technically sent out to cover a motorcycle race, he takes it upon himself and his trusty accomplice/attorney, Dr. Gonzo, to find the American Dream. In order to achieve this, they decide it's necessary to stock up on as many drugs they can find and rent a convertible. This leads to a hallucinatory trip around Las Vegas that's, quite simply, out of this world. 	Personally, I loved the novel. Thompsons hallucinations were entertaining to read about and his writing style is fast paced and engaging. However, he also offers keen insights into the rise and fall of the 1960's and the mindset of the current (1970's) generation. His search for the American Dream is a perfect contrast to his misanthropy and the downtrodden pessimistic generation Thompson describes. His frustration and manic, self destructive energy, nicely complimented by a good dose of dark humor, sets a very dark, twisted atmosphere that perfectly underscores their zany antics. 	Objectively, there are many faults with the novel. Thompson himself has discredited the book as a failed experiment. It often strays from the facts such as the questionable use of a drug called Andrenochrome which has yet to be proven to have any actual psychedelic effects. There is also very little real plot development as much (nearly all) of the book is centered on Thompson and his attorney ruminating on the 60's and rampaging through Las Vegas on a large variety of drugs without any real purpose. Both his quest for the American Dream and his actual assignment from the magazine are used as excuses to do more drugs, harass tourists and drive through the desert at insane speeds. Basically, I enjoyed it immensely and based purely on my opinion, give it five stars. However, it is not for everyone. "
"1683",1682,"Sean Wentz","If this Thompson guy can write this book on just about every drug under the sun just imagin what he could do sober. But Thompson was never really sober so what we have to work with is lines riddled with ones constant use of coke and severe alcoholism. Yet I feel this book captures well the radical ideals of the time. It is a description of the times and it depicts them from the eyes of the rebel, of the otherside, the one less glorified. From Thompson's running out on high hotel bills to quarraling with the local vegas folk the story is definitely entertaining. Thompson although under the influence still emerges as one of the times most influential writers."

"1695",1694,"Ken Ke","Hunter S. Thompson first published Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, in the summer of 1971, and still the impacts of the book can be felt today. Gonzo journalism at its finest, Fear and Loathing encompasses the journey of a drug-mad journalist, Raoul Duke in his mission to find the American dream in turbulent times of the late 60’s. Accompanied by only his mescaline and acid induced hallucinations, along with his attorney Dr. Gonzo, Duke journeys across the land of the free in an attempt to find the “main nerve” of the American culture.One of the most interesting things in the book; and what I have been looking for in literature, is its bare, uncut, and raw narrative style, written as a first person account. It shows us how a world at a different time was to the common folk. America in it’s prime, the sweeping counter-culture revolution of the late 1960’s and the tremendous impact of LSD, when it was first introduced to the social psyche of the still innocent American youth. The book was good because of the fact that it was published in 1971, the after years of the summer of love, the author was more or less reminiscing the times, and the passing of an era. This can be perfectly surmised on pg. 66- 68, the “wave speech” often regarded as Thompson’s most favoured passage in Fear and Loathing. Here is an excerpt“You could strike sparks anywhere, there was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning...And that, I think was the handle- that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of old and evil. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn’t need that. Our energy would simply prevail. There was no point in fighting-on our side or theirs. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave....So now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look west, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark-that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.”A thing to be noted is the brilliant imagery the author creates, often times the narrator, so to speak, is in the midst of a twisted acid trip. To give words and meanings to things that only our dreams of dreams can conjure, is a task indeed, a task that Thompson does admirably.“No!” I shouted. Why? We haven’t done anything yet!”” My legs felt rubbery. I gripped the desk and sagged toward her as she held out the envelope, but i refused to accept it. The woman’s face was changing: swelling, pulsing... horrible green jowls and fangs jutting out, the face of a moray eel! Deadly poison! “The use of Italics in key words also added to the atmosphere of the story. Due to the fact that the novel is written in a first person narrative style, the use of italics was needed to give emotion and emphasis to a certain word; it changes the tone of the entire sentence, or paragraph in question and although you cannot see what the characters are seeing, you can certainly feel the way they speak. Fear and Loathing, a memoir from a different time and perhaps a different consciousness, a paradigm of gonzo journalism, Thompson has created a piece worth calling “an American classic”. Throughout the novel you never can really distinguish what is real and what is an illusion, what is a dream? What is concrete? What is reality? The truth it seems is stranger than fiction."

This must be remedied.As much as I enjoy and vocalize my adoration for On the Road, this was the novel that inspired a million prospective road trips for me, mainly just jets across the desert with possible horrible implications, but still.Being both a work of fiction and nonfiction simultaneously, it has that hard to categorize thing about it, something that's remedied by Hunter himself, and just goes under the label of Gonzo Journalism. And here's my inspiration for becoming a journalist. Of course, I could never become anything quite like this, but if I could walk into an office with a portable typewriter, cigarette, and the bottom third of a bottle of booze, then I would be getting close to that.Enough about that, though, back to the book.This book, essentially, represents the Gonzo Aesthetic, to inject yourself in the middle of a story, to report not on what is happening directly, but on how you as the writer see things, on how things are unfolding about you. The covering of the Mint 400 and the National District Attorneys Association's Conference on Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs become after images of the rest of the book, the focus remains on Duke and Dr. Gonzo while they run and scream their way down The Strip and through Thrompson's mobile police narcotics lab. These people are what I consider to be my heroes, partly for the freedoms they've been able to ascertain through whatever means they've gone through, but mostly because they've been able to write about it so well."

"1754",1753,"Robert Rifkin","Many people begin their acquaintance with Hunter S. Thompson by reading this book. It is one of those epochal sensations, as Tom Woolf called it that becomes more effective with every passing decade. It is one of the craziest trips around, a buddy-road trip to the “savage heart of the American Dream.” Thompson’s drug-fueled “trip” to a Las Vegas convention of police chiefs is less a journalistic tour-de-force than a ground-breaking, rule-discarding primer on “the new journalism,” a movement that many believe began with this book. Many successful journalists aspired to write the way Thompson did, but none of them succeeded. Thompson was literally, the only effective practitioner of the Gonzo style he invented."
"1756",1755,"Kylie","This book is hilarious. The paranoia of Thompson and his Samoan attorney as they hoon around Las Vegas and try to act 'normal' when they find themselves in the middle of a narcotics conference surrounded by police is very, very funny.

"1758",1757,"Berit Swanberg","A classic! "
"1759",1758,"Lew Wagerly","One of the most entertaining and thought provoking books i have ever read. I dont want to say it changed my life but it kind of did....too weird to live too rare to die."

"1767",1766,"T.W. Fairchild","Text to Self:Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas is a great book that tells the twisted story of the ""American Dream"" and the drug induced ways of the two men trying to find this dream.. The book connects to me in a small way. I have seen how drugs can change people and ruin their lives, maybe not to the extreme this book shows, but I have seen it. This book shows how the drugs can catch up to someone and how it hurts them. This book puts fear of the uncontrolled drug craving way that people can get when they are lost and addicted.Text to Text:When reading this book, I have noticed that the book reminds me of other movies and even music that I have heard or seen about drugs. Movies such as American Gangster and Blow seem to show some of the same situations that Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas does. Also there is a lot of music these days that talk about craziness and drug use. This is what Fear and Loathing is all about. Text to World:Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas really does show the underground twisted world of drugs and Las Vegas. Hunter S. Thompson really gives great detail to how drugs can take over someones life and how it is everywhere. The book shows you examples of how twisted people can be and how violent and crazy drugs can lead someone. The world seems to have a drug problem, and always have since the drugs have been invited. This book puts the problem into light and tales a story of a drug based trip to Las Vegas. "
"1769",1768,"Armon",""" As your attorney, I advise you"" to immediately grab some ether and experience the acid trip to find the American Dream with Hunter S Thompson's alter ego Raoul Duke. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a dive into the crazed world of drug abuse. Insane act and insane speak twist your brain as you read to the point that the only way to untie the knot is to laugh your ass off. At times, the writings make each drug sound as if it's a fun ride which you can purchase a ticket for at Disneyworld, then the tone swifts to show the awful and terrifying effects of each drug as if it's a cleverly disguised devil who promises your dreams but delivers your nightmares. The plot of the book takes a back seat to the two main characters in the story, Raoul Duke, an middle-ages freelance journalist who is more interested in his pursuit of the ""American Dream"" to live in luxury than the type reports about his paid assignments, and Dr. Gonzo, an obese Samoan Lawyer with an ill-temper while under the influence of any drug and acts as both a side-kick and influence to Duke's binges. Their insanity is enhanced by the main setting of the novel, Las Vegas and the surrounding desert. After the ether, mescal, coke, and hash, you will discover just how far a man's mind can be drugged,driven and crashed and still function with clarity as any other human ""swine""."

While the film was amazing in it's own respect (and to it's credit, stays pretty damn close to the content of the book), after reading this work of genius I can honestly say this is by far one of the funniest and most random stories ever!I laughed out loud the whole book through; true story.Highly readable & hard to put down."

"1870",1869,"Kevin Zavala","Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a well-illustrated tale of Hunter S. Thompson's drug crazed escapades during a long weekend in Las Vegas. The story is mayhem, the line between reality and alternate consciousness progressively gets erased as heavier and heavier hallucinogens get taken. Thompson and his attorney spend the entire book in a grip of paranoia and disillusionment. They destroy their hotel room, they total their rental car, they completely lose control of the situation to a point where it’s hard to believe, but in the end, their goal to find the “american dream” is accomplished; Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a mindbending view at american culture in Las Vegas. I highly recommend this book because of the wildly fascinating storyline and secondly, because Hunter S. Thompsons journalism style is worth a glance."
"1873",1872,"James S.","I read this about 8 years ago and I remembered I really enjoyed it. The style is easy to read and it's very exciting."
"1875",1874,"Magic Mike","If you've seen the movie you have pretty much read the book, but it is still worth reading. Every word spoken in the movie is straight from the book however not every word in the book made it to the movie. Some lines in the movie that seem totally random actually have more context to them in the book. There is also the great artwork by Ralph Steadman to enjoy! Really one of the most original stories ever written and it's mostly true! Perfect."

"1882",1881,"Jiri","Very entertaining and very quick read, even though it took me almost two months to finish it. I have been to Las Vegas twice and thus I could very vividly imagine the spirit of the city and the heats of surrounding deserts. Otherwise I would've probably rated little lower (worse 4*), but definitely can recommend to read."
"1883",1882,"Christopher Staley","Everything they say about this book is true. Generally the book turns out to be a far cry from the hype. This is the exception to that rule. "
"1884",1883,"Rylee Carpenter","loved it"
"1886",1885,"Jacobmartin","Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a hell of a drug, maybe Rick James would say something like that about this book. It's a surreal and utterly unwholesome journey into Las Vegas, where Raoul Duke must cover a rally racing car event, but is sidetracked by many setbacks including the lack of his own sobriety."
"1888",1887,"Gregory Knapp","HST is the best American non-fiction writer since Mark Twain, and is his equal.Like Twain, HST wrote about many things.

"1890",1889,"Benny ","The death of the American dream as it could have only been reported by journalist, Dr. Hunter S. Thompson."
"1891",1890,"Silentist","This is truly a fun book and the illustrations are gorgeous. When I first picked it up in middle school, I could not believe my eyes after seeing ""based on truth"" somewhere on the back. There was laughter and worry in my heart at the same time, I had no idea how to digest such an existence! Then I began to study on Hunter S. Thompson and Gonzo, all the while my appreciation for his art grew immense. Gargantuan. Colossal. The film adaptation did not disappoint me either. I would be struck down if anyone could demolish what he had written. "
"1892",1891,"Zoe"," what a fantastic book!!!"
"1896",1895,"Manderr","The reason I enjoy this book is because Thompson does such a good job at painting the picture of a drug-binged trip. At times you feel like you're actually experiencing all that they're experiencing, from the tripping to the things they see and do. You can escape into the book."
"1899",1898,"Victoria Cole","I was reading this book in a hospital waiting area and was laughing out loud. Very funny in a sarcastic way."

"1905",1904,"Nom de Plume","Duh!!!!!"
"1906",1905,"Andrew Henderson","This is the perfect introduction to Hunter S's genius. I was actually shocked by how quickly I got through it (about a day and a half) but that's probably mostly thanks to the film being almost exactly the same. The illustrations by Ralph Steadman are beautiful in a grotesque way. I envy anyone who read the book before seeing the film, I'd have loved to imagine some of those drug trips without being influenced by the visuals of the adaptation."

"1908",1907,"Greig Grey","Absolutely, hands down the best... Except for maybe ""The Curse of Lono.""Rest in peace Good Doctor."
"1909",1908,"Nathan Huff","Much like The Great Gatsby the american dream is at the center of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and apparently the only way to get to the dead center of it is to consume an insane amount of drugs. The loose plot of the story revolves around Hunter S. Thompson (Raoul Duke) and his attorney Dr. Gonzo driving to Las Vegas to cover a story with a ridiculous amount of ""heinous chemicals"" in the trunk of their convertible. Right when the book starts it pulls you in for a hilarious ride while providing a commentary on the 60's and early 70's. Thompson brilliantly captures the disillusionment, desperation, and affluence that is characterized with the generation and he doesn't mind making some jabs at himself. The book is written in a very simple style and doesn't break away that much like Naked Lunch did which makes it an easier read. Thompson is known for going all out with stories and he sure did in this one. Not much left to say except that it is one of the most entertaining books I have read in a long time. "
"1911",1910,"S","Classic, haha."
"1912",1911,"Branson Crum","Before I review the book I would like to say that prior to reading the book I had no interest in the movie.That being said I have been recommended this book dozens of times by people. Namely my brother's AA friends. I told them the same thing every time: I'll delve into it when I'm in the mood for it, and I promise you I will be in the mood for it eventually.Well I was in the mood for it and I found a beautiful hot pink/neon orange copy at the half priced book store. I kind of picked it up as a spur of the moment. Lately when I pick up books, I'll lose interest about 15 pages in. It's just that I have so much going on, it's hard to be in the mindset of wanting to spend hours reading. So I picked up this book, along with the Giver and Queer by William S. Burroughs. I loved this book. The prose was so exciting and fast paced that you really connect with the wired feeling of someone tripping on all sorts of hallucinogens. The book is not like the movie in the sense that it's psychedelic and difficult to follow. It's fast paced, and a little bit rambly, and thrilling, and humorous, and it even has a tinge of philosophy in it. Hunter S Thompson, at least with this book, is a poet. Not in a beautiful graceful way, but he has a no holds barred way with words to where you really get what he's saying, even if he has to offend a lot of people by saying it.This book isn't for everyone. People sensitive to drugs probably won't like it, but people that have come to terms with addiction (IE Addicts, families of addicts) will love it.I do have a few minor complaints. While I do greatly appreciate the tangents on modern society, I found myself getting lost in my own thoughts because they did drag at times. I loved the way he connected it though, and as soon as he got back to what was happening at the time it was very easy to get back in the swing of it.The other big complaint is that the book didn't really go anywhere. Sure it was thrilling, (view spoiler)[ He left Vegas without accomplishing any of his goals.  (hide spoiler)] That being said, there was a sort of blissful feeling at the end when he finally goes home. And it ended on a good note.I would give it a very modest 4.5/5*PS: I look forward to the works of William S Burroughs and Jack Kerouac because of this book."

Read this if its the last thing you do, no one should miss it."
"1924",1923,"Azzam Kamal","I wanna be Raoul, without the guilt."
"1925",1924,"Garry","I visited Las Vegas last year. I stayed in the new tourist strip; the one which is polished and manicured. But I also spent an evening in the REAL Vegas strip, the one of Fear and Loathing, the OLD tourist strip. The one that blinks like a firefly cavern, where casinos lure patrons with sparkling gemstone neons... emerald cacti, ruby cowboys, sapphire dollar signs. It's a place where the carpets have been stained so often over the years that your shoes stick to them slightly, no matter how clean they look.I'm reviewing Fear and Loathing as if it were a novel, but that's not how Hunter S Thompson wrote it. Originally commissioned in 1971 by Sports Illustrated to write a 1500 word article on the Mint 400 motorcycle race, Thompson submitted 15,000 words - these were promptly rejected. He then expanded it with a similar length article about a narcotics convention. The articles were eventually published in installments in Rolling Stone magazine, and were collated into a book the following year. It's not been out of print since.So, how does it stack up as a novel? Very well. Raul Duke (Hunter S Thompson) and his unnamed Samoan attorney (Oscar Acosta in real life) are drug fiends, and Fear and Loathing is an account of their excesses while covering the race and the convention. Reading the book is like taking a ride on a roller coaster... it doesn't really go anywhere, but it is entertaining and thrilling the whole way through. It's not a story, it's an experience.The writing is absolutely superb. The depictions of drug-induced hallucinations and paranoia are disturbing when you think about them, but they're also entertaining as all heck:I gripped the desk and sagged toward her as she held out the envelope, but I refused to accept it. The woman's face was CHANGING: swelling, pulsing... horrible green jowls and fangs jutting out, the face of a Moray eel! Deadly poison! I lunged backwards into my attorney, who gripped my arm as he reached out to take the note. ""I'll handle this,"" he said to the Moray woman. ""This man has a bad heart, but I have plenty of medicine. My name is Doctor Gonzo. Prepare our suite at once. We'll be in the bar.""The woman shrugged as he led me away. In a town full of bedrock crazies, nobody even NOTICES an acid freak. (p24)And this is indeed what happens in this novel. There is so much excess, so much crazy, that it becomes the norm. What I found interesting was my reaction to this. It was shocking at first, then I became immune to it, then I found it strangely appealing, then I got shocked by my reaction, then I took a step back and saw how sad it was. In most novels, the character goes through some sort of journey. But it was me, the reader, that had the journey with this book. For this, and for the excellent prose, I give Fear and Loathing 5 stars."
"1926",1925,"Kevin Kearney","I first read this in 1979 or so, in college. I handed it off to my apartment-mates, and none of us went to class for about the next week. It has one of the great opening lines of all time:""We were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when the drugs began to take hold. I remember saying something like 'I feel a bit lightheaded; maybe you should drive . . .' And suddenly there was a terrible roar all around us and the sky was full of what looked like huge bats, all swooping and screeching and diving around the car, which was going about a hundred miles an hour with the top down to Las Vegas. And a voice was screaming, 'Holy Jesus! What are these goddamn animals?'""It adds to the enjoyment to know that he wrote this as a distraction while being paid by Sports Illustrated (I recall) to write a short story about some racing event. The Ralph Steadman illustrations take the story over the top: Theirs was a collaboration akin to Lennon/McCartney."

"1931",1930,"Louise","Reading The Footloose American: Following the Hunter S. Thompson Trail Across South America all but required that this be the 5th book in my ""reading challenge"" (in 2014 read 10 books I've read at least 20 years ago). I picked up a well-worn copy at the library.Since its publication there have been many drug inspired poems, rants and narratives, but Thompson can't be beat. He's the gold standard of the genre. His prose, narrative and attitude are consistent from paragraph to punctuation.Thompson and his attorney are out to discover the American Dream in Las Vegas before the city went family friendly. Stoned on more alcohol and drugs than any human can survive, the pair zooms across the desert in the giant luxury cars of the day, running up hotel bills, damaging property and stealing tons of soap. There is little to no continuity in their experience as they move from place to place, meeting and abusing people as only addicts can.It is the heart of irony they attend a convention of District Attorneys and law enforcement personnel who specialize in drug laws.While it was written in the 1970's (with Nixon-era content) the style is that associated with the 1960's. It reads in a way that is still fresh and stylish after 40+ years. My read (""back then"") provoked some out loud laughing. This time around it provoked a few smiles and ""WOW"" moments.I wonder how millennials, if they were to read this, would relate to the imagery. There are giant cars, a reliance on pay phones, complex recording equipment (state of art for then), 29 cent hamburgers, and $2/per day rental car insurance. The many allusions to 60's/70's music create the backdrop for those who lived through this era; do they enrich the reading experience of young people? Would young people today recognize names like Melvin Belli, Sonny Barger or Caryl Chessman? or even Bob Zimmerman, Spiro Agnew or John Mitchell?There are recounts of conversations all too common for the era. My favorite one (I've heard hundreds of variations) was on p. 145 with Thompson, ""his attorney"" with a DA from Georgia. The illustrations by Ralph Steadman match the fear and loathing content.Anyone who wants a nostalgia trip to a glamorized drug life (that no one really led) will want to read (or maybe re-read) this book."

"1965",1964,"Antony Jauregui","Absolutely fascinating book about the true American dream. Probably got me into more trouble than if I had avoided it ;) .The descriptions of the drugs were phenomenal. It's interesting to see how other drugs were more prevalent in the early seventies like reds and ether. Thompson incorrectly predicts uppers will become obsolete and downers will be more prevalent in our time. It's definitely a must read for everyone who is curious about the drug world. "

One thing that I especially liked about this book is the style it is written in, it is journalistic yet still from the personal viewpoint of Hunter s Thompson. I would recommend this book for anyone interested in the aftermath of the ""psychedelic sixties"" or anyone looking to explore an interesting style of writing. To me this book speaks about commitment and giving 110% to whatever it is you are doing, even if what you are doing is raising hell and breaking rules in Las Vegas"

However, I understand that not everyone will love this book as much as I do, so I'll make it easy for you, just in case you should steer clear.DO NOT READ THIS BOOK IF:-you are a cop!- you liked nixon- you own more than one pair of fuzzy slippers- you've never heard of mescaline-you're a college freshman who saw the movie and thought you'd read a book for once- you've never had a drug- shall i put christians on the list also??OK that should be about it, the rest of you, go ahead, I swear it is a brilliant book because 1.) it's funny 2.) it's well written (considering an acid head wrote it) and 3.) hell! just fucking read it! I don't know! You either like it or you don't. But I don't trust the people who don't...P.S. I have not seen the movie... I don't want to!

"1986",1985,"Stephen Hugh","The novel that made Hunter S. Thompson a cultural icon. The story about a journalist and his doctor on a weekend excursion to Las Vegas to cover a motorcycle race turns into a chase for the American Dream and a reflection on the '60s culture.Thompson's writing is blunt, brutal and honest about the change of time period between the 60's and 70's and how everyone ended up losing out. Overall highly recommended."
"1987",1986,"Joseph Kay","Often times one has to decide weather the book or movie is superior when books turn into moving pictures. The outcomes always vary but more often than not a book is better than the movie (with few exceptions Fight Club comes to mind), but in this instance the book breaks perfectly even with the movie. It was an excellent read and made me pay a little more attention to the atmosphere rather than the direct action seen in the movie. I would say that movie and book are both equal and are both well executed. If you are looking for something to draw great lessons in life from or some prophetic humanistic realization and observation just keep on moving. This book is pure mindlessness in the form of heavy doses of hallucinogens and the view of the world from a person whom is self-entitled living in his misanthropic ways, as a 30 year old. Good stuff GOOD READ!"
"1988",1987,"Carmen","I read this in two sittings, pretty much over a weekend. I had received the film in my netflix queue and decided to borrow the book from a friend before watching it.

Thompson from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. An American classic about the end of the sixties, the advent of Nixon and the death of the American dream. At times hilarious, at times a lament for possibilities not realized, this book must be read and understood as a product of its time. The felt disenfranchisement pushes the two characters into a drug fueled frenzy that lasts throughout the novel. Thompson captures the spirit of the counter culture at the end of the sixties better than any author I've read (Ken Kelsey as one possible exception). For me, Thompson is the end of the 'beat' tradition that started with Kerouac and Burroughs and within that tradition, only Kerouac's On the Road can equal this book."

"2018",2017,"Sean Wilson","""It's called the American Dream, because you have to be asleep to believe it."" George CarlinParanoia. To me, it feels like the perfect personification of 1970's America.However, the decade before was an extreme 180° shift in collective perception as the counterculture era (or 'Flower Power') grasped America's youth. Psychedelia, recreational drug use, the hippie culture and more outward artistic expression held a more general acceptance within mainstream society. In other words, it was an attempt at a more laid back outlook on life. This was a short lived sociological experiment, as the Vietnam War raged on like an erratic forest fire, peace and love almost segued into an abstract concept after the Moon landing and Woodstock in 1969, and by the seventies, Flower Power was starting its painful decline in public consciousness.
""All those pathetically eager acid freaks who thought they could buy Peace and Understanding for three bucks a hit...""
And so we're thrown into some manic prose as Raoul Duke and Dr Gonzo embark on a trip from Los Angeles to Las Vegas in search of the American Dream. The book itself is a satirical black comedy, focusing on Duke's retrospective musings of the counterculture era, while also being a deadly serious, politically minded meditation on Nixon-era America. The aforementioned events as well as other events from the late sixties are deeply embedded into the rambling pages, while also making us laugh hysterically at these semi-autobiographical characters and their drug fueled adventures in the surrealistic and metaphysically delusional landscape of Nevada.One feels the paranoia filtering through the pages as Hunter S. Thompson lucidly describes the effects of ""two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high power blotter acid, a salt shaker half full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers..."" in mind-bending fashion. Reality itself is elevated into extreme subjectivity as the characters talk in and out of drug induced hallucinations. One wonders whether certain scenes actually happen, or whether it is an extended illusion, playing out in Duke's or Dr Gonzo's fried minds.In addition to all of this, simply enjoy and feel the beauty of this story. Hunter S. Thompson's acid fueled, uncensored prose is relentless in its execution and beautiful to read. When released in 1971, it was an early retrospective of the late sixties, but now it reads like a timeless 204 page book of nostalgia, insight and political unrest topped off with a seriously unhealthy dose of deliriousness and surrealism.
""Panic. It crept up my spine like the first rising vibes of an acid frenzy.""
For a blender full of seventies literary paranoia, read this, followed by Gravity's Rainbow and finally A Scanner Darkly... Enjoy!"
"2020",2019,"Delusional","The crazy and druged addled duo of ""Mr.Duke"" and ""The Samoan/Attourney"" are dragging themselves through the blinking lights and strange creatures of Las Vegas. As a big fan of the film (which I had seen many times previously to reading the book) I can honestly say that you don't necessary need to read the book to discover and experience something you've not seen in the film. Because the director Terry Gilliam did such a fine job including the inner dialogue and the story as a whole, you get pretty much the entire dose of the mischief the two acid heads find themselves in the middle of. With that being said the book is still disturbingly hillarious and outrageious. I didn't read throught it with my pair of analyzing glasses, mostly because I knew what it was about and I just wanted to enjoy the ride. Although the story is very vague and mostly consist of the two of them getting drugged out of their minds, speaking (Hillarious) gibberish and getting the inevitable fear. It is one of the best books I've ever read, because if offers some insight of a deluded and acidic mind of a drug addict, and of course their interpretation of the american dream (which is debatable). 5 Stars - it's funny, interesting, vividly described (possibly because I have seen the film and reading the hillarious dialogue through Johnny Depp's voice) This is a book you should read when you just want a good and weird time."

"2041",2040,"Hunter Fromholz","	Hunter S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas does a great job at really only one thing; explain the dangerous by being nearly incomprehensible. The book as a whole is only about how the drugs affect the people who use them, and how they had assimilated into the everyday life of many people.	The nature of this book may make it difficult to enjoy for many; it's about how he's a man who takes drugs, acts crazy, and, rather to do what is expected of him, wastes the time and money of his superiors. But despite the fact that the book follows only a couple of people, what it really does instead is describe how potentially thousands of people were living life. Only in a world in which many of the people around you be taking drugs could a couple of druggies hang out at a police conference. The book also describes how some people may have gotten dragged into the incredibly prevalent counterculture.	Thompson liked to continuously describe his travels as a search for the American Dream. Over and over he would ask people for its location, where this dream resides, but he never succeeded at finding it. The Dream's purpose in the story, however, was implemented very well. The never-ending search for a better ending could never be found by looking for it, if it existed at all. The depiction of a desire to hunt the unachievable further elaborated upon the lunacy invoked by the lifestyle.	The writing is very unique in that it's not what anyone will read in most novels. The novel is a bulk of wickedness at best, and a constant barrage of vulgarities at worst. While it may sound very negative from the way I put it, that's really the point; the writing style furthers emphasizes the negatives of the lifestyle and how drugs had a profound effect on those they influenced. Thompson really tries to describe his thought process as he went through that lifestyle, so as to let the reader know that the drugs were preventing him from thinking perfectly logically, and to achieve that goal he writes as if he were a raving lunatic half the time, only beginning to show some sense when he begins to sober up, before he reapplies the drugs. Yet, despite all the insanity he seems to possess, he still acts as if he truly believes he is being logical. He honestly believed that he had more control over himself than he truly did, and Thompson showed how that mentality can backfire when he describes the even more elaborate lunacy displayed by his attorney, a man who felt the need to advise Thompson despite his nearly murderous and self-destructive behavior, as well as his, and Thompson's recurring paranoia.	The book is a very interesting depiction of a counterculture far too present in one part of the nation. It goes beyond the simple idea that drugs ruin people and drive them mad, as well as how destructive they can become on a wider scale, to explain how they made people think and reason, and as a first-hand experience, it does so in an honest, accurate way."

"2059",2058,"Srivatsan Sridharan","Several years ago, I had come across this term called ""Gonzo Journalism"", a style of journalism coined and pioneered by Hunter S. Thompson, wherein the ""reporting"" is subjective and is heavily influenced by the mood of the journalist, unlike traditional journalism where the author is supposed to provide an objective view of things. ""Fear and Loathing"" is supposed to be the definitive treatise on Gonzo Journalism, a story where Thompson ""reports"" the debauchery of the drug infused post counter-culture movement that took place in the late 60s. Take for example, the blurb that appears on the book jacket: ""We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a salt shaker full of cocaine and a whole galaxy of multicolored uppers, downers, screamers and laughers....Also a quart of tequila, a quart of run, a case of Budweiser, a pint of raw ether, and two dozen amyls....But the only thing that worried me was the ether. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible than a man in the depths of an ether binge...""By indulging himself in the vices of that time, Thompson gives a first hand account of the filthy, cannot-get-any-worse kind of moral depravity and leaves the reader amused, excited and disgusted at the same time. While the theme of the book may not appeal to everyone, Thompson's writing style is fabulous, witty, entertaining as well as deeply thought provoking. Though the book is classified as a work of non-fiction, the boundaries between fiction and reality are blurred, perhaps, deliberately even. The cross references to Kerouac, Ginsberg, Kesey etc kind of create this nice web of beat generation writings (and a natural progression after Kerouac's On The Road) that transports you to that glorious literary era that sprung up in San Francisco, back in the 60s. After a long time, I read a book that was utterly unputdownable. Next up on my beat read list - ""The Doors of Perception"""

"2098",2097,"Monique Mihalitsianos","I’ve watched the movie they made about this book around four times, and even though some scenes are a little too much, I generally think it a funny and quirky film. I don’t get weirded out easily and my mind can take its fair dose of drug-centered abstract entertainment pretty well, and so the movie sits fine with me.The book, however, is an entirely different story. Some parts and dialogues are, to put it mildly, disgusting. I put it down in the middle and read another book because I so desperately needed a break, and that’s saying a lot. Anyone who knows me well knows I’m not a prude. Like I said, I don’t get weirded out easily. But this book actually did it. It weirded me out.Not because of the drugs, mind you, or not really. The drugs are present throughout the whole book. You practically get high just by reading it, but they never overpower the narrative. In fact, it’s the narrative that’s too much sometimes.It borders on insanity, completely out of control…And I usually like it when people get out of control. I think it can be healthy sometimes to blow off some steam sometimes. These guys, however, take it to a whole other level, a dark one.How dark? Read the book, find out. I don’t really want to repeat it. Some of those scenes are in the movie and I was more or less okay with them, but something about seeing it in print and really getting in the mind of Thompson and seeing how insane he went for a while really makes a difference.It’s well written, mind you. Or at least I think so. You feel exactly like you’re supposed to feel when you’re reading it: like you’ve been through an an eighty-hour heavy, heavy, HEAVY trip of mescaline, acid, ether, opium, and other drugs I can’t remember. It delivers the contextual reality of the narrator very efficiently, let’s put it that way. It’s also funny sometimes.And the underlying message is both clear and obscure: that the US in the 70′s was a savage, effed-up world where the American Dream was nothing short of a chimerical nonsense; an ideal, an unattainable desire, fed by the wave of hopes and dreams that the 60′s fueled until everyone discovered that that, too, was also a big old farce.Because there is no such thing as complete fulfillment. The American Dream is a lie. There’s only men and women trying to survive in the big old jungle we call western civilization.Pretty cool, Thompson. You kind of nailed it, and for that I give you props and my ever-sought-after literary approval.But by jove, did you have to be so gosh-darn creepy about it?"

"2104",2103,"Mihai Criveti","The title says it all, this book is one hell of an violent and depraved journey. It's brutal, but also quite funny.I'm also quite glad I never got a change to see the movie before reading this."
